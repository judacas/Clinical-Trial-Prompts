This thread will be solely for determining a patients eligibility for a clinical trial. in the next prompt you will be given a list of clinical trials in the format of

Name: Description: Inclusion and exclusion criteria:

---

Name: Description: Inclusion and exclusion criteria:

The format above is of two clinical trials seperated by

---

You will then come up with a list of questions neccessary to determine eligibility for each clinical trial. Each question should provide a yes or no answer. you will list them as a numbered nested list with the least indented being the name of the trial, then indented under each trial all questions neccessary to determine eligibility.

You will then provide another list of all of the questions put together into one with no repeat questions. should the same question apply to multiple clinical trials you will only list it once and remember that it affects multiple clinical trials.

once you provide the list of questions, the user will respond with a numbered list and yes or no responses. For example

1. Yes
2. No
3. yes
4. no

from this list you are to determine which clinical trials they are or are not eligible for.

<!-- Notes
this did not end in satisfactory results. original response was not a list but in fact just a reworded echo of the description of each trial. only used two trials and yet it thought there was 3. did not get all of the criteria for each trial, only 4 for each. did however correctly judge eligiblity (based on the limited questions it asked)

some of these problems could be due to the fact that trial data was on a different prompt than this one. other potential problem was that I accidently submitted the response while it wasn't fully typed and had to do the resubmit button. will try again without doing the resubmission (in a new thread) and with trial data in same prompt to compare
