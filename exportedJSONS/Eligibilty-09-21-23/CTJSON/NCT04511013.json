Encorafenib and binimetinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Ipilimumab and nivolumab are monoclonal antibodies that may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. This trial aims to find out which approach is more effective in shrinking and controlling brain metastases from melanoma.", "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To compare progression-free survival (PFS) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 between participants randomized to the triplet combination of encorafenib + binimetinib + nivolumab versus the doublet combination of ipilimumab + nivolumab among participants with BRAF-V600 mutant melanoma that has metastasized to the brain.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To estimate the overall survival (OS) of participants in each treatment arm. II. To estimate the objective response rate (ORR) (confirmed and unconfirmed, complete and partial responses) per RECIST 1.1 in each treatment arm.\n\nIII. To estimate the intracranial response rate (ICRR), defined as confirmed and unconfirmed complete and partial response per modified RECIST for brain metastases (mRECIST).\n\nIV. To evaluate the duration of response, per RECIST 1.1 and the duration of ICRR per mRECIST, and per Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO)-Brain Metastases (BM) (and immunotherapy \\[i\\]RANO) in each treatment arm.\n\nV. To evaluate the toxicity profile of each treatment arm. VI. To evaluate current and emerging radiographic response criteria (modified RECIST 1.1, modified RANO-BM and iRANO) by a retrospective blinded independent centralized review (BICR) of banked images.\n\nBANKING OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To bank tumor tissue, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), stool and blood samples for future correlative studies.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM I: Patients receive encorafenib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28, binimetinib PO twice daily (BID) on days 1-28, and nivolumab intravenously (IV) on day 1. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nARM II: Patients receive nivolumab IV on day 1 of all cycles and ipilimumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1 of cycles 1-4. Cycles repeat every 21 days for 4 cycles and then every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually until 3 years after randomization."}, "eligibilityModule": {"eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Participants must have histologically and pathologically confirmed melanoma that has metastasized to the brain\n* Any primary (cutaneous, acral/mucosal, etc) or unknown origin are permitted, except that participants with uveal primary are not eligible\n* Participants must have BRAF-V600 mutant melanoma documented by a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA)-certified laboratory\n* All participants must have an magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain within 28 days prior to registration and must have central nervous system metastases with at least one measurable brain metastasis \\>= 0.5 cm in size (per modified RECIST 1.1) that has not been irradiated, or progressed (in the opinion of the treating physician) after prior radiation therapy.

In addition to routine contraceptive methods, \"effective contraception\" also includes heterosexual celibacy and surgery intended to prevent pregnancy (or with a side-effect of pregnancy prevention) defined as a hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral tubal ligation. However, if at any point a previously celibate participant chooses to become heterosexually active during the time period for use of contraceptive measures outlined in the protocol, he/she is responsible for beginning contraceptive measures", "healthyVolunteers": false, "sex": "ALL", "minimumAge": "18 Years", "stdAges": ["ADULT", "OLDER_ADULT"]}}}
