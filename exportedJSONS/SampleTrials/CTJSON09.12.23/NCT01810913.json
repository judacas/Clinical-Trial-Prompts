Specialized radiation therapy that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin and docetaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Cetuximab is a monoclonal antibody that may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. The purpose of this study is to compare the usual treatment (radiation therapy with cisplatin chemotherapy) to using radiation therapy with docetaxel and cetuximab chemotherapy, and using the usual treatment plus an immunotherapy drug, atezolizumab.", "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To select the better docetaxel-based experimental arm to improve disease-free survival (DFS) over the control arm of radiation and cisplatin. (Phase II) (COMPLETE AS OF 20-MAR-2020) II. To determine if the combination of docetaxel-cetuximab and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is superior in terms of overall survival (OS) compared to standard cisplatin and IMRT in the adjuvant treatment of pathologic high risk, human papillomavirus (HPV)-negative head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). (Phase III) III. To determine if the combination of atezolizumab, cisplatin, and IMRT is superior in terms of OS compared to standard cisplatin and IMRT in the adjuvant treatment of pathologic high risk, HPV-negative HNSCC. (Phase III)\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To compare disease-free survival (DFS) between each experimental arm and the control arm. (Phase III) II. To determine whether each experimental arm improves local-regional disease control and the rate of distant metastasis. (Phase III) III. To compare acute toxicity profiles between each experimental arm and the control arm. (Phase III) IV. To compare late toxicity profiles at 1, 3, and 5 years after treatment. (Phase III) V. To assess long term DFS and OS between each experimental arm and the control arm. (Phase III) VI. To compare symptom burden, as measured by the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory - Head and Neck (MDASI-HN) (primary patient reported outcome \\[PRO\\]), and quality of life, as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Head and Neck (FACT-H\\&N) (secondary PRO), between each experimental arm and the control arm.
