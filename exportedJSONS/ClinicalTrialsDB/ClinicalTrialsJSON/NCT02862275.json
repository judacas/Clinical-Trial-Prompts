Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.", "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To evaluate the safety of atezolizumab (MPDL3280A) administration in patients who have received adoptive cell transfer (ACT) prior to enrollment.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the expansion of engrafted T cells following atezolizumab administration in the peripheral blood and within the tumor microenvironment.\n\nII. To evaluate the phenotype and function of engrafted T cells following atezolizumab administration.\n\nIII. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. IV. To evaluate the response rate using immune related Response Criteria (irRC) and Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v)1.1, or other tumor-specific criteria.\n\nV. To evaluate survival outcomes and progression free survival using irRC and RECIST v1.1, or other tumor-specific criteria.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive atezolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30- 60 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 21 days for a total of 17 doses over up to 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and biopsy on study. Patients also undergo blood sample collection on study.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and then every 3 months thereafter.", "eligibilityModule": {"eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Histologically or pathologically confirmed malignancy (hematologic or solid tumor) that is metastatic or unresectable and for which standard of care therapy does not exist or is no longer effective\n* ACT infusion prior to study enrollment (cohorts include ACT with tumor infiltrating lymphocytes \\[TIL\\], human leukocyte antigen \\[HLA\\]-class I T cell receptor \\[TCR\\]-engineered lymphocytes, HLA-class II TCR-engineered lymphocytes, and chimeric antigen receptor \\[CAR\\]-engineered T cells)\n* Prior ACT therapy should be completed, and residual disease documented by either radiographic progression or active disease observed on biopsy (i.e. hematologic or solid tumor malignancy must be deemed active by the treating investigator); the investigator may deem that the disease is active on the basis of a pre-treatment biopsy demonstrating viable tumor cells or clinical progression of disease (i.e. RECIST progression is not required)\n* Solid tumor patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for non-nodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as \\>= 20 mm (\\>= 2 cm) with conventional techniques or as \\>= 15 mm (\\>= 1.5 cm) with spiral computed tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or calipers by clinical exam\n\n  * Leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients must have measurable disease according to the revised response criteria for malignant lymphoma\n* Disease suitable for assessment by pre- and post-biopsies\n* There is no limit to the number of lines of prior therapy; prior anti-programmed cell death (PD)-1 or anti-PD-ligand (L)1 therapy and other immunotherapies are allowed\n* Prior anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy may not be administered after ACT and before study atezolizumab (MPDL3280A) administration\n* All ACT related toxicities resolved to grade 1 with the exception of alopecia, vitiligo and endocrine abnormalities requiring replacement therapy which may be grade 2\n* No prior other anti-cancer therapy, including ACT, for 28 days prior to study administration of atezolizumab\n* Age \\>= 18 years.
