The type of radiation is called stereotactic ablative body radiation therapy (SABR). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects, good and/or bad, of pre-operative SABR specifically focusing on its ability to reduce the chances that additional breast surgery will be needed, reducing the amount of breast/heart/lung tissue that is irradiated, and to study the tumor-tissue effects of SABR. The usual treatment for patients with early-stage breast cancer who have breast-conserving treatment (BCT) is to receive radiotherapy AFTER surgery, targeting either the whole breast or part of the breast.", "detailedDescription": null, "eligibilityModule": {"eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Understand and voluntarily sign an informed consent document prior to conducting any study related assessments or procedures.\n* Histologically proven invasive adenocarcinoma of breast.\n* Must have marker clip indicating location of target tumor in breast.\n* Unifocal tumor less than or equal to 2 cm based on contrast-enhanced prone-breast MRI.\n* Must be clinically and radiographically node negative (N0) to participate on this protocol. Clinically suspicious regional nodes by imaging or physical exam require biopsy evaluation to exclude disease involvement.\n* Appropriate candidate for breast-conserving surgery based on multi-disciplinary assessment.\n* Females age \u2265 50 years.\n* Able to tolerate prone body positioning during radiation therapy.\n* No prior ipsilateral-breast or thoracic radiotherapy.\n* As defined on MRI, target lesion must be at least 10 mm distance from skin (defined as volume encompassing first 3 mm from breast surface).\n* Must be estrogen receptor (ER) positive.\n* Must be negative for Her-2 amplification. (Either 1+ on semi-quantitative evaluation of immunostain or negative by fluorescent in-situ hybridization).\n* No implanted hardware or other material that would prohibit appropriate treatment planning or treatment delivery in the investigator's opinion.\n* No history of an invasive malignancy (other than this breast cancer, or non-metastatic basal or squamous skin cancers) in the last 5 years.\n* Must not have received nor be planned for neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to SABR or surgery.\n* ECOG performance status less than 2.\n* Females of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test prior to simulation and within seven days of SABR start.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Have invasive lobular carcinoma.\n* Have a Tumor \\> 2 cm as measured on prone contrast-enhanced breast MRI.\n* Have presence of histologically proven lymph node disease.\n* Are not a candidate for breast conserving surgery.\n* Have had prior ipsilateral-breast or thoracic radiotherapy.\n* History of scleroderma or lupus erythematosus with either cutaneous manifestation or requiring active treatment.\n* An MRI defined target tumor that is within 10 mm of skin (defined as volume encompassing first 3 mm from skin surface).\n* Have amplification of Her-2 (Either 3+ by semi-quantitative immunostain or positive by Fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH)).\n* Have implanted hardware or other material that would prohibit appropriate treatment planning or treatment delivery in the investigator's opinion.\n* History of an invasive malignancy (other than this breast cancer, or non-metastatic basal or squamous skin cancers) in the last 5 years.\n* Have received or plan to receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy either before radiotherapy or before surgery.\n* A known carrier of BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation.\n* Pregnant or unwilling to undergo pregnancy screening.", "healthyVolunteers": false, "sex": "FEMALE", "minimumAge": "50 Years", "stdAges": ["ADULT", "OLDER_ADULT"]}}
