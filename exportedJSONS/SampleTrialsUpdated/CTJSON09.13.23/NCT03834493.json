There are two primary study hypotheses.\n\nHypothesis 1: The combination of pembrolizumab plus enzalutamide is superior to placebo plus enzalutamide with respect to Overall Survival (OS).\n\nHypothesis 2: The combination of pembrolizumab plus enzalutamide is superior to placebo plus enzalutamide with respect to Radiographic Progression-free Survival (rPFS) per Prostate Cancer Working Group (PCWG)-modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as assessed by blinded independent central review."}, "eligibilityModule": {"eligibilityCriteria": "The main inclusion and exclusion criteria include but are not limited to the following:\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n* Has histologically- or cytologically-confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate without small cell histology\n* Has prostate cancer progression while on androgen deprivation therapy (or post bilateral orchiectomy) within 6 months prior to randomization\n* Has current evidence of metastatic disease documented by either bone lesions on bone scan and/or soft tissue disease by computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (CT/MRI)\n* Has met one of the following criteria with regard to abiraterone acetate exposure: (1) is abiraterone-na\u00efve; (2) received prior abiraterone acetate for the treatment of mHSPC or mCRPC, for a minimum of 4 weeks and not progressed while on treatment; or (3) received prior abiraterone acetate for the treatment of mHSPC or mCRPC and progressed on treatment after a minimum of 8 weeks treatment (minimum 14 weeks for those with bone progression)\n* Has ongoing androgen deprivation with serum testosterone \\<50 ng/dL (\\<2.0 nM)\n* Participants receiving bone resorptive therapy (including, but not limited to, bisphosphonate or denosumab) must have been on stable doses prior to randomization\n* Participants must agree to the following during the study treatment period and for at least 90 days after the last dose of enzalutamide: Refrain from donating sperm, plus EITHER be abstinent OR must agree to use male condom\n* Has provided newly obtained core or excisional biopsy (obtained within 12 months of screening) from soft tissue not previously irradiated (samples from tumors progressing in a prior site of radiation are allowed).
