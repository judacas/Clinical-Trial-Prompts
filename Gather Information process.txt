notes: should change alternate name or description to extra notes since it can be extra specifications or misceallenous
should also make sure that chatgpt doesn't respond with something like 

"Thank you for providing the necessary information. I understand the task at hand.

GPT4 also likes to add extra things at the final response which is meant for the code. need to add something which tells gpt that the last response is not for the user and needs to be exactly as stated for parsing purposes.
