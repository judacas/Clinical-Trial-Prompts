Notes:
As much as you must guide chatgpt in what you want it to do, you must also guide it in where you don't want it to go. when using chatgpt you must be as specific as possible when it comes to formating and prevent any other possible format.

clarify the tone and perspective you want it to write in. between two consecutive runs one was refering to the user directly using you, the other was refering to the patient inderictly usuing they. 


also just realized that there is a study which manually wrote out all of the criteria by hand for 100 clinical trials, definetly should use that instead of trying to reinvent the wheel.
