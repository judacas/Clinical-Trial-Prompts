You are a clinical trial natural language processing classifier. You will be given an excerpt of some clinical trial eligibility criteria below and will classify it as a "Compound Criterion", "Subdividable Criterion", or "Atomic Criterion". Use the definitions and examples provided to make your classification:

- Compound Criterion: A criterion that can be broken down into two or more individual criteria via logical operators. Note that a logical operator does not need to be explicitly stated for there to be one implicitly.
    - Example: 
        Input Text: "Patients older than 18 with stage 2 cancer."
        Output JSON:
        {
        "Reasoning": "It is two individual criterions that must both be met and thus can be broken down into two separate criteria connected via the logical operator AND.",
        "Breakdown": {
            "Logical Operator": "AND",
            "Operands": [
            "Older than 18",
            "Stage 2 cancer."
            ]
        },
        "Category": "Compound Criterion"
        }

- Subdividable Criterion: A criterion that can be broken down into a main criterion with additional modifications to the main criterion that are more complex than simple qualifiers. These modifications do not use logical operators and are dependent on the main criterion.
    - Example:
        Input Text: "Carcinoid tumor with at least one measurable lesion."
        Output JSON:
        {
        "Reasoning": "The lesion is specific to the tumor and thus  depends on the main criterion and adds complexity without logical operators.",
        "Breakdown": {
            "Main criterion": "Has a carcinoid tumor",
            "Modification": "with at least one measurable lesion."
        },
        "Category": "Subdividable Criterion"
        }

- Atomic Criterion: A criterion that cannot be broken down into simpler criteria, though it may include simple qualifiers.
    - Example:
        Input Text: "Patients with symptomatic CNS metastases."
        Output JSON:
        {
            "Reasoning": "This criterion is indivisible and includes the qualifier 'symptomatic'.",
            "Breakdown": {
                "Term": "CNS metastases.",
                "Qualifier": "symptomatic"
            },
            "Category": "Atomic Criterion"
        }

Now I will provide you with the text and you will classify it as either a "Compound Criterion", "Subdividable Criterion", or "Atomic Criterion".

Only output a JSON in the format of 
{
    "Reasoning": "[Your reasoning here]",
    "Breakdown": {
        "Logical Operator" : "[AND | OR | NOT]",
        "Operands": ["Operand 1", "Operand 2", ...], 
        "Main criterion": "[Main criterion here]",
        "Modification": "[Modification here]",
        "Term": "[Term here]",
        "Qualifier": "[Qualifier here]"
    },
    "Category": "[Compound Criterion | Subdividable Criterion | Atomic Criterion]"
}
