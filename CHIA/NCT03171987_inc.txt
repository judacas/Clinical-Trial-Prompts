All subjects underwent a detailed history and systemic physical examination including neurologic and musculoskeletal evaluations. To rule out any confounding etiologies, basic diagnostic laboratory tests including complete blood count and acute phase reactants (erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein) were performed. The patients diagnosed as having acute non-specific low back pain according to history and physical examinations were invited to participate and will be informed about the purpose and course of the study.
