Patients with a clinical diagnosis of depression who in the judgement of their physician require medication management may be eligible for enrollment. A score of 10 or more on the PHQ-9 instrument will be required for enrollment.
Some practices utilize the PHQ-2 and PHQ-9 are part of routine screening for depression. If the tests are performed routinely, they do not need to be repeated for study eligibility, and may be performed prior to informed consent for this study. If, however, the PHQ-9 is not routinely performed, informed consent must be performed prior to administration. Patients with a score below 10 will be considered screen failures and will not be enrolled or offered the MYnd testing.
Patients with non-psychotic comorbid conditions may be included.
Patients must be either medication treatment naÃ¯ve for behavioral illnesses or have no active medication treatments for at least 1 month prior to enrollment. Prohibited medications at the time of enrollment will include stimulants, benzodiazepines and THC. Prior therapy with these agents is permitted with a washout of >30 days.
Patients must have private medical insurance coverage through Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield. This is limited to insured commercial members, including HMO, and excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, members of self-insured customers or Medicare or Medicaid programs.
