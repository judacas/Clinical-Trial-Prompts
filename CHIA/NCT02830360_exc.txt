Unable or unwilling to provide informed consent.
Active ischemia (acute thrombus diagnosed by coronary angiography, or dynamic ST segment changes demonstrated on ECG) or another reversible cause of VT (e.g. drug-induced arrhythmia), had recent acute coronary syndrome within 30 days, coronary revascularization (<90 days bypass surgery, <30 days percutaneous coronary intervention), or have CCS functional class IV angina. Note that biomarker level elevation alone after ventricular arrhythmias does not denote acute coronary syndrome or active ischemia.
Are ineligible to take the antiarrhythmic drug to which they would be assigned due to allergy, intolerance or contraindication
Are known to have protruding left ventricular thrombus or mechanical aortic and mitral valves
Have had a prior catheter ablation procedure for VT
Are in renal failure (Creatinine clearance <15 mL/min), have NYHA Functional class IV heart failure, or a systemic illness likely to limit survival to <1 year
Have had recent ST elevation myocardial infarction or non-ST elevation MI (< 30 days); note that biomarker elevation alone after ventricular arrhythmias does not denote MI.
Are pregnant.
