T17	Non-query-able 311 691	The patient must be evaluated by a "heart team" of physicians including an interventional cardiologist, cardiothoracic surgeon, heart failure specialist, and imaging specialist, and presented for review at a local multi-disciplinary conference. By consensus, the heart team must agree (and verify in the case review process) that valve implantation will likely benefit the patient
T18	Non-query-able 694 1506	The heart team must agree that medical factors preclude operation, based on a conclusion that the probability of death or serious, irreversible morbidity exceeds the probability of meaningful improvement. Also, other factors which may increase the patients perceived surgical risk for inclusion in the trial will be clearly delineated if they are present. These include, but are not limited to the following as defined by VARC 2: Frailty, Hostile chest, porcelain aorta, IMA or other critical conduit crossing the midline or adherent to the posterior table of sternum, severe right ventricular (RV) dysfunction. The surgeons' consultation notes shall specify the medical or anatomic factors leading to that conclusion. At least one of the cardiac surgeon assessors must have interviewed and examined the patient.
T19	Post-eligibility 1508 1662	The study patient provides informed consent and agrees to comply with all required post-procedure follow-up visits, including annual visits up to 5 years.
