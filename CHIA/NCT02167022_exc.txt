1. Diagnosis: Diagnosis of CP secondary to neuronal migration. 
2. Co-morbidities: Medical conditions that may prevent the administration of rehabilitation therapies at the intensity required by the study, or that may compromise the study ability to maintain blindness, or that have a co-morbidity not typically associated with CP (i.e. cancer, cystic fibrosis). 
3. Co-interventions: Anticipated pharmacological intervention or procedure or participation in other studies that may interfere with this study.
