T21	Pregnancy_considerations 448 1228	Potentially fertile women should use high reliability contraceptive methods (Pearl-Index <1) in order to avoid pregnancy during the entire duration of the study and up to 6 weeks after the end of their treatment with Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF). Potentially Fertile Women include any woman who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation or bilateral oophorectomy) or who is not post-menopausal (defined as amenorrhea = 12 consecutive months, or women who are receiving hormone replacement therapy with a documented level of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)> 35 mlU / ml). Potentially fertile women must have a pregnancy test with a negative result in the 72 hours prior to the start of the trial.
T22	Pregnancy_considerations 1230 1573	Sexually active males (including vasectomized males) who are being treated with MMF must accept the use of barrier contraceptive methods during MMF treatment and for 90 days thereafter. Potentially fertile partners of these patients should use a reliable contraceptive method during the same period, in order to minimize the risk of pregnancy.
T23	Non-query-able 1575 1771	Patients must agree not to donate blood during treatment with MMF and during the 6 subsequent weeks. Males should not make a sperm donation during MMF treatment and up to 90 days after completion.
