Heart Team assessment of operability (the heart team considers the patient to be a good surgical candidate).
Evidence of an acute myocardial infarction = 1 month (30 days) before the intended treatment [defined as: Q wave MI, or non-Q wave MI with total CK elevation of CK-MB = twice normal in the presence of MB elevation and/or troponin level elevation (WHO definition)].
Untreated, severe, left sided valvular heart disease including mitral regurgitation or stenosis, and aortic regurgitation or stenosis.
Mean pulmonary artery pressures =40mmHG and PVR >4 woods units as assessed by right heart catheterization.
Any therapeutic invasive cardiac procedure resulting in a permanent implant that is performed within 30 days of the index procedure. Examples of permanent implant would include any new heart valve. Implantation of a permanent pacemaker is excluded.
Patients with planned concomitant surgical or transcatheter ablation for Atrial Fibrillation.
Leukopenia (WBC < 3000 cell/mL), acute anemia (Hgb < 9 g/dL), Thrombocytopenia (Plt < 50,000 cell/mL).
Hemodynamic or respiratory instability requiring inotropic support, mechanical ventilation or mechanical heart assistance within 30 days of screening evaluation.
Need for emergency surgery for any reason.
Left ventricular ejection fraction <40%.
Echocardiographic evidence of intracardiac mass, thrombus or vegetation.
Active upper GI bleeding within 3 months (90 days) prior to procedure.
A known contraindication or hypersensitivity to all anticoagulation regimens, or inability to be anticoagulated for the study procedure.
Recent CVA clinically confirmed (by neurologist) or neuroimaging confirmed stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within 6 months (180 days) of the procedure.
Estimated life expectancy < 1 year from conditions other than TR.
Expectation that patient will not improve despite treatment of tricuspid regurgitation
Currently participating in another investigational cardiac device study or any other clinical trial, including drugs or biologics. Note: Trials requiring extended follow-up for products that were investigational, but have since become commercially available, are not considered investigational trials.
Active bacterial endocarditis within 6 months (180 days) of procedure.
Patients with signs or symptoms of SVC syndrome, or hepatic cirrhosis not felt due to passive congestion from TR.
