T1	Non-query-able 0 383	Habitual exerciser defined as = 30 minutes of at least moderate or high intensity exercise = 3 times per week. After consent, and at the subsequent screening visit, a VO2 max test will be performed, and subjects with a low value (< 35 mL/kg/min) will be excluded (screen failure). Based on our previous experience, we anticipate that <10% of the subjects will fall into this category
