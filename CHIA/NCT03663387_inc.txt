Male and female subjects between 40-85 years old will be enrolled. Younger subjects are not included as the risk for brain amyloid lesions is too low
All subjects will speak English as their first language or demonstrate proficiency in English (defined as reaching a scaled score of > 11 on the WAIS vocabulary test).
All subjects will have normal cognition at baseline: a Clinical Dementia Rating CDR=0, Global Deterioration Scale GDS<2.
All subjects will be in good general health and able to participate in the LP and imaging exams. This determination is made by the study neurologist and reviewed at a consensus meeting for each subject.
