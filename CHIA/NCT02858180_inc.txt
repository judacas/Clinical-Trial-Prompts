Chronic HCV Infection of Genotype 1, 4, 5, or 6
HCV RNA > 103 IU/mL at screening
18 years of age or older
Diagnosis of chronic HCV infection, defined as positive HCV antibody or HCV RNA more than 6 months prior to screening OR an assessment of fibrosis F2 or greater prior to screening.
NYHA Class III: Subjects with cardiac disease resulting in marked limitation of physical activity. They are comfortable at rest. Less than ordinary physical activity causes fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea, or anginal pain.
NYHA Class IV: Patient with cardiac disease resulting in inability to carry on any physical activity without discomfort. Symptoms of cardiac insufficiency or of the anginal syndrome may be present even at rest. If any physical activity is undertaken, discomfort is increased.
ejection fraction = 30%
hospitalized for heart failure in last 12 months
ILD criteria: diagnosis of interstitial lung disease with chronic supplemental oxygen requirement at rest and/or with exertion.
Forced expiratory volume (FEV1)< 30% predicted
OR any FEV1 with chronic supplemental oxygen requirement at rest and/or with exertion
OR any FEV1 with chronic hypercapnia (baseline partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide [PaCO2] > 45)
