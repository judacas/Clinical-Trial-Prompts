Adult (= 18 years old) subjects with chronic genotype 1 HCV and NCI with a GDS greater than or equal to 0.5 (n=60).
Presence of chronic HCV infection based on chart review will be defined as positive for anti-HCV antibody or HCV RNA at least 6 months before screening.
For the HIV/HCV co-infected group only, subjects must have HIV. HIV status will be obtained through self report. Self report will be confirmed at screening using a HIV-1 point of care test. In the event that point of care test and self-report are discordant, then HIV status will be confirmed by a licensed Western blot or a second antibody test.
HIV/HCV co-infected subjects (n=12) must also have a HIV RNA measurement <50 copies/mL at the pre-treatment visit.
Platelets >150,000
Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) <10x upper limit of normal
Creatinine clearance >30 milliliters/minute/1.73 centimeter squared
