Habitual exerciser defined as = 30 minutes of at least moderate or high intensity exercise = 3 times per week. After consent, and at the subsequent screening visit, a VO2 max test will be performed, and subjects with a low value (< 35 mL/kg/min) will be excluded (screen failure). Based on our previous experience, we anticipate that <10% of the subjects will fall into this category
Men: (0.006012 x H3) + (14.6 x W) + 604 = TBV
Women: (0.005835 x H3) + (15 x W) + 183 = TBV [H=height in inches; W=weight in pounds]
Has access to transportation to visit the blood collection facility and to return to Stony Brook for all study visits.
