T1	Non-representable 0 1178	a licensed rapid HIV test or HIV enzyme or chemiluminescence immunoassay (E/CIA) test kit at any time prior to study entry and confirmed by a licensed Western blot or a second antibody test by a method other than the initial rapid HIV and/or E/CIA, or by HIV-1 antigen or plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load. NOTE: The term "licensed" refers to a United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved kit, which is required for all IND studies, or for sites located in countries other than the United States, a kit that has been certified or licensed by an oversight body within that country and validated internally. Non-US sites are encouraged to use US FDA-approved methods for IND studies. WHO (World Health Organization) and CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) guidelines mandate that confirmation of the initial test result must use a test that is different from the one used for the initial assessment. A reactive initial rapid test should be confirmed by either another type of rapid assay or an E/CIA that is based on a different antigen preparation and/or different test principle (eg, indirect versus competitive), or a Western blot or a plasma HIV-1 RNA.
