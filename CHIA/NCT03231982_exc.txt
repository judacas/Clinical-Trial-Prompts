The difference in blood pressure between the selected arm versus non-selected arm is = 20 mmHg for siSBP and = 10 mmHg for siDBP at Visit 1 (screening).
Blood pressure taken at screening and randomization is = 180 mmHg for siSBP or = 110 mmHg for siDBP.
Diagnosed with secondary hypertension or suspected of secondary hypertension [e.g., renovascular disease, adrenal medullary and cortical hyperfunction, coarctation of the aorta, hyperaldosteronism, unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, Cushing's syndrome, pheochromocytoma, polycystic kidney disease, etc.]
Patients with symptomatic orthostatic hypertension (the difference in the blood pressures between measured at supine position and measured at standing position is = 20 mmHg for siSBP and = 10 mmHg for siDBP)
Diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) or uncontrolled DM (patients on insulin therapy or with HbA1c > 9%)
Patients with severe cardiac conditions: heart failure (NYHA Class 3 or 4), history of ischemic cardiac disease (unstable angina, myocardial infarction), peripheral vascular diseases, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty or coronary artery bypass graft within recent 6 months.
Patients with clinically significant ventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter or other clinically significant arrhythmia at the discretion of the investigator
Patients with hypertrophic occlusive myocardiopathy, severe occlusive coronary artery disease, aortic stenosis, hemodynamically significant aortic valve or mitral valve stenosis
History of cardiogenic shock
Presence of severe cerebrovascular disorders (diagnosis of stroke, cerebral infarction or cerebral hemorrhage within recent 6 months)
History or current evidence of wasting, autoimmune (such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus) or connective tissue diseases
Known diagnosis of moderate or malignant retinopathy (including retinal hemorrhage, visual disturbance and retinal microaneurysm within 6 months)
Patients with surgical or medical intestinal diseases or having received surgeries that could interfere with drug absorption distribution, metabolism and elimination
History of malignancy including leukemia and lymphoma within recent 5 years except for localized basal cell carcinoma of the skin)
Patients with any inflammatory diseases requiring chronic anti-inflammatory therapy
Renal failure on dialysis
AST or ALT >2 x upper limit of normal (ULN)
Serum creatinine > 1.5 x ULN
Serum potassium < 3.5 mmol/L or >5.5 mmol/L
Needs for co-administration of non-study antihypertensive agents or contraindicated medications during the study
History of hypersensitivity to ARBs or dihydropyridines
History of angioedema to treatment with ACE inhibitors or ARBs
Pregnant or lactating women and female volunteers of childbearing potential (except for women who are surgically sterile) who are not willing to use an adequate method of contraception (oral contraceptives, intrauterine device, condom, etc.) during the study. Women of childbearing potential who are not surgically sterile will be allowed to participate in the study only if they have negative pregnancy test at Visit 1 (screening) and should continue to use medically acceptable method of contraception (basic body temperature method and rhythm method will not be allowed). Women with no menses for = 12 months will be considered as postmenopausal state and method of contraception using hormonal contraception such as oral contraceptive should be initiated from or prior to the screening.
History of drug or alcohol abuse within recent 1 year
Patients having received any other investigational product within recent 12 weeks
Conditions which render a subject ineligible for the study at the discretion of the investigator
