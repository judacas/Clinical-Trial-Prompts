Requirement for vasoactive drugs via a central venous catheter for the treatment of shock. Shock will be defined as mean arterial pressure less than 70 mmHg or systolic blood pressure less than 100 mmHg despite administration of at least 1000 mL of crystalloid or 500 mL of colloid, unless there is an elevation in the central venous pressure to > 12 mmHg or in the pulmonary artery occlusion pressure to > 14 mmHg coupled with signs of tissue hypoperfusion (e.g. altered mental state, mottled skin, urine output < 0.5 mL/kg body weight for one hour, or a serum lactate level of > 2 mmol per liter).
