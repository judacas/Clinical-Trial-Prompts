T28	Post-eligibility 765 1290	The subject's treating physician has determined that they should receive either tobramycin or colistin intravenously as one of the designated agents for their APE treatment. Subjects who are able to receive either tobramycin or colistin as part of their antibiotic regimen will be randomized into one of three arms. If a treating physician deems that a subject cannot receive tobramycin due to vestibular toxicity, ototoxicity or bacterial resistance, the subject will be randomized to either standard or PK-adjusted colistin
