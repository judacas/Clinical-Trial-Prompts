This study is to see if tumor features in blood and imaging prior to surgery correspond with tumor heterogeneity in the specimen after surgery.", "detailedDescription": "This study is to prospectively determine whether there is a predictive relationship in RPC between pre-operative radiomic imaging features and pathologic tumor heterogeneity, delineated by gene-expression-based RSI and histologic measures of hypoxia measured by Glut-1 and CA-IX as well as the degree of pimonidazole staining.", "eligibilityModule": {"eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* 18 years of age and older who have biopsy-proven resectable pancreatic cancer\n* Participants must have a histological diagnosis of pancreatic head ductal adenocarcinoma at least \u2265 1 cm from ampula.\n* Participants must be able to undergo all 3 imaging modalities.\n* Participants' medical statuses must be considered appropriate for surgery and for general anesthesia.\n* Female participants and female partners of male participants undergoing optional PET-CT or CT pancreatic protocol scan cannot be pregnant or nursing, as confirmed by serum pregnancy test if the patient is a woman of child-bearing potential.\n* All female participants of child-bearing potential must agree to use birth control, including oral, injectable, or mechanical contraception, abstinence, or vasectomy for 30 days following pimonidazole administration.\n* Adequate kidney and liver function as assessed by laboratory studies. Laboratory studies must be completed within 28 days prior to pimonidazole administration;\n* Must be capable of providing informed consent and demonstrate a willingness to comply with all the study procedures and visits;\n* Must be able to undergo MRI scans without having a pacemaker or other indwelling metal, which would contraindicate the scan.\n* Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score of 0 to 2.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding\n* Participants who are contraindicated for MRI or gadolinium contrast agents.\n* If the patient has an iodine contrast allergy, they must be able to take standard pre-medications so they can safely undergo a CT scan.\n* Participants with a known active cancer with a prognosis that would contraindicate a curative intent pancreatic resection.\n* Participants with depressed liver function, as assessed with a screening liver function test yielding serum ALT or AST greater than the IULN or total bilirubin greater than 2 mg/dL.\n* Presence of any other co-existing condition, which, in the judgment of the investigator, might increase the risk to the patient.", "healthyVolunteers": false, "sex": "ALL", "minimumAge": "18 Years", "stdAges": ["ADULT", "OLDER_ADULT"]}}
