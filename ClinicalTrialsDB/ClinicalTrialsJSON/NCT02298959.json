Ziv-afibercept works by decreasing blood and nutrient supply to the tumor, which may result in shrinking the tumor. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving ziv-aflibercept together with pembrolizumab may be a better treatment for patients with advanced solid tumors.", "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine the safety, tolerability and recommended phase II dosing for the combination of ziv-aflibercept plus MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) in patients with unresectable stage III or stage IV melanoma, renal cell cancer, ovarian cancer, colorectal cancer, or sarcoma.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To obtain preliminary estimates of progression-free survival at 6 months. II. To obtain preliminary estimates of the rate of 1-year overall survival. III. To obtain preliminary estimates of the response rate. IV. To obtain preliminary estimates of time to progression. V. To perform correlative sciences that provide information regarding the mechanisms of action for this combination treatment.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation and dose expansion study of ziv-aflibercept.\n\nPatients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over approximately 30 minutes and ziv-aflibercept IV over 1-2 hours on day 1. Cycles repeat every 2 weeks for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo computed tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), blood sample collection and tumor biopsy throughout the study.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for at least 12 weeks.", "eligibilityModule": {"eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* In dose escalation, patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic disease from any solid tumor (NOS 10029000).

for this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation; patients should continue contraceptive measures for 6 months from the last dose of all study medications\n* Female patients of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 24 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication; if the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required\n* Female patients of childbearing potential should be willing to use 2 methods of birth control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course of the study through 120 days after the last dose of study medication;

patients with vitiligo or resolved childhood asthma/atopy would be an exception to this rule; patients that require intermittent use of bronchodilators or local steroid injections would not be excluded from the study; patients with hypothyroidism stable on hormone replacement or Sjogren's syndrome will not be excluded from the study\n* Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the patient's participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of the patient to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator\n* Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial\n* Dose escalation and dose expansion part 1 only: Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CD137, or ziv-aflibercept (prior treatment with bevacizumab is not an exclusion criteria)\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, interstitial lung disease or active, non-infectious pneumonitis, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements\n* If pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment; pregnant women are excluded from this study because MK-3475 is an agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with MK-3475, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with MK-3475; these potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study; MK-3475 may have adverse effects on a fetus in utero; furthermore, it is not known if MK-3475 has transient adverse effects on the composition of sperm; patients are excluded from this study if pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment\n* Men and non-pregnant, non-breast-feeding women may be enrolled if they are willing to use 2 methods of birth control or are considered highly unlikely to conceive; highly unlikely to conceive is defined as 1) surgically sterilized, or 2) postmenopausal (a woman who is \\>= 45 years of age and has not had menses for greater than 2 years will be considered postmenopausal), or 3) not heterosexually active for the duration of the study; the two birth control methods can be barrier method or a barrier method plus a hormonal method to prevent pregnancy; patients should start using birth control from study visit 1 throughout the study period up to 120 days after the last dose of study therapy; the following are considered adequate barrier methods of contraception: diaphragm, condom (by the partner), copper intrauterine device, sponge, or spermicide; appropriate hormonal contraceptives will include any registered and marketed contraceptive agent that contains an estrogen and/or a progestational agent (including oral, subcutaneous, intrauterine, or intramuscular agents); patients should continue contraceptive measures for 6 months from the last dose of all study medications; patients should be informed that taking the study medication may involve unknown risks to the fetus (unborn baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the study; in order to participate in the study they must adhere to the contraception requirement (described above) for the duration of the study and during the follow-up period defined; if there is any question that a patient will not reliably comply with the requirements for contraception, that patient should not be entered into the study; pregnancy: If a patient inadvertently becomes pregnant while on treatment with MK-3475, the patient will immediately be removed from the study; the site will contact the patient at least monthly and document the patient's status until the pregnancy has been completed or terminated; the outcome of the pregnancy will be reported without delay and within 24 hours if the outcome is a serious adverse experience (e.g., death, abortion, congenital anomaly, or other disabling or life-threatening complication to the mother or newborn); the study investigator will make every effort to obtain permission to follow the outcome of the pregnancy and report the condition of the fetus or newborn; if a male patient impregnates his female partner the study personnel at the site must be informed immediately and the pregnancy reported and followed; it is unknown whether MK-3475 is excreted in human milk; since many drugs are excreted in human milk, and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the nursing infant, patients who are breast-feeding are not eligible for enrollment\n* Patients who are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive may participate IF they meet the following eligibility requirements:\n\n  * They must be stable on their anti-retroviral regimen, and they must be healthy from an HIV perspective\n  * They must have a cluster of differentiation (CD)4 count of greater than 250 cells/mcL\n  * They must not be receiving prophylactic therapy for an opportunistic infection\n* Has known active hepatitis B (e.g., hepatitis B surface antigen \\[HBsAg\\] reactive) or hepatitis C (e.g., hepatitis C virus \\[HCV\\] ribonucleic acid \\[RNA\\] \\[qualitative\\] is detected)\n* Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment\n* History within 6 months prior to treatment of myocardial infarction, severe/unstable angina pectoris, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV congestive heart failure (CHF), stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA)\n* History within 3 months prior to treatment of grade 3-4 gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding/hemorrhage, treatment resistant peptic ulcer disease, erosive esophagitis or gastritis, infectious or inflammatory bowel disease, diverticulitis, pulmonary embolus, or other uncontrolled thromboembolic event\n* Patients who are less than 4 weeks post-operative (op) after major surgery", "healthyVolunteers": false, "sex": "ALL", "minimumAge": "18 Years", "stdAges": ["ADULT", "OLDER_ADULT"]}}
