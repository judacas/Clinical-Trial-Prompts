Data Models for Logical Structured Clinical Trial Criteria

This module defines the Pydantic models used to represent the logical relationships
between atomic criteria extracted from clinical trial eligibility criteria.

Classes prefixed with 'LLM' are used as output formats for LLM processing, while
other classes are used for internal data storage.

Classes:
    LLMLogicalAnd: Logical AND relationship between criteria.
    LLMLogicalOr: Logical OR relationship between criteria.
    LLMLogicalNot: Logical NOT operation on criteria.
    LLMLogicalXor: Logical XOR relationship between criteria.
    LLMLogicalConditional: Conditional (if-then-else) relationship.
    LLMLogicalWrapperResponse: Container for LLM logical structure response.
    LogicalLine: Line with identified criteria and logical structure.
    LogicalTrial: Complete trial with logically structured criteria.

Important:
    The docstrings of Pydantic models are used as prompts for LLM processing.
    Changing these docstrings will alter how the LLM interprets the output format.
    Use code comments rather than docstring modifications if documentation changes
    are needed without affecting LLM behavior.
