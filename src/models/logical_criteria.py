"""
This file defines the pydantic models used in the logical structurization process to represent the logical structure between the atomic criteria extracted from the identification process.

All of the classes below which start with LLM are used as the output format for the LLM, the rest are how we end up storing the data internally.

Classes:
    LLMLogicalAnd: Represents a logical AND relationship between criteria.
    LLMLogicalOr: Represents a logical OR relationship between criteria.
    LLMLogicalNot: Represents a logical NOT operation on a criterion or logical expression.
    LLMLogicalXor: Represents a logical XOR relationship between criteria.
    LLmLogicalConditional: Represents a conditional (if then else) relationship between criteria.
    LLMLogicalWrapperResponse: Represents the response from the LLM with the logical structure.
    LogicalLine: Represents a line of eligibility criteria that has been logically structured.
    LogicalTrial: Represents a trial with logically structured criteria.

Notes:
    - If you change the docstring of the Pydantic models below, you will be changing the "prompt" to the LLMs since the descriptions are used when the LLM reads the output format. Add comments instead if needed.
    - The LogicalLine model includes both the identified line and its logical structure and is the core of our logical structurization process.
    - The LogicalTrial model includes lists of successfully structurized lines and lines that failed to be structurized and is the end result of our logical structurization process.
