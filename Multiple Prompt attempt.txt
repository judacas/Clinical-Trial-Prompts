Notes:

Are your bone marrow, renal and hepatic functions within the acceptable ranges as specified in the trial eligibility criteria?

question tries to have reader read the eligibility criteria. need to make it clear that the user will not have access to this criteria and it must relist it.

no mention of not having organ allograft transplantation

mentions not having bleeding or coagulopathy diseases but not anemia

mentions not taking autoimmune suppressive therapy but does not mention not having an autoimmune disease
