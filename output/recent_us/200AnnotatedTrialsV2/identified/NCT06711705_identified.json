Measurable disease as defined by any of the following:\n\n   1. Serum M-protein level ≥ 0.5 g/dL by serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP), or\n   2. Urine M-protein ≥ 200mg/24 hours by urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP), or\n   3.

All other female patients (including female patients with tubal ligations) are considered to be of childbearing potential.\n13.

Active malignancy other than Multiple Myeloma requiring treatment in the past 3 years, with the exception of successfully treated non-metastatic squamous or basal skin carcinoma\n4. Known CNS involvement by multiple myeloma\n5. Active, uncontrolled autoimmune disorders\n6. Active uncontrolled infection. Active infections must be resolved and/or controlled at least 14 days prior to enrollment.\n7. Radiation therapy within 2 weeks prior to study entry (bone lesions requiring radiation may be treated with limited [ie, ≤25% of bone marrow in field] radiation therapy during this period).\n8. Last systemic treatment within 2 weeks or 5 half lives, whichever is shorter. Subjects can receive a maximum of 160mg of dexamethasone or equivalent during screening, but at least 7 days prior to start of therapy.\n9. Last radiation treatment to multiple sites within 2 weeks and single site within 1 week\n10. History of autologous stem cell transplant within 100 days prior to study enrollment.\n11. History of allogeneic transplant within 1 year prior to study enrollment or active graft versus host disease.\n12. On immunosuppressive therapy for concurrent comorbid conditions\n13. Other major uncontrolled medical comorbidities that may put patients at risk of serious adverse event with treatment with study medication.\n14. Clinically significant, uncontrolled cardiac disease\n15. Grade ≥2 peripheral sensory or motor neuropathy\n16. History of Guillan-Barre syndrome\n17. Other surgical (including major surgery within 14 days prior to enrollment) or psychiatric conditions including recent (within the past year) or active suicidal ideation/behavior or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk of study participation or, in the investigator's judgment, make the participant inappropriate for the study.\n18. Previous administration with an investigational drug within 30 days (or as determined by the local requirement) or 5 half-lives preceding the first dose of study intervention used in this study (whichever is longer).\n19.
