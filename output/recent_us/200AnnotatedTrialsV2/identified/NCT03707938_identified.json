        "exclusion_criteria": "1. Have been diagnosed with another primary malignancy other than NSCLC, except for adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer or cervical cancer in situ; definitively treated non-metastatic prostate cancer; or patients with another primary malignancy who are definitively relapse-free with at least 2 years elapsed since the diagnosis of the other primary malignancy.\n2. Previously received any prior TKI, including ALK-targeted TKIs. Note: on-going first-line brigatinib use as specified in the Inclusion criteria is allowed.\n3. Previously received more than 1 regimen of chemotherapy or immunotherapy for locally advanced or metastatic disease. Note that history of consolidative immunotherapy after concurrent chemoradiotherapy (for locally advanced disease) is allowed.\n4. Symptomatic CNS metastasis. Asymptomatic CNS disease requiring increasing dose of corticosteroids within 7 days prior to study enrollment is also not permitted.\n5. Have current spinal cord compression (symptomatic or asymptomatic and detected by radiographic imaging). Patients with leptomeningeal disease and without cord compression are allowed.\n6. The presence of pulmonary interstitial disease, drug-related pneumonitis, or radiation pneumonitis at screening.\n7. Have a known or suspected hypersensitivity to brigatinib or its excipients.\n8. Have malabsorption syndrome or other gastrointestinal (GI) illness or condition that could affect oral absorption of the study drug.\n9. Be pregnant, planning a pregnancy, or breastfeeding.\n10. Have significant, uncontrolled, or active cardiovascular disease, specifically including, but not restricted to:\n\n    1. Myocardial infarction (MI) within 6 months prior to the first dose of study drug\n    2. Unstable angina within 6 months prior to first dose of study drug\n    3. Decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF) within 6 months prior to first dose of study drug\n    4. History of clinically significant atrial arrhythmia (including clinically significant bradyarrhythmia), as determined by the treating physician\n    5. Any history of ventricular arrhythmia\n    6. Cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack within 6 months prior to first dose of study drug\n11. Have uncontrolled hypertension. Patients with hypertension should be under treatment on study entry to control blood pressure\n12. Have an ongoing or active infection, including, but not limited to, the requirement for intravenous (IV) antibiotics.\n13. Have a known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Testing is not required in the absence of history.\n14.
