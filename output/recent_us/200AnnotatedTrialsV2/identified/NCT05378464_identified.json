Note: HER2 positive breast cancer is defined by tumor tissue HER2 overexpression and or tumor HER2 amplification per ASCO/CAP criteria.\n* Patients will be eligible regardless of ER/PR status which will be determined per 2020 ASCO/CAP guideline and hormonal therapy will be allowed to continue for patients with ER/PR positive disease.\n* Must have evaluable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured ≥ 10 mm by standard imaging techniques that can be include but not limited to CT, PET, PET/CT, MRI. Skeletal disease which is measurable by PET/CT or bone scan will also be allowed.\n* Must have had disease progression while on trastuzumab for the treatment of HER2+ MBC and received no more than 3 lines of cytotoxic chemotherapy in the setting of metastatic disease.\n* ECOG performance status 0 or 1.\n* Must have normal organ and marrow function as defined in protocol within 14 days of registration.\n* Left ventricular ejection fraction above institutional lower limit of normal (by echocardiogram or MUGA scan)\n* Female patients of childbearing potential must agree to use dual methods of contraception and have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test at screening, and male patients must use an effective barrier method of contraception if sexually active with a female of child-bearing potential. Acceptable methods of contraception are condoms with contraceptive foam, oral, implantable or injectable contraceptives, contraceptive patch, intrauterine device, diaphragm with spermicidal gel, or a sexual partner who is surgically sterilized or post-menopausal. For both male and female patients, effective methods of contraception must be used throughout the study and for 3 months following the last dose. To be considered of not to be of childbearing potential, postmenopausal women must be amenorrheic for at least 12 months naturally (not in the setting of post chemotherapy) or patients must be surgically sterile.\n* Must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent prior to registration on study.\n* Must have a life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
