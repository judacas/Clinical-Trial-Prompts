Must have progressed on at least 1 line of prior therapy in the locally advanced/metastatic setting. Note: multiple lines of TKI for the same actionable mutation count as 1 line of therapy. Maintenance therapy is not considered a separate line of therapy. Adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapies count as 1 line of therapy if given within 6 months before study entry.\n4. Subjects without any actionable gene alteration: must have progressed on (or be considered ineligible for), or be intolerant to, platinum-based chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitor (as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy).\n5. Subjects with actionable gene alterations (other than EGFR) for which immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy is not standard of care (e.g., anaplastic lymphoma kinase [ALK] translocation): must have progressed on (or be considered ineligible for), or be intolerant to, anticancer therapy targeting driver gene alterations and platinum-based chemotherapy.\n6. Subjects with actionable gene alterations (other than EGFR) for which immune checkpoint inhibitor is standard of care: must have progressed on (or be considered ineligible for), or be intolerant to, anticancer therapy targeting driver gene alteration and platinum-based chemotherapy, and also progressed on (or be considered ineligible for) or be intolerant to immune checkpoint\n\nAll patients (Part 1 and Part 2)\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patient has at least one measurable lesion per RECIST 1.1\n* ECOG performance status 0 or 1\n* For women of childbearing potential and men with partners of childbearing potential, agreement to use a highly effective method of birth control for the duration of the study treatment and for at least 6 months after the last dose of study drug.\n* Able to provide informed consent, and willing and able to comply with study protocol requirements\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",

A history of prior radiation pneumonitis in the radiation field (fibrosis) is permitted.\n* Clinically significant systemic illness that could pose undue risk to the subject or confound the ability to interpret study results.\n* Active infection requiring IV antibiotics, antivirals, or antifungal medication within 14 Days of Cycle 1 Day 1\n* Neuropathy > Grade 1\n* History of cirrhosis, hepatic fibrosis, esophageal or gastric varices, or other clinically significant liver disease.\n* Active or chronic corneal disorder\n* Conditions that may interfere with assessment of vision, such as monocular status or severe visual impairment in 1 or both eyes",
