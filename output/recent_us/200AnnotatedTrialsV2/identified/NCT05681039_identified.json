        "inclusion_criteria": "* Signed Informed Consent Form\n* Age 18 years at time of signing Informed Consent Form\n* Ability to comply with the study protocol, in the investigator's judgment\n* Histologically or cytologically confirmed, newly diagnosed, OCSCC that is clinical AJCC 8th edition Stage 3-4 (T1-T4N1-3, T3-T4N0)\n* Patients with a history of previously resected stage T1N0 or T2N0 OCSCC and no prior history of radiotherapy to the head and neck are eligible at local +/- regional recurrence if they otherwise meet stage criteria.\n* Surgically resectable OCSCC as determined by the patients' treating head and neck surgeon. Patients with a clinical diagnosis of oral cavity cancer, awaiting a biopsy are eligible to consent for pre-screening.\n* Measurable disease per RECIST v1.1\n* PD-L1 CPS≥ 1 (determined by immunohistochemistry with the 22C3 antibody) as documented through testing of a representative tumor tissue specimen\n* Availability of a representative tumor specimen for exploratory biomarker research (see Appendix 12 for information on tumor specimens) A formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor specimen in a paraffin block (preferred) or at least 15 slides containing unstained, freshly cut, serial sections must be available for baseline biomarker analysis along with an associated pathology report prior to study enrollment. If archival tumor tissue is unavailable or is determined to be unsuitable for, tumor tissue must be obtained from a biopsy performed at screening.\n* ECOG Performance Status of 0-1\n* Adequate hematologic and end-organ function, defined by the following laboratory test results, obtained within 14 days prior to initiation of study treatment:\n\n  * ANC 1.5 109/L (1500/L) without granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support\n  * Lymphocyte count 0.5 109/L (500/L)\n  * Platelet count 100 109/L (100,000/L) without transfusion\n  * Hemoglobin 90 g/L (9 g/dL) Patients may be transfused to meet this criterion.\n  * AST, ALT, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 2.5 upper limit of normal (ULN)\n  * Serum bilirubin 1.5 ULN with the following exception:\n\nPatients with known Gilbert disease: serum bilirubin 3 ULN\n\n* Creatinine clearance 50 mL/min (calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault formula)\n* Serum albumin 25 g/L (2.5 g/dL)\n* For patients not receiving therapeutic anticoagulation: INR and aPTT 1.5 xULN\n\n  * For patients receiving therapeutic anticoagulation: stable anticoagulant regimen\n  * Negative HIV test at screening, with the following exception: patients with a positive HIV test at screening are eligible provided they are stable on anti-retroviral therapy for ≥3 months, have a CD4 count 200/µL, and have an undetectable viral load\n  * Negative hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) test at screening\n  * Positive hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb) test at screening, or negative HBsAb at screening accompanied by either of the following:\n* Negative total hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb)\n* Positive total HBcAb test followed by quantitative hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA < 500 IU/mL The HBV DNA test will be performed only for patients who have a negative HBsAg test, a negative HBsAb test, and a positive total HBcAb test.\n\n  * Negative hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody test at screening, or positive HCV antibody test followed by a negative HCV RNA test at screening. The HCV RNA test will be performed only for patients who have a positive HCV antibody test.\n  * Requirements for contraception and pregnancy testing for a clinical trial should encompass all investigational medicinal products (IMPs) as well as protocol-mandated non-investigational medicinal products (NIMPs) such as background therapy, and the measures to be followed should be based on the medicinal product with the highest risk (see the protocol synopsis for definition of IMP and NIMP). Contraception requirements for marketed Genentech IMPs or NIMPs should be based on recommendations in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) or, if there is no SmPC, national prescribing information. Contraception requirements for unapproved Genentech IMPs or NIMPs should be based on recommendations in the Investigator Brochure (IB).\n* For women of childbearing potential: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive methods, and agreement to refrain from donating eggs, as defined below:\n\nWomen must remain abstinent or use contraceptive methods with a failure rate of 1% per year during the treatment period and for 5 months after the final dose of atezolizumab, 90 days after the last dose of tiragolimab and for 6 months after the final dose of carboplatin or cisplatin. Women must refrain from donating eggs during this same period.\n\nA woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarchal, has not reached a postmenopausal state ( 12 continuous months of amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone surgical sterilization (removal of ovaries and/or uterus). The definition of childbearing potential may be adapted for alignment with local guidelines or requirements.\n\nExamples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of 1% per year include bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, hormonal contraceptives that inhibit ovulation, hormone-releasing intrauterine devices, and copper intrauterine devices.\n\nThe reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not adequate methods of contraception.\n\n- For men: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive measures, and agreement to refrain from donating sperm, as defined below: With a female partner of childbearing potential who is not pregnant, men who are not surgically sterile must remain abstinent or use a condom plus an additional contraceptive method that together result in a failure rate of 1% per year during the treatment period, for 90 days (a sperm cycle) after the final dose of tiragolumab and for 6 months after the final dose of carboplatin or cisplatin. Men must refrain from donating sperm during this same period.\n\nWith a pregnant female partner, men must remain abstinent or use a condom during the treatment period, for 90 days after the final dose of tiragolumab and for 6 months after the final dose of carboplatin or cisplatin to avoid exposing the embryo.\n\nThe reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not adequate methods of contraception.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
