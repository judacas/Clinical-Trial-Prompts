For escalation part: patients with histologically confirmed solid tumors who have progressed on or are intolerant of standard therapy or for whom no standard therapy exists.\n\nFor expansion Part:\n\n1. Patients with histologically confirmed urothelial carcinoma or cholangiocarcinoma who have progressed on or are intolerant of standard therapy or for whom no standard therapy exists.\n2. Patients must have tumors with following FGFR2/3 genetic alterations based on central laboratory test or existing test reports: Urothelial carcinoma: FGFR2/3 fusions and FGFR3 activating mutations Cholangiocarcinoma: FGFR2 fusions and/or arrangements\n3. Patients must have at least one measurable target lesion according to RECIST 1.1.\n4.

Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or active hepatitis B, or active hepatitis C infection; positive tests for hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg), or antibody to hepatitis B core Ag (HBcAb), or hepatitis C RNA in serum (subjects with history of hepatitis C infection but negative hepatitis C virus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test are allowed; positive tests for HBV HBsAg or HBcAb with HBV-DNA measurements lower than 1000IU/ml can be included)\n12. Any of the following ophthalmological criteria:\n\n    * Current evidence or previous history of retinal pigmented epithelial detachment (RPED)\n    * Previous laser treatment or intra-ocular injection for treatment of macular degeneration\n    * Current evidence or previous history of dry or wet age-related macular degeneration\n    * Current evidence or previous history of retinal vein occlusion (RVO)\n    * Current evidence or previous history of retinal degenerative diseases (eg, hereditary)\n    * Current evidence or previous history of any other clinically relevant chorioretinal defect\n    * Current evidence or previous history of corneal pathology such as conjunctivitis, keratopathy, corneal abrasion or ulceration\n13. Patients with refractory/uncontrolled ascites or pleural effusion.\n14. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a positive human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) laboratory test within 7 days prior to the start of study drug.\n15. Non-surgically sterilized male or female patients of childbearing potential must agree to use highly effective methods of birth control during the study and for up to 6 months after the last dose of study drug.\n16. Sexually active males, unless they use a condom during intercourse while taking drug and for 5 consecutive compound half-lives plus 60 days after stopping study drug, should not father a child. A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men to prevent delivery of the drug via seminal fluid.\n17. Vaccination with a live, attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks of the first dose of study treatment and while on trial is prohibited except for administration of inactivate vaccines (e.g., COVID-19 vaccines, inactivated influenza vaccines).\n18. Any other clinically significant comorbidities, such as uncontrolled pulmonary disease, active infection, or any other condition, which in the judgment of the Investigator, could compromise compliance with the protocol, interfere with the interpretation of study results, or predispose the patient to safety risks.",
