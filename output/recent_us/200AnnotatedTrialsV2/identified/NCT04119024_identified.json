Radiological documentation of absence of active brain metastases at screening is required for all patients. Prior evidence of brain metastasis successfully treated with surgery or radiation therapy will not be exclusion for participation as long as they are deemed under control at the time of study enrollment\n* Potential requirement for systemic corticosteroids or concurrent immunosuppressive drugs based on prior history or received systemic steroids within the last 2 weeks prior to enrollment; not including patients with primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency who require physiologic replacement with steroids, or patients on inhaled or topical steroids at standard doses\n* Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositivity or other congenital or acquired immune deficiency state, which would increase the risk of opportunistic infections and other complications during chemotherapy-induced lymphodepletion. If there is a positive result in the infectious disease testing that was not previously known, the patient will be referred to their primary physician and/or infectious disease specialist\n* Hepatitis B or C seropositivity with evidence of ongoing liver damage, which would increase the likelihood of hepatic toxicities from the chemotherapy conditioning regimen and supportive treatments. If there is a positive result in the infectious disease testing that was not previously known, the patient will be referred to their primary physician and/or infectious disease specialist\n* Dementia or significantly altered mental status that would prohibit the understanding or rendering of informed consent and compliance with the requirements of this protocol\n* A Tiffeneau-Pinelli index < 70% of the predicted value. Subjects will be excluded if pulmonary function tests indicate they have insufficient pulmonary capability\n* Patients will be excluded if they have a history of clinically significant electrocardiography (ECG) abnormalities, symptoms of cardiac ischemia or arrhythmias and have a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 45% on a cardiac stress test (stress thallium, stress multigated acquisition scan (MUGA), dobutamine echocardiogram, or other stress test)\n* Patients with ECG results of any conduction delays (PR interval > 200 ms, corrected QT (QTC) > 480 ms), sinus bradycardia (resting heart rate < 50 beats per minute), sinus tachycardia (HR > 120 beats per minute) will be evaluated by a cardiologist prior to starting the trial. Patients with any arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter, excessive ectopy (defined as > 20 ventricular premature complex [PVC]s per minute), ventricular tachycardia, 3rd degree heart block will be excluded from the study unless cleared by a cardiologist\n* Pregnancy or breast-feeding. Female patients must be surgically sterile or be postmenopausal for two years, or must agree to use effective contraception during the period of treatment and for 6 months afterwards. All female patients with reproductive potential must have a negative pregnancy test (serum/urine) at screening and again within 14 days from starting the conditioning chemotherapy. The definition of effective contraception will be based on the judgment of the study investigators. Patients who are breastfeeding are not allowed on this study\n* A concomitant active malignancy that would be considered to interfere with the assessment of the primary or secondary endpoints of the study",
