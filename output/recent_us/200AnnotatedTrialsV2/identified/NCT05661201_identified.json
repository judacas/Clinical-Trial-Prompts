Subjects on anticoagulation (such as warfarin) will be permitted to enroll as long as the INR is in the acceptable therapeutic range as determined by the investigator\n* Patients must have fully recovered from all effects of surgery. Patients must have had at least two weeks after minor surgery and four weeks after major surgery before starting therapy. Minor procedures requiring \"twilight\" sedation such as endoscopies or mediport placement may only require a 24-hour waiting period, but this must be discussed with an investigator\n* Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 14 days prior to initiation of treatment and/or postmenopausal women must be amenorrheic for at least 12 months to be considered of non-childbearing potential\n* Patient is capable of understanding and complying with parameters as outlined in the protocol and able to sign and date the informed consent, approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB), prior to the initiation of any screening or study-specific procedures\n* Have measurable disease by RECIST v. 1.1\n* Have disease amenable to serial core tumor biopsies\n* Suitable, stable venous access to allow for all study-related blood sampling (a central line such as a portacath (e.g. Medi-Port) or PICC is highly encouraged)\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",

Risk factors for Torsades de Pointe (TdP) including uncorrected hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, history of cardiac failure, or history of clinically significant/symptomatic bradycardia.\n    2. Concomitant use of medication(s) with a known risk to prolong the QT interval and/or known to cause Torsades de Pointe that cannot be discontinued (within 5 half-lives or 7 days prior to starting study drug) or replaced by safe alternative medication\n    3. Inability to determine the QT interval on screening (QTcF, using Fridericia's correction)\n  * Systolic blood pressure (SBP) >160 mmHg or <90 mmHg at screening",
