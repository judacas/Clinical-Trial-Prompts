There will be 2 other optional biopsies that the patient will be asked to consent to, the first is durking week 2 of pembrolizumab/ISA101b vaccination (prior to start of cisplatin-IMRT-this correlates to week (-)1), the second once will be during week 2 after the start of IMRT (this correlates to week 1).\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status 0-1\n* Age ≥ 18\n* Patients must have measurable disease according to RECIST 1.1\n* Patients must demonstrate adequate organ function\n* Written informed consent must be obtained from all patients prior to study registration.\n* Documentation of negative pregnancy within 10 days of treatment initiation.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
        "exclusion_criteria": "* Oral Cavity, Larynx, Hypopharynx or Nasopharyngeal primary site\n* Current participation in or previous participation in a study of an investigational agent or using an investigational device within 4 weeks of the first dose of study treatment.\n* Prior treatment with anti-HPV agents except prevention HPV vaccines\n* History of severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions or hypersensitivity to recombinant proteins or excipients in the investigational agents (pembrolizumab and ISA101b\n* Distant metastatic disease including CNS or leptomeningeal metastases is not allowed.\n* Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).\n* Received prior monoclonal antibody within 4 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e. ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.\n* History of second malignancy within 2 years prior to Study Day 1 (except for excised and cured non-melanoma skin cancer, carcinoma in situ of breast or cervix, superficial bladder cancer, or T1a or T1b prostate cancer comprising < 5% of resected tissue with normal prostate specific antigen (PSA) since resection).\n* Active autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment within the past 3 months or a documented history of clinically severe autoimmune disease, or a syndrome that requires systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents.\n* Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).\n* Known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA [qualitative] is detected).\n* Received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CD137, or anti-Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) antibody (including ipilimumab or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation or checkpoint pathways).\n* Significant pulmonary disease including pulmonary hypertension, history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids, evidence of interstitial lung disease or active, non-infectious pneumonitis\n* History or current evidence of any other medical or psychiatric condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality not in the best interest of the trial or subject to participate, per the treating investigator.\n* Peripheral neuropathy ≥ Grade 2\n* Significant cardiovascular disease.\n* Significant thrombotic or embolic events within 3 months prior to Study Day 1.\n* Major surgery within 6 weeks prior to Study Day 1 (subjects must have completely recovered from any previous surgery prior to Study Day 1). Biopsy, diagnostic tonsillectomy, airway tumor debulking or excisional lymph node biopsy do not constitute major surgery.\n* Active infection requiring antibiotics or antifungals within 7 days prior to first dose of study drug.\n* Significant electrolyte imbalance prior to enrollment (note that patients may be supplemented to achieve acceptable electrolyte values):\n* Pregnant or breastfeeding (due to potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects).",
