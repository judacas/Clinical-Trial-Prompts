Uncontrolled and/or active systemic infection (viral, bacterial or fungal)\n  2. Acute/Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C (HCV) requiring treatment. Note: subjects with serologic evidence of prior vaccination to HBV (i.e. hepatitis B surface (HBs) antigen negative-, anti-HBs antibody positive and anti-hepatitis B core (HBc) antibody negative) or positive anti-HBc antibody from intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) or resolved HBV infection may participate. 6. Systemic chronic corticosteroid therapy (≥10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent) or any immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days of first dose of study treatment. Topical, inhaled, nasal and ophthalmic steroids are allowed. 7. For initial enrolment to INTERCEPT therapy, patients who have received previous TIM3 inhibitor treatment are excluded. This exclusion criteria does not apply to patients crossing-over from MBG453 arm to the combination MBG453 + azacitidine arm, unless MBG453 was ceased due to MBG453-related toxicity. 8. Patients with active, known or suspected autoimmune disease. Patients with vitiligo, type I diabetes, residual hypothyroidism only requiring hormone replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment or conditions not expected to recur should not be excluded 9.
