Must agree to not use during study treatment through the end of treatment visit to be eligible.\n* Known autoimmune disease requiring active treatment. Persons with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (> 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of enrollment. Inhaled or topical steroids, and adrenal replacement steroid doses ≤ 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent, are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease.\n* Active systemic infection requiring parenteral antibiotic therapy. All prior infections must have resolved following optimal therapy.\n* Prior organ allograft or allogeneic transplantation.\n* Known HIV-positive or AIDS.\n* Psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* Other illness or a medical issue that in the opinion of the Investigator would exclude the subject from participating in this study",
