Any GVHD treatment (including calcineurin inhibitors) must be discontinued at least 28 days prior to Day 1 of study treatment.\n* Systemic treatment with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor or a strong CYP450 inducer within 14 days prior to treatment Day 1 (see Appendix 13.7 and 13.8 for a list of CYP3A4 inhibitors and CYP450 inducers, respectively). Shorter washout periods may be permitted with approval of the Study Chair, provided that the washout period is at least five half-lives of the drug prior to treatment Day 1.\n* Other invasive malignancies within the last 3 years, except curatively treated non-melanoma skin cancer, localized prostate, cervical cancer, and any curatively treated carcinoma in situ.\n* Presence of active serious infection.\n\n  * If a patient is identified to have COVID-19 during the screening period, participants may be considered eligible if in the opinion of the investigator there are no COVID-19 sequlae that may place the patient at a higher risk of receiving investigational treatment.\n* Any serious, unstable medical or psychiatric condition that would prevent, (as judged by the Investigator) the patient from signing the informed consent form or any condition, including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which places the patient at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study or confounds the ability to interpret data from the study.\n* Known history of uncontrolled human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).\n* Significant recent bleeding history defined as NCI CTCAE grade ≥2 within 3 months prior to treatment Day 1, unless precipitated by an inciting event (e.g., surgery, trauma, or injury).\n* Systemic treatment with medications that increase the risk of bleeding, including anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents (except for aspirin dosages of ≤100 mg per day), anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents, and daily use of COX-1 inhibiting Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) within 14 days prior to treatment Day 1.\n* Any history of CTCAE grade ≥2 cardiac conditions within 6 months prior to treatment Day 1. Patients with asymptomatic grade 2 non-dysrhythmia cardiovascular conditions may be considered for inclusion, with the approval of the Study Chair, if stable and unlikely to affect patient safety.\n* Heart failure other than NYHA class I (asymptomatic, without limitation).\n* QT corrected by the Fridericia method (QTcF) prolongation >480 ms or other factors that increase the risk for QT interval prolongation (e.g., hypokalemia [defined as serum potassium <3.0 mEq/L that is persistent and refractory to correction], or history of long QT interval syndrome).\n* Known active systemic hepatitis B, or C infection requiring therapy or known cirrhosis.\n* Is or has an immediate family member (e.g., spouse, parent/legal guardian, sibling, or child) who is investigational site or pharmaceutical sponsor staff directly involved with this trial, unless prospective IRB approval (by chair or designee) is given allowing exception to this criterion for a specific participant.\n* Organ transplant recipients other than bone marrow transplant.\n* Women who are pregnant or lactating.\n* Patient with known gastrointestinal (GI) disease or prior GI procedure that could interfere with the oral absorption or tolerance of pacritinib, including difficulty swallowing, are not eligible.",
