A participant who receives a neoadjuvant or adjuvant platinum-containing regimen following cystectomy for localized muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma is acceptable (without further systemic treatment), if recurrence/progression occurs â‰¤ 12 months following completion of therapy.\n* Measurable disease based on RECIST v1.1.\n* Have provided an archival tumor tissue sample or newly obtained core or excisional biopsy of a tumor lesion not previously irradiated for PD-L1 analysis.\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.\n* Adequate organ function per protocol-defined criteria.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",

Participants with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are radiologically stable, ie, without evidence of progression for at least 4 weeks by repeat imaging.\n* Active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in past 2 years.\n* Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. HIV testing is not required unless mandated by local health authority.\n* Known history of or is positive for active hepatitis B (HBsAg reactive) or has active hepatitis C (HCV RNA).
