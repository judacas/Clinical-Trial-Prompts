        "exclusion_criteria": "* Pregnant or breastfeeding.\n* History of clinically significant vascular disease, including any of the following within 6 months prior to start of study treatment: MI or unstable angina, percutaneous coronary intervention, bypass grafting, ventricular arrhythmia requiring medication, stroke or transient ischemic attack, symptomatic peripheral arterial disease.\n* Marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval (e.g., demonstration of a QTc interval greater or equal to 470 milliseconds by Fridericia's correction).\n* Known or suspected untreated CNS metastases.\n* Anti-cancer treatment including surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, other immunotherapy, or investigational therapy within 14 days before treatment start.\n* Other prior malignancy except for the following: adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, adequately treated Stage I or II cancer from which the subject is currently in complete remission, or any other cancer from which the subject has been disease-free for 3 years after surgical treatment.\n* Known hypersensitivity or history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to the agents used in the study.\n* Prior therapy with TGF-β antagonist, IL-15 or analogs.\n* Concurrent use of St. John's wort and and/or other herbal CYP modulators within 7 days of Day 1. Must agree to not use during study treatment through the end of treatment visit to be eligible.\n* Known autoimmune disease requiring active treatment. Persons with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (> 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of enrollment. Inhaled or topical steroids, and adrenal replacement steroid doses ≤ 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent, are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease.\n* Active systemic infection requiring parenteral antibiotic therapy. All prior infections must have resolved following optimal therapy.\n* Prior organ allograft or allogeneic transplantation.\n* Known HIV-positive or AIDS.\n* Psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* Other illness or a medical issue that in the opinion of the Investigator would exclude the subject from participating in this study",
