Male participants are eligible to participate if they agree to the following during the intervention period and until 6 months after the last dose of study intervention to allow for clearance of any altered sperm: Refrain from donating sperm PLUS, either: Be abstinent from heterosexual intercourse as their preferred and usual lifestyle (abstinent on a long term and persistent basis) and agree to remain abstinent OR Must agree to use contraception/barrier as detailed below depending on whether they are randomised to Arm 1 (belantamab mafodotin) or Arm 2 (pom/dex), even if they have undergone a successful vasectomy: Agree to use a male condom throughout study treatment including the 6 month follow-up period even if they have undergone a successful vasectomy and a female partner to use an additional highly effective contraceptive method with a failure rate of <1 percent per year when having sexual intercourse with a pregnant woman or a woman of childbearing potential who is not currently pregnant. Four weeks for male participants on Treatment Arm 2 (pom/dex).\n* A female participant is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant or breastfeeding, and at least one of the following conditions applies: Is not a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) OR Is a WOCBP and agrees to abide by the following: Arm 1 (belantamab mafodotin): Use a contraceptive method that is highly effective (with a failure rate of <1 percent per year) which includes abstinence, preferably with low user dependency during the intervention period and for 4 months after the last dose of study treatment. Arm 2 (pom/dex): Due to pomalidomide being a thalidomide analogue with risk for embryofetal toxicity and prescribed under a pregnancy prevention/controlled distribution program, WOCBP participants will be eligible if they commit either to abstain continuously from heterosexual sexual intercourse or to use two methods of reliable birth control (one method that is highly effective), beginning 4 weeks prior to initiating treatment with pomalidomide, during therapy, during dose interruptions and continuing for at least 4 weeks following discontinuation of pomalidomide treatment. Two negative pregnancy tests must be obtained prior to initiating therapy. The first test should be performed within 10-14 days and the second test within 24 hours prior to prescribing pomalidomide therapy. And agrees not to donate eggs (ova, oocytes) for the purpose of reproduction during this period. The investigator should confirm the effectiveness of the contraceptive method(s) ahead of the first dose of study intervention.\n* All prior treatment-related toxicities (defined by National Cancer Institute- Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events [NCI-CTCAE], version 5.0, 2017) must be <=Grade 1 at the time of enrollment, except for alopecia and Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
