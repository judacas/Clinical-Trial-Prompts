Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not adequate methods of contraception.\n\n* For men: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive measures, and agreement to refrain from donating sperm, as defined below:\n* With a female partner of childbearing potential who is not pregnant, or a pregnant female partner men who are not surgically sterile must remain abstinent or use a condom plus an additional contraceptive method that together result in a failure rate of < 1% per year during the treatment period and for 8 months after the final dose of atezolizumab and 120 days after the final dose of etoposide. Men must refrain from donating sperm during this same period.\n* The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not adequate methods of contraception.\n* Patients who give a written informed consent obtained according to local guidelines\n* Patients who received mineralocorticoids (e.g., fludrocortisone), corticosteroids for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma, or low-dose corticosteroids for orthostatic hypotension or adrenal insufficiency are eligible for the study.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",

Individual cases will be discussed at investigator discretion.\n* Patients with another active second malignancy other than non-melanoma skin cancers and biochemical relapsed prostate cancer.
