Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and biphenotypic AML are not eligible\n* Patients must have MRD-level disease only and otherwise meet criteria for complete response (CR) or complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) per the 2017 European Leukemia Net response criteria (< 5% blasts in the marrow without a requirement for peripheral blood count recovery). MRD must be measurable by multiparameter flow cytometry (MPFC) and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based molecular markers and/or karyotypic markers (e.g., classical cytogenetics or fluorescence in situ hybridization). MRD status will be centrally confirmed by the UW/FHCRC clinical laboratory in order to standardize response assessment following administration of study therapy.\n* Patients must have received at least 1 cycle of standard induction chemotherapy prior to enrollment on the study. However, adult patients (>= 18 years of age) are eligible for participation at any time point in treatment (after induction, during or after consolidation, pre-transplant, or post-transplant).\n* Age >= 18 years of age\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =< 3\n* Patient's AML blasts must have CD33 expression.\n* For adults (>= 18 years of age): Serum creatinine =< 2.0 mg/dL.\n* For adults (>= 18 years of age): Total bilirubin =< 2 x institutional upper limit of normal for age (unless known history of Gilbert's disease).\n* For adults (>= 18 years of age): Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) < 2.5 x institutional upper limit of normal for age (unless thought to be related to resolving infectious complications).\n* Ability of patient to provide written informed consent.\n* Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test prior to receiving GO.\n* Patients who re-enroll must have achieved an MRD-negative CR during their prior enrollment\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
