Written informed consent obtained to participate in the study and HIPAA authorization for release of personal health information.\n3. Subject is willing and able to comply with study procedures based on the judgment of the investigator or protocol designee. The subject must be willing to consent to a mandatory pre-study biopsy unless sufficient archival tissue is available.\n4. Biopsy confirmed American Joint Committee on Cancer 8th Edition35 stage III-IV B oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), p16-negative oropharyngeal SCC, stage III-IVB hypopharyngeal SCC, stage III-IVB laryngeal SCC -OR- HPV-associated oropharyngeal SCC (p16 positive or HPV-associated) T4 or N3 , T1-3 N2 or T3N0-1 with >10 pack-year tobacco history\n5. At least one lesion (measurable and/or non-measurable) that can be accurately assessed at baseline by imaging (CT/ PET) and is suitable for repeated assessment.\n6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1\n7. No prior curative attempts for this cancer (i.e., surgery, radiation, systemic therapy) and not currently participating in or has participated in a study of an investigational agent or has used an investigational device within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of the study intervention. No evidence of metastatic disease (M0)\n\nExclusion Criteria\n\n1. Subjects with prior and concurrent malignancies of different tumor types whose natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the study drug are eligible with the following exception: Subjects with prior history of HNSCC treated < 3 years to the date of consent.\n2. Cisplatin-ineligible as defined in the protocol.\n3. Severe, active medical comorbidity. Subjects are considered a poor medical risk due to a serious, uncontrolled medical disorder, non-malignant systemic disease, or active, uncontrolled infection. Examples include, but are not limited to, uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia, recent (within 3 months) myocardial infarction, uncontrolled major seizure disorder, unstable spinal cord compression, superior vena cava syndrome, extensive interstitial bilateral lung disease on High Resolution Computed Tomography scan or any psychiatric disorder that prohibits obtaining informed consent.\n4. Subjects unable to swallow orally administered medication prior to initiation of study treatment.\n5. Systemic glucocorticoids for any purpose other than to modulate symptoms from an event of clinical interest of suspected immunologic etiology\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
