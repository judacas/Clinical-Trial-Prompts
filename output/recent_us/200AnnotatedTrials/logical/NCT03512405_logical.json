TKIs are not permitted to be continued at screening (e.g. Gleevec)\n  * Intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy may be dosed up to 7 days prior to first dose of pembrolizumab (cytarabine [Ara-C] recommended)\n  * For biologics (e.g. monoclonal antibodies), washout period of 1 month beyond the recommended dosing interval and at least 4 weeks or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) since the last dose\n* All acute toxic effects of any prior antitumor therapy must be resolved to grade =< 1 before enrollment, with the exception of alopecia (any grade permitted), or bone marrow parameters (any grades permitted)\n* For female subjects of childbearing potential, willingness to abstain from heterosexual intercourse or use 2 concurrent protocol recommended methods of contraception from the screening visit throughout the study treatment period and to 30 days from the last dose of pembrolizumab;
