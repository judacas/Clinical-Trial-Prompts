(Note: Patients may elect to decrease their analgesic use during the study as per discussion with their provider. Unexpected dose adjustments including dose escalations due to unforeseen clinical need is allowed. Cannabis taken for pain relief would qualify as an analgesic)\n* Comfortable using a tablet computer, a computer, or a smartphone to access online training\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be FEMALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
        "exclusion_criteria": "* Evidence of metastatic disease\n* Other active cancer (with the exception of non-melanoma skin cancer)\n* Completed chemotherapy or radiation therapy less than four weeks prior to enrollment (these treatments can cause temporary exacerbation of musculoskeletal symptoms that typically resolve spontaneously)\n* Completed surgery less than 8 weeks prior to enrollment (because surgery can cause temporary post-surgical pain that typically resolves in this period of time); minor surgeries may be allowed more recently than 8 weeks at the discretion of the study team\n* Have diagnosed or suspected condition that would interfere with informed consent or completion of study activities (e.g., significant impairment in cognition or uncorrected hearing/vision)",
