Bone marrow plasmacytosis with ≥ 10% plasma cells in bone marrow biopsy\n2. Immunoparesis (reduction in at least one uninvolved immunoglobulin in blood)\n3. ≥ 95% aberrant plasma cells of all plasma cells by flow cytometry of the bone marrow aspirate\n\n   * Creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥ 30 ml/min. CrCl will be calculated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation.\n   * Age ≥ 18 years.\n   * Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2\n   * Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.0 x 109 /L, hemoglobin more or equal than 2 grams below the institutional level of normal and platelet count ≥ 90 x 109/L. Platelet and blood transfusions are allowed on protocol. Growth factors, including granulocyte colony stimulating factors and erythropoietin are allowed.\n   * Adequate hepatic function, with bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x the ULN, and AST and ALT ≤ 2.5 x ULN.\n   * Females of childbearing potential are eligible to participate if they agree to avoid pregnancy by using an adequate method of contraception that is highly effective with a failure rate of <1% per year (2 barrier method or 1 barrier method with a spermicide or intrauterine device during and for 4 months after the last dose of belantamab mafodotin). Adequate methods of contraception are provided as examples. Other acceptable and effective methods of birth control are also permitted (eg, abstinence). Women of child bearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test result within 72 hours prior to the first administration of belantamab mafodotin and at the end of treatment visit. A negative urine pregnancy test is required prior to each subsequent belantamab mafodotin dose administration\n   * Females of childbearing potential are eligible to participate if they agree to notdonate eggs (ova, oocytes) for the purpose of reproduction during the study and for 4 months after the last dose of belantamab mafodotin.\n   * Male participants are eligible to participate if they agree to the following from the time of first dose of belantamab mafodotin until 6 months after the last dose of study treatment to allow for clearance of any altered sperm:\n\n     * be abstinent from heterosexual intercourse as their preferred and usual lifestyle (abstinent on a long term and persistent basis) and agree to remain abstinent,\n     * OR must agree to use contraception/barrier as follows:\n     * agree to use a male condom, even if they have undergone a successful vasectomy\n     * and female partner of childbearing potential to use an additional highly effective contraceptive method with a failure rate of <1% per year when having sexual intercourse.\n   * Men must agree to not donate sperm while on the study and for at least 6 months after the last dose of belantamab mafodotin.\n   * Subjects must be able to give informed consent.\n   * Subjects must be either newly diagnosed smoldering myeloma or not have received prior or concurrent treatment for smoldering multiple myeloma with chemotherapy agents approved for the treatment of smoldering multiple myeloma.

Steroids may be used treat infusion related reactions.

It is not known whether belantamab mafodotin is excreted in human milk. The effect of belantamab mafodotin of newborns/infants is unknown. Women should be advised to discontinue breast-feeding prior to initiating treatment with belantamab mafodotin and for at least 70 days after the last dose. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.\n   * Active hepatitis B or C infection\n   * Known HIV infection\n   * Known immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reaction or idiosyncratic reaction to drugs chemically related to belantamab mafodotin\n   * Concurrent treatment with other anti-cancer therapy is not permitted\n   * Has significant cardiovascular disease with:\n\n     * NYHA Class III or IV symptoms,\n     * uncontrolled hypertension\n     * hypertrophic cardiomyopathy restrictive cardiomyopathy, or myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndromes (including unstable angina), coronary angioplasty, or stenting or bypass grafting within 3 months prior to enrollment\n     * evidence of current clinically significant uncontrolled arrhythmias, including clinically significant ECG abnormalities such as 2nd degree (Mobitz Type II) or 3rd degree atrioventricular (AV) block as determined by history and physical examination.\n   * Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including but not limited to active infection requiring treatment or psychiatric illness/social situations that would compromise compliance with study requirements\n   * Contraindication to any concomitant medication, including pre-medications or hydration given prior to therapy\n   * Major surgery within 1 month prior to enrollment\n   * Previous or concurrent malignancies other than disease under study, unless the second malignancy has been medically stable for at least 2 years and, in the opinion of the principal investigators, will not affect the evaluation of the effects of clinical trial treatments on the currently targeted malignancy. Participants with curatively treated non-melanoma skin cancer may be enrolled without a 2-year restriction.\n   * Presence of active renal condition (infection, requirement for dialysis, or any other condition that could affect participant's safety). Participants with isolated proteinuria resulting are eligible, provided they fulfil renal criteria provided above.\n   * Any evidence of active mucosal or internal bleeding\n   * Received prior treatment with a monoclonal antibody within 30 days of receiving the first dose of belantamab mafodotin\n   * Cirrhosis or current unstable liver or biliary disease defined by the presence of ascites, encephalopathy, coagulopathy, hypoalbuminemia, esophageal or gastric varices, persistent jaundice, or cirrhosis. Note: Stable non-cirrhotic chronic liver disease (including Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones) or hepatobiliary involvement of malignancy is acceptable if otherwise meets entry criteria\n   * Current corneal epithelial disease except mild changes in corneal epithelium\n   * Use of contact lenses while participating in this study, except at the direction of the study MD/OD\n   * Severe dry eye patients and monocular patients are excluded",
