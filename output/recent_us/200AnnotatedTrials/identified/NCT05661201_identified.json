Risk factors for Torsades de Pointe (TdP) including uncorrected hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, history of cardiac failure, or history of clinically significant/symptomatic bradycardia.\n    2. Concomitant use of medication(s) with a known risk to prolong the QT interval and/or known to cause Torsades de Pointe that cannot be discontinued (within 5 half-lives or 7 days prior to starting study drug) or replaced by safe alternative medication\n    3. Inability to determine the QT interval on screening (QTcF, using Fridericia's correction)\n  * Systolic blood pressure (SBP) >160 mmHg or <90 mmHg at screening",
