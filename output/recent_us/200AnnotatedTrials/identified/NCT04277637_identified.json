DLBCL i. R/R DLBCL (including all subtypes of DLBCL) defined as disease that relapsed after, or was refractory to, at least two prior systemic therapies and has either progressed following or is not a candidate for autologous stem cell transplant (due to comorbidities or non-responsiveness to salvage chemotherapy)\n4. Transformed indolent B-cell NHL i. Any lymphoma otherwise eligible for Part 1 that has transformed into a more aggressive lymphoma. Patients with transformation from CLL or SLL (Richter's transformation) are not eligible for Part 1\n\n   CLL/SLL Cohorts:\n5.
