A female of childbearing potential is any woman, regardless of sexual orientation or whether they have undergone tubal ligation, who meets the following criteria:\n\n  * Has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or\n  * Has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months)\n  * Women must not be pregnant or breast-feeding due to potential harm to the fetus or infant from ALK inhibitors and the unknown risk. Women of childbearing potential and sexually active males must agree to use an accepted and effective method of contraception or to abstain from sexual intercourse for the duration of their participation in the study\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",

Whole brain RT or other palliative RT must have been completed at least 2 weeks prior to study entry\n* Prior dose of next generation ALK inhibitor (LDK378 [ceritinib], alectinib, ensartinib, lorlatinib) within 5 days prior to step 2 registration. Prior dose of brigatinib within 7 days prior to step 2 registration\n* History of interstitial lung disease or interstitial fibrosis, including a history of pneumonitis, obliterative bronchiolitis, pulmonary fibrosis. Patients with a history of prior radiation pneumonitis are not excluded\n* Active inflammatory gastrointestinal disease (such as Crohns, ulcerative colitis), chronic diarrhea, symptomatic diverticular disease, or any gastrointestinal disease that would affect the absorption of oral medications or increase the risk of toxicity\n* Clinically significant cardiovascular abnormalities, as determined by the treating/registering physician, such as uncontrolled hypertension, congestive heart failure New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification of 3, unstable angina or poorly controlled arrhythmia, or myocardial infarction within 6 months\n* Active and clinically significant bacterial, fungal, or viral infection\n* Patients with active or chronic pancreatitis based on lipase elevation, symptoms, and radiographic findings\n* Other concomitant serious illness or organ system dysfunction that in the opinion of the investigator would either compromise patient safety or interfere with the evaluation of the safety of the study drug\n* Patients must not plan to receive any other investigational agents during the course of therapy\n* Patients with active malignancy other than ALK-positive non-squamous NSCLC within the last 2 years are excluded (note: adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, papillary thyroid cancer treated with curative intent, adequately treated stage I or II cancer from which the patient is currently in complete remission, or any other cancer from which the patient has been disease free for 2 years are eligible)\n* No chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy allowed after step 1 registration",
