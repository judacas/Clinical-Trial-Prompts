Patients treated with FOLFOXIRI may enroll after progression or intolerance to that regimen.\n* For metastatic MSS CRC cohort, must have tumor lesions amenable to repeated biopsy, and patient's acceptance to have a tumor biopsy of an accessible lesion at baseline and on treatment if the lesion can be biopsied with acceptable clinical risk (as judged by the Principal Investigator).\n* For metastatic MSS CRC patients, must have measurable disease per RECIST 1.1.\n\nReinduction Treatment Cohort:\n\n* Have a single site of locoregional recurrence or distant metastasis noted on imaging > 12 months after the first dose of the mutant KRAS peptide vaccine with poly-ICLC adjuvant.\n* Have completed definitive treatment for solitary recurrence per standard-of-care (e.g. surgical resection, radiation, and/or chemotherapy) <6 months prior to screening for reinduction treatment.\n\nBoth Cohorts:\n\n*Age ≥18 years.\n\n* Have sufficient archival tumor tissue for next-generation sequencing (NGS) and immune-phenotyping.\n* Have one of the KRAS mutations included in the vaccine at the time of vaccination expressed in tumor.\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1\n* Life expectancy of greater than 6 months.\n* Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function defined by study-specified laboratory tests prior to initial study drug.\n* Woman of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test and follow contraceptive guidelines as defined per protocol.\n* Men must use acceptable form of birth control while on study.\n* Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n\nExclusion Criteria\n\n* If expected to require any other form of systemic or localized antineoplastic therapy while on study.\n* Within 2 weeks prior to first dose of study drug.\n\n  * Systemic or topical steroids corticosteroids at immunosuppressive doses (> 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent). Inhaled or topical steroids, and adrenal replacement steroid doses ≤ 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent, are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease.\n  * Any palliative or adjuvant radiation or gamma knife radiosurgery.\n  * Any chemotherapy.\n* Within 4 weeks prior to first dose of study drug.\n\n  * Any investigational cytotoxic drug.\n  * Any investigational device.\n  * Has received a live vaccine.\n  * Received any allergen hyposensitization therapy.\n  * Received any growth factors, e.g. granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), erythropoietin.\n  * Any major surgery.\n* PDAC or metastatic MSS CRC Cohort: Prior treatment with immunotherapy agents (including, anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA4), etc.).\n* Hypersensitivity reaction to any monoclonal antibody.\n* Known history or evidence of brain metastases.\n* Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years, or a documented history of clinically severe autoimmune disease, or a syndrome that requires systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents.\n* Known history or concurrent interstitial lung disease.\n* Has a pulse oximetry < 92% on room air.\n* Requires the use of home oxygen.\n* Infection with HIV or hepatitis B or C.\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, uncontrolled infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina, cardiac arrhythmia, metastatic cancer, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* Has been diagnosed with another cancer or myeloproliferative disorder within the past 5 year.\n* Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency.\n* Presence of any tissue or organ allograft, regardless of need for immunosuppression, including corneal allograft. Patients with a history of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant will be excluded.\n* Any other sound medical, psychiatric, and/or social reason as determined by the Investigator.\n* Unwilling or unable to follow the study schedule for any reason.\n* Are pregnant or breastfeeding.\n* For metastatic MSS CRC and Reinduction Treatment Cohorts, any peritoneal involvement by the tumor.\n* For metastatic MSS CRC and Reinduction Treatment Cohorts, any radiological or clinical pleural effusions or ascites.\n* For metastatic MSS CRC and Reinduction Treatment Cohorts, patients on parenteral nutrition.\n* For metastatic MSS CRC and Reinduction Treatment Cohorts, patients with any single liver metastases greater than 5 cm or greater > 50% liver involvement.\n* For metastatic MSS CRC and Reinduction Treatment Cohorts, history of malignant bowel obstruction.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
