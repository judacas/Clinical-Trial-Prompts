Male and female subjects who agree to use both a highly effective method of birth control (eg, implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some intrauterine devices [IUDs], complete abstinence , or sterilized partner) and a barrier method (eg., condoms, vaginal ring, sponge, etc) during the period of therapy and for 30 days after the last dose of study drug for females and 90 days for males.

PT/INR <1.5 x ULN and PTT (aPTT) <1.5 x ULN (unless abnormalities are unrelated to coagulopathy or bleeding disorder).\n8. Free of prior malignancies for 3 years with exception of patients diagnosed with basal cell or non-metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or carcinoma in situ of the cervix or breast, who are eligible even if they are currently treated or were treated and/or diagnosed in the past 3 years prior to study enrolment\n9.

Any other severe concurrent disease, or history of serious organ dysfunction or disease involving the heart, kidney, liver or other organ system that, in the investigator's opinion, may place the patient at undue risk to undergo therapy with ibrutinib\n10.
