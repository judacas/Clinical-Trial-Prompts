Any medical or psychiatric condition, substance abuse disorder, medical therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might interfere with the patient's participation for the full duration of the study or compliance with the requirements of the study\n11. Known active hepatitis B (hepatitis B surface antigen-reactive) or hepatitis C (hepatitis C virus RNA positive). Patients who are hepatitis B core antibody positive without hepatitis B surface antigen reactivity are eligible.
