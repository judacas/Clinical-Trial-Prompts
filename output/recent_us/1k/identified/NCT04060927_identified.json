        "inclusion_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria\n\nSubject must meet all of the following applicable inclusion criteria to participate in this study:\n\n1. Written informed consent with HIPAA authorization for release of personal health information.\n2. Age ≥18 years at the time of consent. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of fiducials in combination with SBRT in subjects <18 years of age, children are excluded from this study.\n3. ECOG Performance Status of ≤ 2.\n4. Stage IA-IIB (T1a-T3bN0) presumed non-small cell lung cancer, carcinoid tumors, or lung metastasis that have ≥ 1 cm of respiratory associated motion measured on 4DCT at time of simulation for SBRT with or without respiratory motion suppression techniques. Histologic confirmation of malignancy is encouraged but not required. Primary or metastatic tumor ≤ 7 cm.\n5. Subjects may be receiving systemic chemotherapy or other systemic agents prior to enrollment, but these agents must be stopped during SBRT treatments.\n6. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 14 days prior to day 1 of treatment. NOTE: Females are considered of child bearing potential unless they are surgically sterile (have undergone a hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or are postmenopausal (at least 12 consecutive months with no menses without an alternative medical cause).\n7. The effects of radiation on the developing human fetus are not well described. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential and non-sterilized men who are sexually active with a woman of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study treatment. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. FCBP must be willing to use a highly effective contraceptive method (i.e., achieves a failure rate of <1% per year when used consistently and correctly) from the time of informed consent until 5 days after last dose of SBRT. Contraceptive methods with low user dependency are preferable but not required.\n8. As determined by the enrolling physician, ability of the subject to understand and comply with study procedures for the entire length of the study\n\nExclusion Criteria\n\nSubjects meeting any of the criteria below may not participate in the study:\n\n1. Prior radiation to the chest that would overlap with the current radiation fields and determined by the treating physician to impede the treatment of the study malignancy.\n2. Active ongoing pulmonary infection or pneumonitis that is requiring active treatment with antibiotics or steroids. Prior pneumonitis from drug or other therapies that has been treated within 15 days of first day of treatment.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
