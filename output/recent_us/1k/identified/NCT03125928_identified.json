An HIV test must be performed to confirm status prior to enrollment.\n* Patients who are carriers of hepatitis virus B and C. Hepatitis B and C testing must be performed to confirm status prior to enrollment.\n* Prior therapy with an anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), anti-programmed cell death 1 ligand (PDL-1), anti-PD-L2, anti-CD137 antibody, or anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte -associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) antibody.\n* Pregnant, breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive within the projected time of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit and through 7 months after the last dose of trial treatment.\n* Active infection requiring systemic therapy.\n* Active substance abuse or psychiatric disorders.\n* The use of a RANKL inhibitor (denosumab) must be discontinued during the study. Bisphosphonate therapy is permitted.\n* The following treatments must be discontinued: Herbal Medications. Immunomodulatory agents, including but not limited to interferons or IL-2. Immunosuppressive medications, including but not limited to cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate, and thalidomide. Systemic corticosteroids. Anti-TNF-α agents.\n* Any live, attenuated vaccine within 28 days prior to the first day of treatment or during study treatment, or unwillingness to avoid live, attenuated vaccines within 90 days following the last dose of atezolizumab.",
