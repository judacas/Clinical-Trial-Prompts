Patients with targetable activating EGFR mutation, ALK rearrangement, ROS1 rearrangement, BRAF mutation or NTRK fusion that have available standard of care therapies.\n2.

(Note: Patients with controlled CNS metastasis can participate in the trial. Before entering the study, patients should have finished radiotherapy, or have received operation for CNS tumor metastasis at least two weeks before. Patients' neurological function must be in a stable state; no new neurological deficit is found during clinical examination and no new problem is found during CNS imaging examinations.

For Phase II study, patients with METex14 skipping mutation in tumor or ctDNA samples (local testing is acceptable for eligibility, however if the results of the central laboratory is available, the report of the central laboratory shall prevail); all patients in Phase II study will have confirmation of METex14 skipping mutation by Sponsor-designated central laboratory but this result is not necessary for eligibility.\n7. Availability of tumor tissue sample (either fresh tumor biopsy or archival tumor tissue sample); for patients of phase II study (not mandatory for safety run-in), if screened and enrolled based on local test results of METex14 skipping, the tumor tissue sample must be available for central laboratory testing before C2D1; if local testing results meet the requirements, patients of phase Ib are exempt from the central laboratory confirm.\n8. For Phase II study, patients are not eligible for chemotherapy or refuse chemotherapy after well-informed or have failed one or two prior lines of systemic therapies for the advanced NSCLC.\n\n   * Treatment failure is defined as documented disease progression or intolerance to treatment.\n   * Maintenance therapy given after first line chemotherapy will be considered as part of the first line if given to patients with documented response or stable disease before starting the maintenance therapy.\n   * Prior neoadjuvant/adjuvant systematic therapies will count as one prior line of treatment, provided that disease recurred within 12 months of completion of neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy.\n9. For Phase II study, at least one measurable lesion as per RECIST 1.1. (A previously irradiated site lesion may only be counted as a target lesion if there is clear sign of progression since the irradiation.)\n10. ECOG Performance Status (PS): 0-1.\n11. Adequate bone marrow reserve, renal and liver function:\n\n    * Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 × 109/L;\n    * Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL;\n    * Platelet count ≥ 75 × 109/L;\n    * Serum total bilirubin ≤ ULN (≤ 3 × ULN for patients with Gilbert's syndrome);\n    * Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 × ULN (≤ 5.0 × ULN for patients with hepatic metastasis);\n    * Creatinine clearance (calculated* or measured value**) ≥ 50 mL/min\n\n      * For calculated creatinine clearance (Ccr) value, the eligibility should be determined using the Cockcroft-Gault formula:\n\n        * Male Ccr (mL/mim) = body weight (kg) x (140-age)/[72 x creatinine (mg/dL)]\n        * Female Ccr (mL/min) = male Ccr x 0.85 ** A measured value\n    * International normalized ratio (INR) < 1.3 (or < 3.0 if on anticoagulation)"
