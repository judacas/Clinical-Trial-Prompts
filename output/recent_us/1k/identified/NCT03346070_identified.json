Please note the following: 1) Medically accepted methods of contraception include condoms (male or female) with a spermicidal agent, diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide, medically prescribed intrauterine device (IUD), inert or copper-containing IUD, surgical sterilization (e.g., hysterectomy or tubal ligation); 2) Abstinence (relative to heterosexual activity) can be used as the sole method of contraception if it is consistently employed as the subject's preferred and usual lifestyle and if considered acceptable by local regulatory agencies and Human Subjects Protection Review Boards; 3 Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, sympto-thermal, post-ovulation methods, etc.) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception; 4) If a contraceptive method listed above is restricted by local regulations/guidelines, then it does not qualify as an acceptable method of contraception for subjects participating at sites in this country/region.\n* Be able to provide (or the subject's legally authorized representative in accordance with local requirements), written informed consent for the trial. The participant or legally authorized representative may also provide consent for Future Biomedical Research.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
