        "inclusion_criteria": "1. Histologically confirmed metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma.\n2. Disease progression by PCWG3 criteria at study entry.\n3. Prior progression by PCWG3 criteria on one or more androgen signaling inhibitors including abiraterone acetate, enzalutamide, apalutamide, and/or darolutamide.\n4. No prior taxane-based chemotherapy for the treatment of mCRPC. Prior taxane use in the castration-sensitive prostate cancer (CSPC) setting allowed provided last dose > 6 months prior to study entry.\n5. Patients must be evaluable for the primary endpoint of composite response, and must have either serum PSA ≥ 2 ng/mL during Screening and/or measurable disease by RECIST 1.1 criteria.\n6. Participants must be willing to undergo metastatic tumor biopsy during Screening. If there is no safely accessible metastatic lesion, this requirement will be waived.\n7. Dose Expansion only: Participants must be willing to undergo CD46-directed Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging during Screening (Co-enrolling on NCT05245006, Groups B and C)\n8. Castrate level of serum testosterone at study entry (<50 ng/dL). Patients without prior bilateral orchiectomy are required to remain on Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analogue treatment for duration of study.\n9. No other systemic anti-cancer therapies administered other than LHRH analogue within 14 days or, 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter, prior to initiation of study treatment. Adverse events related to prior anti-cancer treatment related to therapies other than LHRH analogue must have recovered to Grade ≤ 1 with the exception of any grade alopecia. a. Patients receiving enzalutamide prior to study entry may continue treatment at their current enzalutamide dose level without requirement for wash-out period.\n10. Age >=18 years.\n11. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status <= 1 (Karnofsky performance status >= 70 percent (%)).\n12. Demonstrates adequate organ function as defined below:\n\n    1.

Adequate contraception includes:\n\n    1. Patients who are sexually active should consider their female partner to be of childbearing potential if she has experienced menarche and is not postmenopausal (defined as amenorrhea > 24 consecutive months) or has not undergone successful surgical sterilization.
