HIV serology at screening will be tested for German participants and any other country where required as per local regulations and serology hepatitis B and C at screening will be tested for all participants\n* Uncontrolled or active hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection: Patients with positive Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and/or HBV Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)\n\nOf note:\n\n* Patient can be eligible if anti-HBc Immunoglobulin G (IgG) positive (with or without positive anti-HBs) but HBsAg and HBV DNA are negative. If anti-HBV therapy in relation with prior infection was started before initiation of IMP, the anti-HBV therapy and monitoring should continue throughout the study treatment period.\n* Patients with negative HBsAg and positive HBV DNA observed during screening period will be evaluated by a specialist for start of anti-viral treatment: study treatment could be proposed if HBV DNA becomes negative and all the other study criteria are still met.\n* Active hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection: positive HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) and negative anti-HCV\n\nOf note:\n\n* Patients with antiviral therapy for HCV started before initiation of IMP and positive HCV antibodies are eligible. The antiviral therapy for HCV should continue throughout the treatment period until seroconversion.\n* Patients with positive anti-HCV and undetectable HCV RNA without antiviral therapy for HCV are eligible\n* Malabsorption syndrome or any condition that can significantly impact the absorption of lenalidomide\n* Any of the following within 3 months prior to randomization (or first study intervention administration in safety run-in cohort): treatment resistant peptic ulcer disease, erosive esophagitis or gastritis, infectious or inflammatory bowel disease, diverticulitis, pulmonary embolism, or other uncontrolled thromboembolic event\n* Received treatment (eg surgery, radiotherapy, medication) for a malignancy within 3 years of randomization (or first study intervention administration in safety run-in cohort)\n* Prior exposure to approved or investigational treatments for SMM or multiple myeloma (MM) (including but not limited to conventional chemotherapies, immunomodulatory imid drugs, or Proteasome inhibitors); concurrent use of bisphosphonates or receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) inhibitor denosumab is not permitted; however, prior bisphosphonates or once-a-year intravenous bisphosphonate given for the treatment of osteoporosis is permitted\n* Ongoing treatment with corticosteroids with a dose >10 mg prednisone or equivalent per day at the time of randomization (or first study intervention administration in safety run-in cohort)\n* Women of childbearing potential or male participant with women of childbearing potential who do not agree to use a highly effective method of birth control\n* Vaccination with a live vaccine 4 weeks before the start of the study drug. Seasonal flu vaccines that do not contain live virus are permitted\n\nThe above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a potential participation in a clinical trial.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
