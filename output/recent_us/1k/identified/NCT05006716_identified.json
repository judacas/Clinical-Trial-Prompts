Participants who have previously received a covalently-binding Bruton´s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor (BTKi) in any line of therapy must have received treatment with the BTK inhibitor for ≥ 8 weeks (unless reason for discontinuation is intolerance).\n3. For dose-finding and dose-expansion, participants who had previously received a covalently-binding BTK inhibitor as monotherapy or in combination with other anticancer agents are eligible for the study if they meet any of the following criteria: discontinued the previous BTK inhibitor due to disease progression, experienced disease progression after completing treatment with a BTK inhibitor or discontinued the BTK inhibitor due to toxicity or intolerance.\n4. Measurable disease by radiographic assessment or serum IgM level (WM only)\n5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 to 2\n6. Participants enrolling in the dose finding phase of the study may be previously treated with a BTKi or may be naïve to BTKi therapy depending on the diagnosis and country of enrollment; participants with MCL enrolling in the expansion cohorts (Phase 2) must have been treated with a BTKi in a prior line of therapy; CLL/SLL participants, in addition to being treated with a BTKi in a prior line of therapy, must also have received a Bcl-2 inhibitor in a prior line of therapy as well (Phase 2)."
