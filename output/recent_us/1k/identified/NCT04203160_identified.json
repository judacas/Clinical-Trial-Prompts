        "inclusion_criteria": "Inclusion:\n\n* Patients must have a pathologically or cytologically confirmed carcinoma (except neuroendocrine) of the biliary tract (intra-hepatic, extra-hepatic (hilar, distal) or gallbladder) that is not eligible for curative resection, transplantation, or ablative therapies. Tumors of mixed cholangiocarcinoma/hepatocellular carcinoma histology are excluded.\n* Patients may not have received prior systemic treatment (chemotherapy or targeted therapy) for advanced BTC. Prior peri-operative chemotherapy is permitted provided it was completed > 6 months from enrollment.\n* Patients may have received prior radiation, chemoembolization, radioembolization or other local ablative therapies or hepatic resection if completed ≥ 4 weeks prior to enrollment AND if patient has recovered to ≤ grade 1 toxicity. Extrahepatic palliative radiation is permitted if completed ≥ 2 weeks prior to enrollment AND if patient has recovered to ≤ grade 1 toxicity\n* Patients must have radiographically measurable disease (as per RECISTv1.1) in at least one site not previously treated with radiation or liver directed therapy (including bland, chemo- or radio-embolization, or ablation) either within the liver or in a metastatic site.\n* Must be ≥ 18 years of age.\n* Must have an ECOG performance status of 0-1.\n* Ability to understand and willingness to sign IRB-approved informed consent.\n* Willing to provide archived tissue, if available, from a previous diagnostic biopsy or surgery.\n* Must be able to tolerate CT and/or MRI with contrast.\n* Adequate organ function (per protocol) obtained ≤ 2 weeks prior to enrollment.\n* Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use 2 methods of adequate contraception (hormonal plus barrier or 2 barrier forms) OR abstinence prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation and for 6 months (for men and women) following completion of study therapy.\n\nExclusions:\n\n* Prior history of brain metastasis (unless previously treated, asymptomatic and stable for at least 3 months) or organ transplant.\n* Underwent a major surgical procedure < 4 weeks prior to enrollment.\n* Active second malignancy other than in situ cancer or localized prostate cancer (Gleason score <8). Patients with history of other malignancy are eligible provided primary treatment of that cancer was completed > 1 year prior to enrollment and the patient is free of clinical or radiologic evidence of recurrent or progressive malignancy.\n* Ongoing active, uncontrolled infection (must be afebrile for > 48 hours off antibiotics) .\n* Psychiatric illness, other significant medical illness, or social situation which, in the investigator's opinion, would limit compliance or ability to comply with study requirements.\n* Pregnancy or breastfeeding. (Women must not be pregnant or breastfeeding since study drugs may harm the fetus or child. All females of childbearing potential [not surgically sterilized and between menarche and 1 year post menopause] must have a negative screening pregnancy test.)\n* Active heart disease including symptomatic heart failure (NYHA class 3 or 4), unstable angina pectoris, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia or interstitial lung disease.\n* Prisoners or subjects who are involuntarily incarcerated, or compulsorily detained for treatment of either a psychiatric or physical (e.g. infectious disease) illness would be excluded.\n* Prolonged QTcF interval >480 msec.\n* Known hypersensitivity to cisplatin, gemcitabine or CPI-613, or its inactive components.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
