Examples include transient ischemic attacks, cerebrovascular accidents, hemodynamically significant (i.e. massive or sub-massive) deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary emboli. Note: Patients with either deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary emboli that does not result in hemodynamic instability are allowed to enroll as long as they are on a stable dose of anticoagulants for at least 4 weeks. Also note: Patients with thromboembolic events related to indwelling catheters or other procedures may be enrolled. Finally: patients with stable mesenteric thrombosis that predate study assessment (eg portal vein thrombus) may be enrolled.\n* Has a history of active bleeding requiring transfusion within a 3 month period prior to screening.
