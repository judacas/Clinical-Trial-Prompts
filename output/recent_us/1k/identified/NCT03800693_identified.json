Highly effective contraception methods include combination of any two of the following:\n\n  * Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or;\n  * Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS);\n  * Barrier methods of contraception: condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/ vaginal suppository;\n  * Total abstinence or;\n  * Male/female sterilization Women are considered post-menopausal and not of childbearing potential if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks prior to randomization. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of childbearing potential",
