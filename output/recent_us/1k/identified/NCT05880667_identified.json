Subjects must not have known active solid tumors on imaging outside of abdomen/pelvis noted on screening imaging\n5. Subjects must not have 6 or more active metastatic sites.\n6.

Subjects must not have uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n8. Any condition or significant co-morbidity that prevents safe delivery of SBRT per the discretion of the treating physician(s).\n9. Subjects must not be pregnant or breast-feeding.
