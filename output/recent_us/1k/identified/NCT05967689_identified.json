Participants who discontinued previous treatment due to unacceptable toxicity are eligible.\n\n     i. Permitted prior ex20ins therapies include: amivantamab, sunvozertinib (DZD9008), and BLU451. Other prior ex20ins--directed treatment may be discussed with the Sponsor for eligibility assessment.\n   * Participants with brain metastasis must be neurologically stable. Participants must have received central nervous system (CNS)-directed therapy and have no evidence of progression for at least 4 weeks after CNS-directed treatment, as ascertained by clinical examination and brain imaging (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] or computed tomography [CT] scan) during the Screening Period.
