PSA progression defined as 25% increase over baseline value with an increase in the absolute value of at least 1.0 ng/mL that is confirmed by another PSA level with a minimum of a 1 week interval and a minimum PSA of 1.0 ng/mL.\n  2. Soft-tissue progression defined as an increase ≥ 20% in the sum of the LD of all target lesions based on the smallest sum LD since treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions.\n  3.

        "exclusion_criteria": "* Received any other investigational therapeutic agents or other anticancer therapies within 4 weeks prior to randomization.\n\n  °Note: If this requirement to have a washout of 2 weeks or 5 half-lives prior to randomization causes potential treatment delay due to Radium-223 importation timelines, the PCCTC must be contacted at pcctc@mskcc.org to request approval to randomize the subject prior to the completion of the washout. Requests for early randomization must be accompanied by written assurance by the site that the washout will be completed prior to treatment start.\n* Received external beam radiotherapy within the 4 weeks prior to randomization.\n\n  ° Note: If prolonging randomization to complete EBRT washout causes potential treatment delay due to Radium-223 importation timelines, the PCCTC must be contacted at pcctc@mskcc.org to request approval to randomize the subject prior to the completion of the washout. Requests for early randomization must be accompanied by written assurance by the site that the washout will be completed prior to treatment start.\n* Has an immediate need for external beam radiotherapy.\n* Has received any systemic bone-seeking radiopharmaceutical in the past.\n* Has received any prostate cancer directed chemotherapy in the castration resistant setting. Subjects who have received up to 6 prior doses of docetaxel in the castration sensitive setting are permitted if they have not experienced disease progression within 36 weeks of last treatment with docetaxel.\n* Has received four or more systemic anticancer regimens for mCRPC.\n\n  * Treatment with docetaxel or abiraterone for non-castrate metastatic disease is permissible and does not count towards the lines of therapy for mCRPC\n  * A 'line' is a regimen. Combinations of hormones and other types of therapies count as single lines.\n* Has known Grade ≥3 docetaxel-related toxicities or docetaxel toxicity related dose interruption or discontinuation.\n* Has received blood transfusions or growth factors within the last 4 weeks prior to randomization.\n* Symptomatic nodal disease (i.e., scrotal, penile, or leg edema).\n* Has visceral metastases with ≥ 3 lung and/or liver metastases or individual lesion ≥2 cm, as assessed by CT scan or MRI of the chest/abdomen/pelvis within the last 8 weeks prior to randomization.\n* Symptomatic loco-regional disease that causes ongoing Grade 3 or Grade 4 urinary or rectal symptoms.\n* Subjects with a \"currently active\" second malignancy other than non-melanoma skin cancers or non-invasive bladder cancers or other in-situ or non-invasive malignancies. Subjects are not considered to have a \"currently active\" malignancy if they have completed therapy and are free of disease for ≥ 3 years.\n* Has imminent or established cord compression based on clinical findings and/or MRI.\n* Known bone marrow dysplasia\n* Has received any of the following in the 4 weeks prior to randomization: 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors, herbal medications, natural hormonally active foods (e.g., phytoestrogens) or other food supplements known to alter PSA in humans\n* Any other serious illness or medical condition that would, in the opinion of the investigator, make this protocol unreasonably hazardous, including but not limited to:\n\n  * Uncontrolled infection\n  * NYHA III or IV heart failure\n  * Crohn's disease or those with ulcerative colitis who have not undergone a colectomy\n  * Known active infection with HIV, Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C",
