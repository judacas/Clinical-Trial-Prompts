Subjects with hypersensitivity to these agents will be excluded from enrollment.\n* History of significant toxicity related to prior CDK4/6, MEK, or ERK inhibitor requiring discontinuation of treatments with these agents.\n* Concurrent, clinically significant, active malignancies within 12 months of study enrollment\n* Current evidence of a disorder that could reduce the ability to swallow oral dosage forms or alter absorption of orally administered drugs.\n* Patients who require concomitant use of medications that strongly induce or inhibit CYP3A or UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)\n* Non-tolerable Grade 2 or ≥ Grade 3 neuropathy or evidence of unstable neurological symptoms within 4 weeks of Cycle 1 Day 1.
