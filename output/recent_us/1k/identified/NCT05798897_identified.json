For participants with LBCL, FL, and MCL: Have received CD19-directed CAR T cell therapy and relapsed ≥ 30 days or attained an incomplete response as the best response within 1 year after CAR T cell administration.

Male participants are eligible to participate if they agree to the following during the intervention period and for at least 6 months after the last infusion of MT-601:\n\nRefrain from donating sperm\n\nPLUS either:\n\nBe abstinent from intercourse as their preferred and usual lifestyle (abstinent on a long-term and persistent basis) and agree to remain abstinent OR Must agree to use a male condom AND should also be advised of the benefit for a nonpregnant female partner to use a highly effective method of contraception as a condom may break or leak\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 100 Years",
