For Phase 2 only, no more than one intervening therapy since progression on BRAF/MEK inhibitor therapy is allowed. Subjects who have evidence of progression while on, or within 4 weeks of completing, combination BRAF/MEK inhibitor therapy in the adjuvant setting will be eligible\n* PHASE 2 ONLY: Patient must have EZH2 alteration (somatic mutation or copy number alteration). Can be performed on either archival or fresh specimen. EZH2 alterations need to be documented by a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA)/Clinical Laboratory Improvement Program (CLIP)-certified next generation sequencing platform (Foundation One, Tempus, Guardant360, etc.)\n* PHASE 2 ONLY: Patient must have measurable disease\n* PHASE 2 ONLY: Patient must have at least one tumor lesion amenable to biopsy. If possible, this lesion should be different from the lesion used for following tumor measurements but is not required\n* PHASE 2 ONLY: Patient must agree to planned pre-treatment and planned on-treatment biopsy.

Prophylactic low dose warfarin may be given to maintain central catheter patency\n* The effects of tazemetostat, and the combination of tazemetostat, dabrafenib and trametinib on the developing human fetus are unknown. Women of childbearing potential and all male patients must agree to the following:\n\n  * For women of childbearing potential: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive methods that result in a failure rate of < 1% per year during the treatment period, for 6 months after tazemetostat discontinuation, or for 6 months after discontinuation of the combination of tazemetostat, dabrafenib and trametinib. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately\n\n    * A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarcheal, has not reached a postmenopausal state (>= 12 continuous months of amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone surgical sterilization (removal of ovaries and/or uterus)\n    * Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of < 1% per year include bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, established, proper use of hormonal contraceptives that inhibit ovulation, hormone-releasing intrauterine devices, and copper intrauterine devices\n    * Due to the potential of enzyme induction with tazemetostat, female subjects who use hormonal contraceptives should use an additional barrier method of birth control while on study treatment and for 6 months after discontinuation of tazemetostat or the combination of tazemetostat, dabrafenib and trametinib\n    * The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or post ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception\n  * Women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test at screening\n  * For men: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive measures and agreement to refrain from donating sperm, as defined below:\n\n    * With female partners of childbearing potential or pregnant female partners, men must remain abstinent or use a condom during the treatment period and for at least 4 months after the last dose of study drug. Men must refrain from donating sperm during this same period. In addition, female partners of male subjects should adhere to the following:\n\n      * Intrauterine device (IUD) (must provide medical documentation of IUD)\n      * Hormonal contraceptive (partner must be on a stable dose of the same hormonal contraceptive product for at least 4 weeks before receiving study drug) AND a condom (hormonal contraceptives must be supplemented with condoms)\n    * The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. Participants with impaired decision-making capacity (IDMC) who have a legally-authorized representative (LAR) and/or family member available will also be eligible\n* Have progressed on, been intolerant to, is ineligible for, or has refused prior standard of care anti-PD-1 based immunotherapy\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
