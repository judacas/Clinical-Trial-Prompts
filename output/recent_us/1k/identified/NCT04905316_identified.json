The following are exceptions to this criterion:\n\n    i. Intranasal, inhaled, topical steroids, or local steroid injections (e.g., intra articular injection) ii. Systemic corticosteroids at physiologic doses not to exceed 10 mg/day of prednisone or its equivalent for less than 30 days. iii.

Note that some contraception methods are not considered highly effective (e.g. female cap, diaphragm, or sponge with or without spermicide; non-copper containing intrauterine device; progestogen-only oral hormonal contraceptive pills where inhibition of ovulation is not the primary mode of action [excluding Cerazette/desogestrel which is considered highly effective]; and triphasic combined oral contraceptive pills).\n* Connective tissue disorders involving the lung(s) and/or esophagus requiring active treatment or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis\n* Known history of active primary immunodeficiency\n* Known allergy or hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs or any of the study drug excipients.\n* Receipt of live vaccination within 3 months prior to the first dose of study durg.
