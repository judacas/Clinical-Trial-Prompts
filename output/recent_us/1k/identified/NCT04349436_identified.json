Patients must have progressed following local resection, prior radiation, topical or systemic therapies.\n4. Documentation from the patient's transplant physician confirming that the patient's allograft is stable.\n5. Patients for whom surgical or radiation treatment of lesions is contraindicated.\n6. At least 1 lesion that is measurable and injectable by study criteria (tumor of ≥1cm in longest diameter or ≥1.5 cm in shortest diameter for lymph nodes).\n7. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤1.\n8. Anticipated life expectancy > 6 months\n9. Baseline ECG without evidence of acute ischemia.\n10.

Patients with a history of organ graft rejection within 12 months.\n5. Had systemic infection requiring intravenous (IV) antibiotics or anti-virals, or other serious infection within 60 days prior to dosing.\n6. Patients who require intermittent or chronic use of systemic (oral or intravenous) anti-virals with known anti-herpetic activity (e.g., acyclovir) unless for organ allograft preservation.\n7. Patients requiring CTLA-4-Ig medications.\n8. Ongoing or recent (within 5 years) evidence of significant autoimmune disease that required treatment with systemic immunosuppressive treatments beyond that required for maintenance allograft rejection prevention. The following are not exclusionary: vitiligo, childhood asthma that has resolved, type 1 diabetes, residual hypothyroidism that requires only hormone replacement, or psoriasis that does not require systemic treatment.\n9. Active infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).\n10. Any history of transplant-related viral infections, such as BKV, EBV or CMV, within 3 months of study entry. Patients with a history of hepatitis B or C virus must have undetectable viral load within 3 months of study entry.\n11. Patients with a condition requiring an increase in the patient's usual immunosuppressive medications within 60 days of study treatment.\n12.
