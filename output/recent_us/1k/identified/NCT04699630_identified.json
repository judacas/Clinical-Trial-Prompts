Has any history of ILD (including pulmonary fibrosis or radiation pneumonitis), has clinically significant ILD, or is suspected to have such disease by imaging during screening. If imaging findings are unlikely to indicate a history of pneumonitis, then the Investigator should discuss the considerations with the Medical Monitor about potential enrollment and record the reasoning in the source documentation.\n4. Clinically severe pulmonary compromise (based on Investigator's assessment) resulting from intercurrent pulmonary illnesses including, but not limited to:\n\n   * Any underlying pulmonary disorder (e.g., pulmonary emboli, severe asthma, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, restrictive lung disease, pleural effusion)\n   * Any autoimmune, connective tissue or inflammatory disorder with pulmonary involvement (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren's syndrome, sarcoidosis)\n\n   OR prior pneumonectomy\n5.

Part B patients only: Prior treatment with trastuzumab deruxtecan, sacituzumab govitecan, and/or datopotamab deruxtecan with any of the following:\n\n    * A severe reaction or severe tolerability issues that necessitated stopping treatment with the therapy\n    * Any unresolved toxicities from the prior therapy greater than Grade 1, with the exception of alopecia\n\n    Additional exclusion criteria only for Part Z (HER2-positive) cohort:\n18.
