If use of a sensitive CYP3A substrate with KRT-232 cannot be avoided, monitor subjects closely for toxicity. There is no identified drug-drug interaction potential for KRT-232 with other CYP enzymes\n* Patient must not have received known moderate or strong CYP3A inducers within 7 days of enrollment; antifungal drugs, including those that are CYP3A inhibitors, are permitted; as part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product\n* Treatment with medications known to cause corrected QT (QTc) interval prolongation within 7 days of study day 1 is not permitted unless approved by the principal investigator; use of ondansetron is permitted for treatment of nausea and vomiting\n* Current use of warfarin, factor Xa inhibitors and direct thrombin inhibitors\n\n  * Note: Low molecular weight heparin and prophylactic low dose warfarin are permitted; PT/PTT must meet the inclusion criteria; subjects taking warfarin must have their INR followed closely\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements; patients receiving an anti-microbial agent may be eligible if the patient remains afebrile and hemodynamically stable for 72 hours; patients with myocardial infarction within 6 months of study day 1, symptomatic congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class III and higher), unstable angina, or cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication are excluded\n* Patients with gastrointestinal (GI) tract disease causing the inability to take oral medication, malabsorption syndrome, requirement for intravenous alimentation, prior surgical procedures affecting absorption, uncontrolled inflammatory GI disease (e.g., Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis)\n* Patients with history of bleeding diathesis\n* Positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HepBsAg) (indicative of chronic hepatitis B), positive hepatitis total core antibody with negative HBsAG (suggestive of occult hepatitis B), or detectable hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (RNA) by a polymerase-chain reaction (PCR) assay (indicative of active hepatitis C - screening is generally done by hepatitis C antibody [HepCAb], followed by hepatitis C virus RNA by PCR if HepCAb is positive)\n* Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-patients positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are NOT excluded from this study, but HIV-positive patients must have:\n\n  * A stable regimen of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART)\n  * No requirement for concurrent antibiotics or antifungal agents for the prevention of opportunistic infections\n  * A CD4 count above 250 cells/mcL and an undetectable HIV viral load on standard PCR-based test\n* Men and women of reproductive potential who are unwilling to practice acceptable methods of effective birth control while on study through 5 weeks (women) or 3 months and 1 week (men) after receiving the last dose of KRT-232 (AMG-232); acceptable methods of effective birth control include sexual abstinence (men, women); vasectomy; or a condom with spermicide (men) in combination with barrier methods, hormonal birth control or IUD (women)\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because KRT-232 (AMG-232) is an agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with KRT-232 (AMG-232), breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with KRT-232 (AMG-232); these potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study\n* Patients with a baseline QTc > 500 msec and patients with a family history of prolonged QT syndrome\n* Patients with known TP53 mutations or chromosome 17 or 17p deletions\n* Patients previously treated with azacytidine, decitabine, or venetoclax",
