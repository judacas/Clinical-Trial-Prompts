Adequate hepatic function [total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x UNL; AST (aspartate transaminase) or ALT (alanine transaminase) ≤ 3 x UNL or ≤ 5 x UNL if due to liver involvement by tumor.\n11. Negative pregnancy test for women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) and males need to agree to use a highly effective method of contraception if not surgically sterile prior to study entry, while on drug, and for 3 months' time after the last dose. Please refer to Appendix 1 for acceptable effective contraceptive methods.\n12. Subject who has predicted life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.\n\nExclusion Criteria Subjects meet one or more of below criteria will be excluded\n\n1. Lactating, pregnant, or intend to be pregnant.\n2. Received anti-cancer therapy or other investigational drugs within 4 weeks prior to the 1st dose of study drug.\n3. Patient in use of sensitive substrates of major cytochrome P450 enzymes and transporters based on FDA Drug Development and Drug Interactions, Table of Substrates, Inhibitors, and Inducers, or strong inducers of transporter, P-gp, including apalutamide, carbamazepine, enzalutamide, mitotane, phenytoin, rifampin, St. John's wort. Patient in use of strong inhibitors of transporters based on based on FDA Drug Development and Drug Interactions, Table of Substrates, Inhibitors, and Inducers (Appendix 2).\n4. All acute toxic effect of any prior antitumor therapy resolved to Grade 1 before the start of study therapy (with the exception of alopecia [G 1 or 2 permitted], neurotoxicity [Grade ≤ 2 permitted], or selected lab parameters [Grade < 2 permitted with exceptions noted below].\n5. Has evidence of another malignancy not in remission or history of such a malignancy within the last 3 years (except for treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or in situ cancer of the cervix). Concomitant malignancies except carcinoma in situ, basal or squamous cell skin carcinoma; low grade prostate cancer treated with prostatectomy more than 5 years ago; early-stage melanoma treated with complete surgical excision more than 5 years ago; carcinoma in situ of cervix treated with cone procedure more than 8 years ago.\n6. Has symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastases, except where metastases are stable over a three-month period.\n7. Has unstable bleeding disorder or currently under non-established course of anticoagulant therapy (except for the use of heparinized saline to maintain the patency of central venous catheters).\n8. Has a medical history of symptomatic CHF (New York Heart Association [NYHA] classes II-IV) or serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring treatment.\n9. Has a medical history of myocardial infarction or unstable angina within 6 months before registration.\n10. Has a QTcF prolongation to > 470 ms based on a 12-lead ECG in triplicate, or other abnormalities that in the opinion of the Investigator increase the risk of participating in the study.\n11. Has higher or equal to Grade 3 hypertension (≥ 160/100 mmHg) or ≤ 80/50 mmHg; has heart rate (HR) ≥ 100 beats per minute (bpm), or ≤ 45 bpm, confirmed by a repeat assessment.\n12. Has evidence of electrolyte imbalance such as hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesaemia of NCI-CTCAE Grade ≥ 2 (symptomatic, intervention indicated).\n13. Major surgery besides tumor resection, within 4 weeks prior to screening\n14. Has uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, neurologic or psychiatric condition, an ongoing systemic (including opportunistic) clinically significant infections or any other significant or unstable concurrent medical illness that may increase the risk of study participants determined by Investigator.\n15. Has a known history of human immunodeficiency virus\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
