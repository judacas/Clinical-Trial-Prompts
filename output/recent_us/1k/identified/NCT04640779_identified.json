Highly effective forms of birth control include: hormonal contraceptives (oral, injectable, patch, and intrauterine devices), male partner sterilization, or total abstinence from heterosexual intercourse, when this is the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient NOTE: The double-barrier method (e.g., synthetic condoms, diaphragm, or cervical cap with spermicidal foam, cream, or gel), periodic abstinence (such as calendar, symptothermal, post-ovulation), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), lactational amenorrhea method, and spermicide-only are not acceptable as highly effective methods of contraception\n\n    * Provide written informed consent\n    * Willing to return to enrolling institution for follow-up (during the Active Monitoring Phase of the study)\n    * Willingness to provide mandatory blood specimens per protocol for Pharmacokinetics (PKs) and banking\n    * For lymphoma, extramedullary myeloma and histiocytic/dendritic cell neoplasms, willing to provide mandatory tissue samples for correlative research.
