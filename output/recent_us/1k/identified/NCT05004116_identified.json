Patients with ALK, ROS1, or NTRK1/2/3 fusions are permitted to enroll in this cohort if progressed on prior targeted therapy or are not eligible for a higher priority study of single agent inhibition (ex: repotrectinib monotherapy IRB# 20-077).\n* Cohort 4: Patients with recurrent or progressive DIPG. Patients with typical DIPG, defined as tumors with a pontine epicenter and diffuse involvement of at least 2/3 of the pons on at least 1 axial T2-weighted image, are eligible. No histologic confirmation is required. Patients with pontine tumors that do not meet radiographic criteria for typical DIPG (e.g., focal tumors or those involving less than 2/3 of the pontine cross sectional area with or without extrapontine extension) are eligible if the tumors are biopsied and proven to be high-grade gliomas (such as anaplastic astrocytoma, glioblastoma, high-grade glioma NOS, and/or H3 K27M-mutant by immunohistochemistry or next generation sequencing CLIA certified) by institutional diagnosis.\n* Patients treated in Phase 1 at RP2D will be evaluable in the Phase 2 cohort if they meet all other inclusion criteria for the specified cohort. Patients receiving oral capsule OR oral suspension can be included in Phase 2 cohort. Enrollment of patients of at least 12 years old can begin treatment in Phase 2 once TPX-0005 (Repotrectinib) combination therapy RP2D is defined in Phase 1A (even if Phase 1B is not yet completed) Exception: DIPG patients may be enrolled on phase 2 cohort 4 prior to the completion of Phase 1 since they will receive TPX-0005 (Repotrectinib) monotherapy at the pediatric RP2D.\n* Tissue Analysis\n\n  * Phase 1: All patients must have archived tissue available for analysis (exception: DIPG patients), but ALK/ROS/NTRK status verification is not required prior to enrollment. If no archival tissue is available, waiver may be permitted by study PI (phase 1 only).\n  * Phase 2: Prior to enrollment, all patients must have ALK/ROS/NTRK status evaluated in CLIA lab or equivalent by any nucleic acid-based diagnostic testing method (e.g., next-generation sequencing [NGS], Sanger sequencing, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction).
