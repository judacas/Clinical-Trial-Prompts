However endocrine therapies (tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors), anti-HER2 therapy and bisphosphonates are permitted without restriction even during protocol treatment. Standard-of-care maintenance treatments such as pembrolizumab and capecitabine are permitted during protocol treatment. All of these treatments are delivered routinely as SOC during conventional radiotherapy.\n* Unwilling or unable to participate in all required study evaluations and procedures.
