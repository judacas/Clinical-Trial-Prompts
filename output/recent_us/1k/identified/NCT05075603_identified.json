Receipt of live, attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to NT-I7 injection. Note: Subjects, if enrolled, should not receive live vaccine during the study and through 30 days after NT-I7 injection, whichever is longer.

Subjects must have measurable disease by IWG response criteria for lymphoma [Lugano classification (3)]\n\n   1. Baseline fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET/computed tomography (CT) scans must show positive lesions compatible with CT-defined anatomical tumor sites but will not be used in subsequent clinical decisions.\n   2. A previously irradiated lesion can be considered a target lesion if the lesion is well defined, measurable, and has clearly progressed.\n   3. Subjects that received bridging therapy pre-lymphodepletion will be allowed for enrollment regardless of re-staging results (PMR or CMR), even if the lesion is not measurable per the criteria mentioned above.\n   4. PET/CT scans done as SOC up to 28 days pre-lymphodepletion therapy will be allowed.\n\n   All subjects whose scans are > 28 days from lymphodepletion therapy will need a re-staging FDG-PET/CT scan.\n7. (This is a placeholder for inclusion criterion 7, which has been removed.)\n8. Subjects must have a life expectancy of greater than or equal to 12 weeks per assessment from the enrolling physician.\n9. Adequate organ and marrow function per institutional guidelines at the start of lymphodepleting chemotherapy as pre-conditioning for SOC CD19 CAR T-cell infusion.\n\nThe following laboratory parameters (9a-h) are recommendations. Labs outside of these ranges may be considered for inclusion after consultation with the medical monitor. Cytopenia resulting from disease or bridging therapy will not be considered exclusionary.\n\n1. Hemoglobin ≥8.0 g/dL or ≥4.96 mmol/L\n2. Absolute neutrophil count ≥1,000/µL\n3. Platelets >50,000/µL\n4.

AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤2.5 × ULN (AST and/or ALT ≤5 × ULN for subjects with liver metastasis)\n6. Alkaline phosphatase ≤2.5 × ULN (≤5 × ULN for subjects with documented liver involvement or bone metastases)\n7. Creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥30 mL/min as calculated per institutional standard.\n8. INR and aPTT ≤1.5 × ULN unless subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or aPTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants 10. Female subjects who are either postmenopausal for at least 1 year, are surgically sterile for at least 6 weeks; female subjects of childbearing potential must agree to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or to use dual methods of contraception for the duration of study treatment and for 90 days after NT-I7 injection, whichever is longer. Female subjects of childbearing potential (including women who have had a tubal ligation) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to NT-I7 injection. If the urine test is positive, or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required.\n\n   11. ECG demonstrating Fridericia's corrected QT interval (QTcF) < 500 ms. Patients with QTcF ≥ 500 ms will require clearance by a local cardiologist."
