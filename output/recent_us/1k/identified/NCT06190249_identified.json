Patients with positive serology for hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) or hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) indicating acute or chronic infection must have the corresponding polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay; patients may be enrolled if the viral load by PCR is undetectable with/without active treatment.
