(Evaluation of cerebrospinal fluid is only required if there is a clinical suspicion of CNS involvement by leukemia during screening in subjects without a history of CNS involvement).\n* Subjects with immediate life-threatening, severe complications of leukemia such as uncontrolled bleeding, pneumonia with hypoxia or shock, and/or disseminated intravascular coagulation.\n* Requires ongoing treatment with\n\n  * Systemic acid-reducing agents including H-2-receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors\n  * Sensitive CYP2C8 substrates (such as montelukast, pioglitazone, repaglinide, rosiglitazone) or CYP2C8 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., amiodarone, fosphenytoin, paclitaxel, penprocoumon, phenytoin)",
