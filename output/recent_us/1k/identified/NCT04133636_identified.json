The dose/schedule of cycles administered will be as per standard of care. It is acceptable for up to 1 cycle of the protocol-specified regimens to be missing one of the listed agents (example, held due to toxicity).

A minimum of one lesion with a bi-dimensional measurement of at least 1 centimeter (cm)*1 cm is required\n* Cohorts B, C: For participants with neither serum nor urine measurable disease, baseline positron emission tomography/ computed tomography (PET/CT) or whole body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be used to satisfy the measurable disease criteria\n* Cohorts A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status grade of 0 or 1\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
