No more than two prior lines of chemotherapy administered in the mCRPC setting. Chemotherapy administered in the castration-sensitive setting does not count towards this limit.\n\n   c. Measurable disease by RECIST 1.1 criteria.\n6. Phase 2 Cohort B (mCRPC without transdifferentiation) only:\n\n   1. Patients must not meet any criteria of transdifferentiation as outlined above\n   2. Progression on at least one prior androgen signaling inhibitor (e.g. abiraterone/prednisone, enzalutamide, apalutamide, darolutamide)\n   3. No prior chemotherapy for the treatment of mCRPC.

Ability to understand a written informed consent document, and the willingness to sign it\n13. Patients must agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 60 days after last administration of study treatment. Adequate contraception includes:\n\n    1. Patients who are sexually active should consider their female partner to be of childbearing potential if she has experienced menarche and is not postmenopausal (defined as amenorrhea > 24 consecutive months) or has not undergone successful surgical sterilization. Even women who use contraceptive hormones (oral, implanted, or injected), an intrauterine device, or barrier methods (diaphragms, condoms, spermicide) should be considered to be of childbearing potential\n    2. Patients who have undergone vasectomy themselves should also be considered to be of childbearing potential\n    3. Acceptable methods of contraception include continuous total abstinence, or double-barrier method of birth control (e.g. condoms used with spermicide, or condoms used with oral contraceptives). Periodic abstinence and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception\n14. Patients must be willing to undergo metastatic tumor biopsy during screening. If no metastatic lesion is safely accessible to tumor biopsy, this requirement will be waived. Bone or soft tissue lesion is allowed, but soft tissue will be prioritized.
