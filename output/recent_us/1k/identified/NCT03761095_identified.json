Received any systemic anticancer therapy including investigational agents <=3 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment. Additionally, Participants may have not received radiation </= 3 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment.\n2. Co-existing active infection or any co-existing medical condition likely to interfere with study procedures, including:\n\n   a. Significant cardiovascular disease (New York Heart Association Class III or IV cardiac disease), myocardial infarction within the past 6 months, unstable angina, congestive heart failure requiring therapy, unstable arrhythmia or a need for anti-arrhythmic therapy, or evidence of ischemia on electrocardiogram (ECG), marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc (corrected QT interval) interval, for example, repeated demonstration of a QTc interval >500 milliseconds (msec) (Long QT Syndrome [congenital]).\n3. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), or hepatitis C virus (HCV) positivity.\n4. History of solid organ transplantation.\n\n   Therapeutics:\n5. Known or suspected allergy or immediate or delayed hypersensitivity to unesbulin or dacarbazine or any agent given in this study.\n\n   Gastrointestinal:\n6. Bowel obstruction, malabsorption, or other contraindication to oral medication.\n7. Gastrointestinal disease or other condition that could affect absorption.\n8. Active peptic ulcer disease.\n9. Inflammatory bowel disease (including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease), diverticulitis, cholecystitis, symptomatic cholangitis or appendicitis.\n10. Any condition that impairs participant's ability to swallow oral medications.\n\n    Wounds /Surgery:\n11. Serious non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fractures.\n12. Major surgery, open biopsy or significant traumatic injury which has not recovered in the opinion of the investigator, within 28 days of baseline.\n13. Mucosal or internal bleeding.\n\n    Concomitant Medications:\n14. Concomitant strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor [SSRI] agents fluvoxamine and fluoxetine) should be avoided. CYP1A2 inhibitors may inhibit the conversion of dacarbazine to its active metabolite and may increase the exposure of unesbulin.\n\n    Other:\n15. Prior malignancies other than LMS, that required treatment or have shown evidence of recurrence (except for non-melanoma skin cancer or adequately treated cervical carcinoma in situ) during the 5 years prior to initiation. Cancer treated with curative intent more than 5 years previously and without evidence of recurrence is not an exclusion.\n16. Known coagulopathy or bleeding diathesis. Participants on anti-coagulation should be monitored closely and International Normalized Ratio (INR) within normal range.\n17. Prior or ongoing clinically significant illness, medical or psychiatric condition, medical history, physical findings, ECG findings, or laboratory abnormality that, in the investigator's opinion, could affect the safety of the participant, or alter the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of the study drugs, or could impair the assessment of study results.\n18. History of brain metastases or leptomeningeal disease at any time in participant's history, including treated central nervous system (CNS) disease which is clinically and radiographically stable.",
