Patients with BRCA1/2 mutations must have received prior treatment with a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor to be eligible. Platinum-resistance is defined as any of the following occurring < 183 days after the last dose of platinum-based chemotherapy:\n\n  * Development of measurable disease (per RECIST 1.1)\n  * Progression of radiographic disease (per RECIST 1.1)\n  * Increase in CA-125 level to ≥ 2 x upper limit of normal (ULN) (if within normal limits [WNL] at the completion of platinum-based chemotherapy)\n  * Increase in CA-125 level to ≥ 2 x nadir (if nadir > ULN)\n  * If CA-125 is used to determine the date of progression then it must be confirmed by a second CA-125 value ≥ 7 days after the first level and concurrent with imaging changes. The date of the first qualifying CA-125 is used to compute the platinum-free interval\n* PRE-REGISTRATION: Provide written informed consent\n* PRE-REGISTRATION: Willingness to provide mandatory blood specimens and biopsy tissue for correlative research\n* REGISTRATION: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 0 or 1\n* REGISTRATION: Histologically confirmed surgical diagnosis of epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, carcinosarcoma, or primary peritoneal cancer with measurable disease.

EXCEPTIONS: Non-melanotic skin cancer or carcinoma-in-situ of the cervix.
