Documentation of CD19 expression on malignant cells by flow cytometry/IHC from a CLIA certified laboratory\n\n   NHL Patients: Within 6 months of physician-investigator confirmation of eligibility as long as there has been no intervening CD19 directed therapy since expression confirmed. Results outside of this window may be used, if there is no accessible tumor site and the subject did not receive intervening CD19 directed therapy since CD19 expression was confirmed.\n\n   CLL and ALL Patients: At time of most recent relapse. If the subject has subsequently received CD19-directed therapy since this result was obtained, repeating testing must be performed to determine eligibility.\n3. Patients with relapsed disease after prior allogeneic SCT must meet the following criteria:\n\n   a. Have no active GVHD and require no immunosuppression b. Are more than 6 months from transplant at the time of physician-investigator confirmation of eligibility\n4. Adequate organ function defined as:\n\n   a. Creatinine ≤ 1.6 mg/dl b. ALT/AST ≤ 3x upper limit of normal range c. Direct bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dl, unless the subject has Gilbert's syndrome (≤3.0 mg/dl) d.

ALL Patients (Cohorts C and D): i. Patients with b-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Note: Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) lymphoid blast crisis is considered a sub-type of relapsed B-ALL, thus will be encompassed in our definition of B-ALL throughout; AND ii. Patients with 2nd or greater relapse or refractory disease as defined by one of the following criteria:\n\n1. Recurrent disease in the blood or bone marrow identified morphologically, by IHC or flow; OR\n2. Isolated CNS disease.

Recurrent extramedullary disease at other (non-CNS) sites if disease response can be assessed radiographically. Note: Patients with recurrent extramedullary disease do not need to have detectable blood or bone marrow involvement; OR\n4. Any relapse after allogeneic SCT; OR\n5. Patients with refractory disease as defined by one of the following:\n\n   1. Failure to achieve remission (<5% bone marrow blasts or ongoing extramedullary or CNS disease) after 2 cycles of induction chemotherapy; OR\n   2. Patients that achieve remission but remain MRD+ after ≥2 cycles of induction chemotherapy.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",

CNS disease as defined by disease-cohort as follows:\n\n   1. NHL/CLL Patients: Active CNS disease. Note: Patients with a history of CNS involvement that was successfully treated are eligible. A CNS evaluation is only required for eligibility if a subject is experiencing signs/symptoms of CNS involvement.\n   2. ALL Patients: CNS3 disease that is progressive on therapy, or with CNS parenchymal lesions that might increase the risk of CNS toxicity.\n9. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women.\n10.
