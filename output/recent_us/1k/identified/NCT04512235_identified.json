Echocardiogram demonstrating a mean left ventricular wall thickness (calculated as [IVSd+LPWd]/2) of > 12 mm at diastole in the absence of other causes (e.g., severe hypertension, aortic stenosis), which would adequately explain the degree of wall thickening or iii.

Anemia: hemoglobin value of > 20 g/L below the lowest limit of normal, or a hemoglobin value < 100 g/L OR iv. Bone lesions: one or more osteolytic lesion on imaging tests (performed ≤ 3 months prior to signing the ICF): skeletal radiography, computed tomography (CT), or positron emission tomography (PET)/CT, or MRI. If bone marrow has < 10% clonal plasma cells, more than one bone lesion is required to distinguish from solitary plasmacytoma with minimal marrow involvement OR b. Any one of the following biomarkers of malignancy: i. 60% or greater clonal plasma cells on bone marrow examination OR ii. More than one focal lesion on MRI that is at least 5 mm or greater in size\n* Have supine systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg or symptomatic orthostatic hypotension, defined as a decrease in systolic blood pressure upon standing of > 30 mmHg despite medical management (e.g., midodrine, fludrocortisones) in the absence of volume depletion",
