Patients with a CD4+ count of > 300 and an undetectable viral load who are currently on HAART are eligible for inclusion\n  2. Patients with NYHA class III or IV congestive heart failure within 6 months of study treatment will be excluded\n* Pregnant women and women who are breast-feeding.\n* History or evidence of symptomatic autoimmune disease in past 2 years prior to enrollment.\n\n  a.
