Note: prior anti-CD20 antibody use is permitted within the washout period if a subsequent disease response assessment indicates disease progression\n  * Within 8 weeks: prior tabelecleucel (>8 weeks prior to enrollment) is permitted if response was obtained or if usual protocol-directed therapeutic options were not exhausted, for cellular therapies (chimeric antigen receptor therapies directed at T-cells or T-cell subsets, donor lymphocyte infusion, other CTLs or virus-specific T-cells); and/or therapies which could impact tabelecleucel function (anti-thymocyte globulin, alemtuzumab)\n  * Any prior treatment with EBV-CTLs with the exception of tabelecleucel as above\n* Women who are breastfeeding or pregnant\n* Unwilling to comply with protocol specified contraceptive/reproductive restrictions from enrollment through 90 days after the last treatment\n* Ongoing need for daily steroids of > 0.5 mg/kg prednisone or glucocorticoid equivalent, ongoing methotrexate, or extracorporeal photopheresis (for participants with CNS disease, protocol-specified dexamethasone is permitted and concludes by the time of enrollment)\n* Any conditions that may put the study outcomes at undue risk (life expectancy < 60 days or any life-threatening illness, medical condition, or organ system dysfunction)\n* For participants with PID LPD or AID LPD: history of prior allogeneic HCT or solid organ transplant\n* For participants with EBV+ PTLD: prior systemic therapy for PTLD",
