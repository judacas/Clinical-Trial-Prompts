A participant with any gastrointestinal disease that would impair ability to swallow, retain, or absorb drug is not eligible.\n* Female participants of childbearing potential (defined as a sexually mature woman who has not undergone surgical sterilization or who has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months for women > 55 years of age) must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required.\n* Female participants of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate methods of contraception starting with the first dose of study therapy through 60 days after the last dose of study therapy.\n\n  * Participants of childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not been free from menses for > 1 year without an alternative medical cause.\n* Male participants must agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting with the first dose of study therapy through 60 days after the last dose of study therapy.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
        "exclusion_criteria": "* Prior therapeutic intervention with any of the following:\n\n  * Therapeutic anticancer antibodies within 4 weeks;\n  * Radio- or toxin-immunoconjugates within 10 weeks;\n  * Inhibitors of Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) (e.g., ibrutinib), BH3-mimetic venetoclax, lenalidomide and other \"targeted\" therapy - within 6 half-lives (i.e., 36 hours for ibrutinib)\n  * All other chemotherapy, radiation therapy within 3 weeks prior to initiation of therapy.\n  * PI3K inhibitors (idelalisib, copanlisib or any investigational PI3K inhibitor including duvelisib and umbralisib) at any time.\n* Any adverse event related to prior therapy that has not recovered to grade =< 1.\n* Chronic use of corticosteroids in excess of prednisone 30 mg/day or its equivalent.\n* Allogeneic stem cell transplant within the past 12 months, or ongoing immunosuppressive therapy other than prednisone =< 10 mg/day (or equivalent).\n* Use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers, in the one week prior to initiating study treatment or concomitant.\n* Unable to receive prophylactic treatment for pneumocystis, herpes simplex virus (HSV), or herpes zoster (varicella zoster virus [VZV]) at screening.\n* History of prior malignancy except:\n\n  * Malignancy treated with curative intent and no known active disease present for >= 2 years prior to initiation of therapy on current study;\n  * Adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer or lentigo maligna (melanoma in situ) without evidence of disease;\n  * Adequately treated in situ carcinomas (e.g., breast, cervical, esophageal, etc.) without evidence of disease;\n  * Asymptomatic prostate cancer managed with \"watch and wait\" strategy\n* Uncontrolled immune hemolysis or thrombocytopenia (positive direct antiglobulin test in absence of hemolysis or history of immune-mediated cytopenias are not exclusions).\n* History of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or active hepatitis B or C.\n* History of chronic liver disease.\n* Major surgery (requiring general anesthesia) within 2 weeks prior to initiation of therapy.\n* Patients with clinically significant medical condition of malabsorption, inflammatory bowel disease, chronic conditions which manifest with diarrhea, refractory nausea, vomiting or any other condition that will interfere significantly with drug absorption.\n* History of stroke, unstable angina, myocardial infarction, or ventricular arrhythmia requiring medication or a pacemaker within the last 6 months prior to screening.\n* Baseline QT interval corrected with Fridericia's method (QTcF) > 500 ms.
