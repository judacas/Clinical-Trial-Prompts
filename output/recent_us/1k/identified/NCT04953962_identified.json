Patients with pathologically confirmed stage IV exocrine pancreatic cancer who have received at least two lines of systemic therapy for metastatic disease. Up to 10 of prior lines of systemic therapy (including prior cisplatin), chemoradiotherapy, radiotherapy or investigational agents the patient has received are allowed in order to be eligible, as long as all eligibility criteria are met, with the exception that a patient must not have received more than two prior lines incorporating anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-CTLA-4 immune checkpoint blockade.\n\n   Patients who have received prior anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-CTLA-4 immune checkpoint blockade therapy must have tolerated therapy with no evidence of grade 4 toxicity or an immune-related event (any grade) that required treatment discontinuation. Patients who experienced an endocrine related dysfunction are eligible, provided they are on stable hormone replacement therapy;\n3. Male or female patients aged ≥ 18 years at time of informed consent;\n4. ECOG Performance Status (PS) 0-1;\n5. Life expectancy > 3 months;\n6.

Adequate bone marrow reserve, cardiac, liver, renal and metabolic function:\n\n   * white blood cell count (WBC) <10,000/mm3;\n   * absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,500/mm3;\n   * platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3;\n   * hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL;\n   * creatinine phosphokinase isozymes CPK-MB and CPK-MM ≤ upper limit of normal (ULN);\n   * serum troponin T levels within normal limits;\n   * bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN;\n   * alanine aminotransferase (ALT, SGPT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST, SGOT) ≤ 2.5 x ULN (≤ 5 x ULN if liver metastases are present);\n   * INR ≤ 1.5 x ULN;\n   * serum creatinine ≤ ULN or creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min (by Cockcroft & Gault formula or alternate calculation by 24hr urine collection). Patients with serum creatinine ≤ ULN and clearance between 45 to 59 mL/min should reduce cisplatin dose by 50%;\n   * serum potassium ≥ 3.0 and ≤ 5.5 mmol/L;\n   * serum calcium ≥ 8.0 and ≤ 11.5 mg/dL (≥ 2.0 and ≤ 2.9 mmol/L);\n   * serum magnesium ≥ 1.2 and ≤ 3.0 mg/dL (≥ 0.5 and ≤ 1.23 mmol/L);\n8. Female patients of child-bearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test and use at least one form of contraception as approved by the investigator for 4 weeks prior to initiating study treatment and for 14 months after the last dose of study drug . For the purposes of this study, child-bearing potential is defined as \"all female patients unless they are post-menopausal for at least 3 years or surgically sterile;\n9. Male patients must use a form of barrier contraception approved by the investigator during the study and for 14 months after the last dose of study drug.\n10.

Any previous history of another malignancy (other than cured basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or cured in-situ carcinoma) within 5 years of study entry;\n5. Presence of any significant central nervous system (CNS) or psychiatric disorder(s) that would hamper the patient's compliance;\n6. Evidence of peripheral neuropathy grade ≥ 2;\n7. Treatment with any other investigational agent or participation in another clinical trial within 28 days prior to study entry;\n8. Pregnant or breast-feeding patients or any patient with child-bearing potential not using adequate contraception;\n9. Known HIV, HBV, or HCV infection (excluding cured HBV and/or cured HCV infection);\n10. Active CNS metastases; however, patients with CNS metastases will be eligible if they have been treated and are stable without symptoms for 4 weeks after completion of treatment, with image documentation required, and must be off steroids;\n11. Who require chronic systemic steroid therapy or on any other form of immunosuppressive medication;\n12. Has received a live-virus vaccination within 30 days of planned treatment start;\n13. With known risk factors for bowel perforation, i.e., history of diverticulitis, intra-abdominal abscess, intestinal obstruction, or abdominal carcinomatosis;\n14. Has an active autoimmune disease or a documented history of autoimmune disease;\n15. Has a history pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease.\n16.
