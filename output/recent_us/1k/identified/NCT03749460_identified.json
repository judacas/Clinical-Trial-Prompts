If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required\n* Female subjects of childbearing potential should be willing to use 1 method of highly effective birth control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course of the study through 180 days after the last dose of study medication. Subjects of childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not been free from menses for > 1 year\n* Male subjects should agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting with the first dose of study therapy through 180 days after the last dose of study therapy\n* Patient is >= 5 years free of another primary malignancy, except:\n\n  * If the other malignancy is basal cell carcinoma or cervical carcinoma in situ or\n  * If the other primary malignancy is not considered clinically significant and is requiring no active intervention\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
