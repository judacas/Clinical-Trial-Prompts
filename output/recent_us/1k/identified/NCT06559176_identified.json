Contraindication to mobilization and apheresis, including severe allergic reaction to receipt of any medication or other drug substance required for mobilization and apheresis (e.g., G-CSF, plerixafor) or PM359 manufacture (e.g., DMSO).\n  2. Contraindication to receipt of the conditioning agent, busulfan.\n* Positive for presence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 or HIV-2, or active infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV), or hepatitis C virus (HCV).\n* Inadequate organ function, including known chronic advanced end-organ damage which in the opinion of the investigator would put the participant at risk for undergoing HSCT\n* Prior or current malignancy or myeloproliferative disorder (excluding Stage 1 or lower, fully treated/excised malignant and pre-malignant disease of the skin, cervix or colon).\n* Any other condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may compromise the safety or compliance of the participant or would preclude the participant from successful study completion, including Participant/Parent/Guardian unable or unwilling to comply with the protocol requirements.\n* Pregnancy or breastfeeding in a postpartum female or absence of adequate contraception for fertile participants. Females of childbearing potential and non-sterile male participants who are or may become sexually active with female partners of childbearing potential are required to use highly effective contraception from Screening through at least 12 months after drug product infusion.\n* Participation in another clinical study with an investigational drug within 30 days of Screening or at least 5 times the half-life of the investigational drug (whichever is longer), or any prior receipt of gene therapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplant.",
