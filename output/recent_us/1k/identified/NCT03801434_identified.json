Subjects with a known history of hepatitis B and/or C are allowed on trial if at the time of enrollment, the virus is not active and undetected (testing required if there is a known history), and such patients are not actively receiving antiviral treatment specific for hepatitis B and/or C.\n* Clinically serious infections requiring ongoing antibiotic therapy.\n* Parasitic infection diagnosed within 24 weeks prior to enrollment.\n* Platelet count =< 25 x 10^9/L at baseline.\n* Alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) > 4 x upper limit of normal (ULN) or direct bilirubin > 4 x ULN (if considered to be unrelated to the underlying eosinophilic disorder).\n* End-stage renal function (creatinine clearance [CrCl] < 15 mL/min or glomerular filtration rate [GFR] < 15 mL/min) regardless of whether hemodialysis is required.\n* Use of investigational or commercial therapies with the intent to treat the underlying eosinophilic disorder within 28 days of study start, including interferon; imatinib; alemtuzumab; cyclosporine; methotrexate; mepolizumab; benralizumab; or other antibody therapies.\n* Use of hydroxyurea within 7 days of study start.\n* Prior therapy with ruxolitinib or other JAK inhibitors.\n* Previous allergic reactions to JAK inhibitors or excipients.\n* Unwilling to commit to abstinence from heterosexual contact or agree to use and comply with highly effective contraception, 28 days prior to starting study drug, during the treatment period and for 12 weeks after discontinuation of study treatment.\n* Females of childbearing potential who have a positive pregnancy test (urine or serum) during screening period.",
