Have a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) >45% by echocardiogram (ECHO) or multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan\n  9. Be nonfertile or agree to use an adequate method of contraception. Sexually active patients and their partners must use an effective method of contraception associated with a low failure rate prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for at least 6 months after the last dose of study drug.\n  10. Be able to comply with the requirements of the entire study.\n  11. Provide written informed consent prior to any study related procedure. (In the event that the patient is re-screened for study participation or a protocol amendment alters the care of an ongoing patient, a new informed consent form must be signed.)\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 65 Years",

Hydroxyurea is allowed up to the evening before starting (but not within 12 hours) of starting Induction therapy.\n  4. Received >200 mg/m2 equivalents of daunorubicin\n  5. Have a peripheral blast count of >30,000/mm3 (may use hydroxyurea as in #3 above)\n  6. Have active central nervous system (CNS) leukemia\n  7. Have evidence of uncontrolled disseminated intravascular coagulation\n  8. Have an active, uncontrolled infection\n  9. Have other life-threatening illness\n  10. Have other active malignancies or diagnosed with other malignancies within the last 6 months, except nonmelanoma skin cancer or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia\n  11.
