        "inclusion_criteria": "For inclusion in the study subjects should fulfil the following criteria:\n\n1. Provision of signed and dated, written informed consent prior to any study specific procedures.\n2. Healthy male subjects with suitable veins for cannulation or repeated venipuncture: non Japanese male subjects aged 18 to 65 years (inclusive).\n3. Have a body mass index between 18 and 30 kg/m2 inclusive and weigh at least 50 kg and no more than 100 kg inclusive.\n4. Alanine aminotransferase, AST and total bilirubin less than or equal to the upper limit of normal for the institution.\n5. Have a calculated creatinine clearance greater than 80 mL/min using the Cockcroft-Gault formula at screening.\n6. Provision of signed, written and dated informed consent for optional genetic/biomarker research. If a subject declines to participate in the genetic component of the study, there will be no penalty or loss of benefit to the subject. The subject will not be excluded from other aspects of the study described in this clinical study protocol.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be MALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 65 Years",
        "exclusion_criteria": "Subjects will not enter the study if any of the following exclusion criteria are fulfilled:\n\n1. Healthy subjects of Japanese ethnicity and any healthy subject that has 1 parent or grandparent (maternal or paternal) of Japanese ethnicity.\n2. History of any clinically significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator (PI), may either put the volunteer at risk because of participation in the study, or influence the results or the volunteer's ability to participate in the study.\n3. History or presence of gastrointestinal, hepatic or renal disease, or any other condition known to interfere with absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of drugs.\n4. Any clinically significant illness, medical/surgical procedure, or trauma within 4 weeks of the first administration of investigational medicinal product (IMP).\n5. Planned in-patient surgery, dental procedure or hospitalization during the study.\n6. Any clinically significant abnormalities in clinical chemistry, haematology, or urinalysis results, as judged by the PI.\n7. Any positive result on screening for serum hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody, and human immunodeficiency virus antibody.\n8. Abnormal vital signs, after 5 minutes supine rest, defined as any of the following:\n\n(1) Systolic BP < 90 mmHg or ≥ 140 mmHg (2) Diastolic BP < 50 mmHg or ≥ 90 mmHg (3) Heart rate < 45 or > 85 beats per minute. 9 Any clinically important abnormalities in rhythm, conduction or morphology of the 12 lead resting ECG that may interfere with the interpretation of QTc interval changes. These include healthy subjects with any of the following:\n\n1. Abnormal ST-T-wave morphology, particularly in the protocol defined primary lead (V2) or left ventricular hypertrophy.\n2. PR interval shortening < 120 ms (PR > 110 ms but < 120 ms is acceptable if there is no evidence of ventricular pre-excitation).\n3. PR interval prolongation (> 200 ms). Intermittent second (Type 1 second degree block [Wenckebach Phenomenon] while asleep is not exclusive]) or third degree atrioventricular (AV) block, or AV dissociation.\n4. Persistent or intermittent complete bundle branch block, incomplete bundle branch block, or intraventricular conduction delay with QRS > 110 ms. Subjects with QRS > 110 ms but < 115 ms are acceptable if there is no evidence of e.g., ventricular hypertrophy or pre-excitation.\n5. Mean resting correct QT interval (QTcF) > 450 ms for men on screening obtained from 3 ECGs or history or factors that may increase the risk of QTcF prolongation such as chronic hypokalaemia not correctable with supplements, congenital or familial long QT syndrome, or family history of unexplained sudden death under 40 years of age in first-degree relatives or any concomitant medication known to prolong the QT interval and cause Torsade de Pointes (TdP).\n\n10 Known or suspected history of drug abuse, as judged by the PI. 11 Current smokers or those who have smoked or used nicotine products within the previous 30 days.\n\n12 History of alcohol abuse or excessive intake of alcohol as judged by the PI. 13 Excessive intake of caffeine-containing drinks or food (e.g., coffee, tea, chocolate,) as judged by the PI.\n\n14 Use of drugs with enzyme inducing properties such as St John's Wort within 3 weeks prior to the first administration of the IMP.\n\n15 Any intake of grapefruit, grapefruit juice, Seville oranges, Seville orange marmalade, or other products containing grapefruit or Seville oranges within 7 days of the first admission on Day -1.\n\n16 Use of any prescribed or non-prescribed medication including antacids, analgesics (other than use of ibuprofen up to 72 hours before dosing day), herbal remedies, megadose vitamins (intake of 20 to 600 times the recommended daily dose) and minerals during the 2 weeks before the first administration of the IMP or longer (5 times the half-life) if the medication has a long half-life. No medications known to prolong the QT/QTc interval and cause TdP are allowed.\n\n17 Positive screen for drugs of abuse, cotinine (nicotine) and/or alcohol at screening and at admission to the Study Centre (Day -1 [Period 1] and Day 14 [Period 2]) to the Study Centre.\n\n18 History of severe allergy/hypersensitivity or ongoing clinically important allergy/hypersensitivity, as judged by the PI.\n\n19 History of severe allergy/hypersensitivity or ongoing clinically important allergy/hypersensitivity, as judged by the PI or history of hypersensitivity to drugs with a similar chemical structure or class to savolitinib or rifampicin.\n\n20 Plasma donation within 1 month of screening or any blood donation/blood loss > 500 mL during the 3 months prior to screening.\n\n21 Has received another new chemical entity (defined as a compound which has not been approved for marketing) within 3 months of the first administration of IMP in this study. The period of exclusion begins 3 months after the final dose or 1 month after the last visit whichever is the longest.\n\nNote: subjects consented and screened, but not enrolled in this study or a previous phase I study, are not excluded.\n\n22 Involvement of any AstraZeneca, Parexel or study site employee or their close relatives 23 Subjects who have previously received savolitinib. 24 Judgment by the PI that the subject should not participate in the study if they have any ongoing or recent (i.e., during the screening period) minor medical complaints that may interfere with the interpretation of study data or are considered unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions, and requirements.\n\n25 Subjects who are vegans, vegetarians or have medical dietary restrictions and who are lactose intolerant.\n\n26 Subjects who cannot communicate reliably with the PI. 27 Vulnerable subjects, e.g., kept in detention, protected adults under guardianship, trusteeship, or committed to an institution by governmental or juridical order.\n\n28 Subjects who wear soft contact lenses, unless the subject is prepared to refrain from wearing soft lenses throughout Period 2 until after the last PK sample collection in Period 3.",
