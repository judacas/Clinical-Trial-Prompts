        "exclusion_criteria": "A subject will be not eligible for inclusion in this study if any of the following criteria apply:\n\n1. Received anticancer therapy including cytotoxic chemotherapy, biological products and investigational agents, ≤ 21 days prior to first dose of FWD1509 MsOH; or received prior EGFR TKIs (e.g., gefitinib, erlotinib or osimertinib) ≤7 days prior to the first dose FWD1509 MsOH\n2. Have been diagnosed with another primary malignancy other than NSCLC except for patients with adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer, cervical cancer in situ or definitively treated non-metastatic prostate cancer, or participants with another primary malignancy who are definitively relapse-free with at least 3 years elapsed since the diagnosis of the other primary malignancy\n3. Received radiotherapy ≤14 days prior to the first dose of FWD1509 MsOH or have not recovered from radiotherapy-related toxicities; palliative radiation administered outside the chest and brain, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), and stereotactic body radiotherapy are allowed up to 7 days prior to the first dose of FWD1509 MsOH\n4. Received strong CYP3A inhibitors and inducers within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of FWD1509 MsOH; they should be discontinued at least 2 weeks prior to the first dose of FWD1509 MsOH and avoided throughout the study duration (see Appendix 6)\n5. Received concomitant medications (e.g., statins) which are substrates of BCRP, p-glycoprotein or OATP1B1/1B3 (dose escalation part of phase 1 study)\n6. Have undergone major surgery within 28 days prior to first dose of FWD1509 MsOH. Minor surgical procedures, such as catheter placement or minimally invasive biopsy, are allowed\n7. Brain Metastasis: Have known active brain metastases (have either previously untreated intracranial CNS metastases or previously treated intracranial CNS metastases with radiologically documented new or progressing CNS lesions), except for the following conditions\n\n   1. Brain metastases are allowed if they have been treated with surgery and/or radiation and have been stable without requiring corticosteroids to control symptoms within 7 days before the first dose of FWD1509 MsOH and have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases\n   2. Requiring corticosteroids to control symptoms within 7 days prior to the first dose of FWD1509 MsOH or during study period; patients previously treated for CNS metastases who are clinically stable, have no new lesions, and who do not need treatment with a corticosteroid within the 7 days before the first dose of FWD1509 MsOH and during study period are allowed to be enrolled\n8. Have current spinal cord compression (symptomatic or asymptomatic and detected by radiographic imaging) or leptomeningeal disease (symptomatic or asymptomatic)\n9. Have significant, uncontrolled, or active cardiovascular disease\n10. QCc-related criteria:\n\n    1. A marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval (e.g., repeated demonstration of a QTc interval >480 milliseconds (ms) (CTCAE grade 1) using Fredericia's QT correction formula\n    2. A history of additional risk factors for Torsades de Pointes (TdP) (e.g., heart failure, hypokalemia, family history of Long QT Syndrome\n11. Have significant, uncontrolled, or active renal disease\n12. Have a known history of uncontrolled hypertension (per institution practice); participants with hypertension should be under treatment on study entry to control blood pressure\n13. Have any abnormal changes in the cornea or retina that may increase the risk of ocular toxicity during screening\n14. Have an ongoing or active infection, including but not limited to, the requirement for intravenous (IV) antibiotics, or a known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), or hepatitis C virus (HCV). Testing is not required in the absence of history\n15. Currently have or have a history of interstitial lung disease, radiation pneumonitis that required steroid treatment, or drug-related pneumonitis\n16. Female participants who are lactating and breastfeeding or have a positive urine or serum pregnancy test during the screening period\n17. Have gastrointestinal illness or disorder that could affect oral absorption of FWD1509 MsOH\n18. Have any condition or illness that, in the opinion of the investigator, might compromise participant safety or interfere with the evaluation of the safety of the drug",
