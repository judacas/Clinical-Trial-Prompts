Male or female, aged >=18 years.\n2. Patients with established thyroid cancer diagnosis presenting with either:\n\n   1. Locally advanced or distant metastases, which are RAI-non-avid based on the [123]I or [131]I diagnostic or post-treatment whole body scan (WBS) OR\n   2. Patients with RAI-non-responsive disease, who have the evidence of disease progression defined by RECIST 1.1 criteria after therapy with RAI.\n\nIn order to be eligible to participate in this study, an individual with MTC must meet all of the following criteria:\n\n1. Male or female, aged >=18 years.\n2. Patients with locally advanced or metastatic MTC or patients suspected of locally advanced or metastatic MTC with calcitonin level > 500 pg/mL.\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\nSubjects with either HTC, DTC, or MTC who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation in this study:\n\n1. Pregnancy or lactation by self-report.\n2.
