Subjects with clinically relevant ongoing complications from prior surgery are not eligible.\n  * Corrected QT interval calculated by Fridericia formula (QTcF) >500 ms per electrocardiogram (ECG) within 14 days before first dose of study treatment [add reference for Fridericia formula]. NOTE: If a single ECG shows a QTcF with an absolute >500 ms, two additional ECGs at intervals of approximately 3 min must be performed within 30 min after the initial ECG, and the average of these three consecutive results for QTcF will be used to determine eligibility.\n  * Any other active malignancy at time of first dose of study treatment or diagnosis of another malignancy within 3 years prior to first dose of study treatment that requires active treatment, except for locally curable cancers that have been apparently cured, such as basal or squamous cell skin cancer or superficial bladder cancer.\n* Known allergy to any of the compounds under investigation.\n* Inability to swallow tablets.",
