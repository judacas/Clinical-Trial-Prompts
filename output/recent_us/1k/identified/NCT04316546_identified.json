Total bilirubin <=2 x upper limit of normal (ULN)\n2. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) <=3 x ULN\n\nRenal:\n\n1. Serum creatinine depending on age:\n\n   2-5 years male and female: <=0.50 mg/dL\n\n   6-10 years male and female: <=0.59 mg/dL\n\n   11-15 years male and female: <=1.2 mg/dL\n\n   >15 years male and female: <=1.5 mg/dL\n\n   Metabolic (lipids):\n   * Cholesterol: <=400 mg/dL (<=10.34 mmol/L)\n   * Triglyceride: <=500 mg/dL (<=5.7 mmol/L)\n   * If a female is of child-bearing potential, documentation of a negative pregnancy test is required prior to enrollment.

The CCTN is defined as a nevus with at least two gyri and three sulci affecting 10% - 70% of the total surface area of the foot.\n\n   -Male or female participants age greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to 16 years old and BSA of greater than or equal to 0.33 m^2\n\n   Cohort 2 (Proteus syndrome without plantar CCTN) specific criteria:\n   * Individuals without an evaluable plantar CCTN\n   * No prior exposure to miransertib\n   * Male or female participants age >=3 years old and BSA of >=0.33 m^2\n\n   Cohort 3 (Proteus syndrome previously treated with miransertib) specific criteria:\n\n   -Participants previously treated with miransertib or currently receiving miransertib under Compassionate Use/Expanded Access or an existing trial (i.e., 16-HG-0014)\n\n   -Male or female participants greater than or equal to 3 years old BSA of greater than or equal to 0.33 m^2\n\n   Note: All participants must meet Cohort-related age criteria by/on the date of the first dose, Cycle 1 Day 1\n\n   EXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\n   An individual who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation in this study:\n\n   - History of Type 1 or Type 2 uncontrolled diabetes mellitus requiring regular medication (other than metformin or other oral hypoglycemic agents) or fasting glucose greater than or equal to 160 mg/dL ( if >12 years old) and greater than or equal to 180 mg/dL (if less than or equal to 12 years old) at the baseline/screening visit\n\n   -History of clinically significant cardiac disorders:\n\n   --Myocardial infarction (MI) or congestive heart failure defined as Class II-IV per the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification within six months of the first dose of miransertib (MI occurring >6 months of the first dose of miransertib will be permitted)\n\n   --Grade 2 (per National Cancer Institute [NCI] Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE v 5.0]) or worse conduction defect (e.g., right or left bundle branch block).\n\n   -Major surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or immunotherapy within four weeks of the first dose of miransertib\n   * Any experimental systemic therapy for the purpose of treating Proteus syndrome (e.g., sirolimus, everolimus, high dose steroids, alpelisib) within two weeks of the first dose of miransertib, except for participants who were previously or are currently treated with miransertib under a Compassionate Use/Expanded Access program or existing protocol\n\n     * Participants who were previously treated with or currently are receiving miransertib will be enrolled on Cohort 3 and treated according to the Schedule of Assessments/Study Visits defined in this protocol\n   * Intolerance of, or severe toxicity attributed to, AKT inhibitors (e.g., miransertib, uprosertib, afuresertib, ipatasertib)\n   * Concurrent severe uncontrolled illness not related to Proteus syndrome\n\n     * Ongoing or active infection\n     * Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection malabsorption syndrome\n     * Psychiatric illness/substance abuse/social situation that would limit compliance with study requirements\n   * Pregnant or breastfeeding (contraception requirements can be found above and in the informed consent form)\n   * Inability to comply with study evaluations or to follow drug administration guidelines\n   * Concomitant use of a prohibited medication\n   * Regular tobacco use and/or use of cannabidiol/tetrahydrocannabidiol (CBD/THC), and/or vaping products\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 3 Years\nMust have maximum age of 99 Years",
