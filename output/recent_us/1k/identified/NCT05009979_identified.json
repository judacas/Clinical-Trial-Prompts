For this reason and because this agent as well as other therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for 2 months after each study PET/CT imaging. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.\n* Ability of subject to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to 18F-DCFPyL or other agents used in study.\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* Subjects with severe claustrophobia unresponsive to oral anxiolytics.\n* Other medical conditions deemed by the principal investigator (or associates) to make the subject unsafe/ineligible for protocol procedures.\n* Subjects weighing > 350 lbs (weight limit for scanner table), or unable to fit within the imaging gantry\n* Serum creatinine > 2 times the upper limit of normal\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because 18F-DCFPyL is an agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. as well as other agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
