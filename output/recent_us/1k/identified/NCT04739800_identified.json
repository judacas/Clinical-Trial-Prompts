No prior allogeneic bone marrow transplant or double umbilical cord blood transplantation (dUBCT)\n* Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive patients due to potential drug and drug interactions\n* Patients may not use any complementary or alternative medicines including natural herbal products or folk remedies as they may interfere with the effectiveness of the study treatments\n* Receipt of live attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of study treatment. Note: Patients, if enrolled, should not receive live vaccine whilst receiving study treatment and up to 30 days after the last dose of study treatment\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia (other than atrial fibrillation with controlled ventricular rate), or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements, substantially increase risk of incurring adverse events or compromise the ability of the patient to given written informed consent\n* Patients receiving any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4.

Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment\n* Active infection including tuberculosis (clinical evaluation that includes clinical history, physical examination and radiographic findings, and tuberculosis [TB] testing in line with local practice), hepatitis B (known positive hepatitis B virus [HBV] surface antigen (HBsAg) result), or hepatitis C. Patients with a past or resolved HBV infection (defined as the presence of hepatitis B core antibody [anti-HBc] and absence of HBsAg) are eligible.
