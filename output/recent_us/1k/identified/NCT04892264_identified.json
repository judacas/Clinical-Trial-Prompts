Thereafter, WOCBP participants must use one method of reliable birth control that is highly effective for a further 4 months following discontinuation of belantamab mafodotin or a further 2 months after discontinuation of daratumumab. WOCBP must also agree not to donate eggs (ova, oocytes) for the purpose of reproduction during treatment, during dose interruptions and for 28-days following the last dose of lenalidomide, or 4 months following discontinuation of belantamab mafodotin treatment, whichever is longer.\n\n        * Note: The Investigator is responsible for review of medical history, menstrual history, and recent sexual activity to decrease the risk for inclusion of a woman with an early undetected pregnancy\n* Male participants: Male participants are eligible to participate if they agree to the following from the time of first dose of study treatment until 28-days after the last dose of lenalidomide, or 6 months after the last dose of belantamab mafodotin, whichever is longer, to allow for clearance of any altered sperm:\n\n  * Refrain from donating sperm PLUS either\n  * Be abstinent from heterosexual intercourse as their preferred and usual lifestyle (abstinent on a long term and persistent basis) and agree to remain abstinent OR\n  * Must agree to use contraception/barrier as detailed below:\n\n    * Agree to use a male condom, even if they have undergone a successful vasectomy, and female partner to use an additional highly effective contraceptive method with a failure rate of < 1% per year as when having sexual intercourse with a woman of childbearing potential (including pregnant females)\n* Ability to understand the study procedures and provide written informed consent\n* Negative hepatitis B test (defined by a negative test for hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg], or antibodies to hepatitis B surface and/or core antigens [antiHBs or antiHBc])\n\n  * Note: Participants with serologic findings suggestive of HBV vaccination (antiHBs positivity as the only serologic marker) AND a known history of prior hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination do not need to be tested for HBV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Those who are PCR positive will be excluded from the study\n* Participant agrees not to use contact lenses while participating in the study\n* Willingness to provide mandatory bone marrow and blood specimens for research\n* Willing to return to enrolling institution for follow-up (during the Active Monitoring Phase of the study)\n* All prior treatment-related toxicities (defined by National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE), version 5.0) must be =< grade 1 at the time of enrolment except for alopecia\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be FEMALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",

Note: Bisphosphonates are considered to be supportive care rather than therapy and are thus allowed while on protocol treatment\n* Known to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive\n* Presence of positive hepatitis C antibody test result or positive hepatitis C ribonucleic acid (RNA) test result at screening or within 3 months prior to first dose of study treatment\n\n  * Note: Participants with positive hepatitis C antibody due to prior resolved disease can be enrolled, only if a confirmatory negative Hepatitis C RNA test is obtained\n  * Note: Hepatitis RNA testing is optional and participants with negative hepatitis C antibody test are not required to also undergo hepatitis C RNA testing\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to:\n\n  * Ongoing or active infection (defined as infection undergoing treatment)\n  * Active mucosal or internal bleeding\n  * Social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n  * Corneal epithelial disease (except for mild changes in the corneal epithelium)\n  * Known gastrointestinal disease (including difficulty swallowing) or gastrointestinal procedure that could interfere with the oral absorption or tolerance of lenalidomide or dexamethasone\n  * Unstable liver or biliary disease defined by the presence of ascites, encephalopathy, coagulopathy, hypoalbuminemia, esophageal or gastric varices, persistent jaundice, or cirrhosis.
