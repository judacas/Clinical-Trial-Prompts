NOTE: Patients with tumors that arise in the setting of chronic inflammation (Marjolin's ulcer) such as chronic wounds and/or scars are excluded.\n\n   f. NOTE: Determination of surgical resectability must be made before enrollment by the treating surgical oncologist (or ENT surgeon or equivalent).\n\n2. Male participants: A male participant must agree to use a contraception during the treatment period and for at least 120 days after the last dose of study treatment and refrain from donating sperm during this period.\n\n3.

The participant (or legally acceptable representative if applicable) provides written informed consent for the trial.\n\n   5. Have at least a single site of measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1. Lesions situated in a previously irradiated area are considered measurable if progression has been demonstrated in such lesions.\n\n   6. Willing to undergo pre-treatment biopsies.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n1. Prior archival tumor tissue sample are not permitted.\n2. Minimum tissue requirements: core (16G or 18G, 6 cores; preferred), punch or excisional biopsy of a tumor lesion that has not been previously irradiated.\n\n   7.
