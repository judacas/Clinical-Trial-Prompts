The disease is:\n\n   Cohort A (non-ALL subjects):\n   * Relapsed or refractory after ≥2 lines of therapy, including a CD20 antibody, if an indolent lymphoma.\n   * Relapsed or refractory after ≥2 lines of therapy, including ibrutinib and venetoclax, if CLL.\n   * Relapsed or refractory after ≥2 lines of therapy, including a CD20 antibody and an anthracycline, and the subject is ineligible for autologous stem cell transplantation, if an aggressive or highly aggressive lymphoma.\n   * Ineligibility for autologous stem cell transplantation includes non-responsive disease after salvage therapy and failure to mobilize stem cells for transplant.\n\n   Cohort B (ALL subjects):\n   * Relapsed or refractory after ≥2 lines of therapy.\n4. Measurable disease by current criteria (Lugano criteria for lymphomas, IWG criteria for CLL, and detectable disease for ALL).\n5. Age 3 to 75 years; subjects <18 years old will not be enrolled as the first subject on any dose level.\n6. BSA ≤2.4 m2.\n7. Bilirubin <2 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) (3 times if the subject has Gilbert syndrome).\n8. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) <5 times ULN.\n9.
