        "inclusion_criteria": "* Histological or cytological diagnosis of advanced, unresectable, and/or metastatic or relapsed/refractory solid tumor.\n\nECOG PS 0 or 1\n\n* Presence of at least 1 measurable lesion based on RECIST version 1.1 that has not been previously irradiated.\n* Documentation of mutated KRAS gene\n\n  1. PDAC, CRC, Other tumor types: Confirmed KRAS mutation, any variant\n  2. NSCLC: Confirmed KRAS mutation, any variant except previously treated G12C. If driver mutation, must have failed precision medicine therapy [eg, inhibitors of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), c-ros oncogene 1 (ROS1), and others].\n* Part 1 and Part 2a: Participant must have progressed on standard treatment(s) for which no additional, effective therapy is available.\n\n  1. PDAC (2-3L): Participants must have received and radiologically progressed on prior lines of systemic therapy for metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. If participants received prior neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy and progressed within 6 months of the last dose, then this should be considered as a prior line of systemic therapy.\n  2. NSCLC (2-3L): Participants must have received prior lines of anti-cancer treatment and progressed on at least a platinum-containing chemotherapy regimen and checkpoint inhibitor therapy; for participants with EGFR, ALK, or other genomic tumor alterations, participants must have progressed on approved therapy for these alterations.\n  3. CRC (2-3L): Participants must have had one or two prior systemic treatment regimens for mCRC. For either one or two prior treatments, these regimens must have included a fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, or irinotecan; for one prior treatment, exposure to VEGF/VEGF receptor (VEGFR) inhibitor is optional;\n  4. Other tumors: Participants, in the judgment of the investigator, must have progressed or become intolerant to all available standard therapies, or have refused such therapy.\n* Part 2b:\n\n  1. PDAC (1L) Cohort A2: Participants must not have received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Participant could have received neoadjuvant therapy, adjuvant therapy, or adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy, as long as relapse did not occur within 6 months of completing these forms of adjuvant treatment. If so, the relapse within 6 months would be considered a line of therapy; the participant would be considered 2L, and not 1L.\n  2. CRC (2-3L) Cohort B2: Participants must have had one or two prior systemic treatment regimens for mCRC. For either one or two prior treatments, these regimens must have included a fluoropyrimidine, irinotecan, oxaliplatin; for one prior treatment, exposure to a VEGF/VEGF receptor (VEGFR) inhibitor is optional.\n  3. CRC (1L) Cohort B3: Participants must not have had prior chemotherapy for advanced or metastatic disease. Participant could have received adjuvant chemotherapy or adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy, as long as relapse did not occur within 6 months of complete of adjuvant therapy. If so, the relapse within 6 months would be considered a line of therapy; the participant would be considered 2L, and not 1L.\n  4. NSCLC (1L) Cohort C2: Participants must have a TPS ≥50% and must not have received prior systemic treatment setting.\n  5. NSCLC (1L) Cohort C3: Participants with any TPS and must not have received prior systemic treatment setting.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
