Patients must have a known FET fusion (fusion that contains EWSR1, FUS, or TAF15) as documented by next generation sequencing, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Patients with a histological diagnosis of Ewing sarcoma with EWS-FLI1 are eligible for dose escalation but not for the exploratory cohort. Please note patients with Ewing sarcoma and alternative FET-ETS fusions (including but not limited to EWS-ERG, EWS-ETV1, EWS-ETV4, EWS-FEV, FUS-ERG, FUS-FEV) are eligible for the exploratory cohort.\n3. Phase 2: Histologically confirmed diagnosis of recurrent or relapsed Ewing sarcoma failing primary therapy with confirmation of EWS-FLI1 fusion and breakpoint by Next generation sequencing or PCR or EWSR1 rearrangement confirmed by FISH and available tissue for central confirmation of EWS-FLI1 fusion and breakpoint.\n4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0-2 (age ≥16 years) or Lansky of at least 60 (age <16 years).\n5.

Fertile males and females of childbearing potential must agree to use an effective method of birth control from screening, through 6 months after last study drug administration for females and 4 months for males. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test during screening procedures. Effective methods of birth control include: double barrier method (condom, diaphragm), abstinence, an intrauterine device (IUD), levonorgestrol implants, medroxyprogesterone acetate injections, or oral contraception. For those subjects whose preferred and usual lifestyle employs abstinence, refraining from heterosexual intercourse must be practiced during the entire active phase of the trial.\n9. Patients ≥18 years must be willing to undergo tumor biopsy at study entry. Patients with Ewing sarcoma or DSRCT must be willing to undergo biopsy post-treatment. If biopsy is contraindicated, enrollment must be approved by study PI and archival tissue must be available.\n10. Time elapsed from previous therapy:\n\n    1. Must be ≥ 3 weeks for systemic myelosuppressive therapy\n    2. ≥ 2 weeks for local radiation therapy (small field), ≥ 150 days after thyrotropin binding inhibition (TBI), craniospinal external beam radiotherapy (XRT) or radiation to ≥50% of the pelvis\n    3. ≥ 2 weeks for major surgery\n    4. ≥ 2 weeks for monoclonal antibodies and oral kinase inhibitors.\n    5. ≥ 6 weeks for autologous stem cell transplant. 6 months for allogeneic stem cell transplant.\n    6. ≥ 6 weeks for any type of cellular therapy\n11.

Patients receiving a medically necessary strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor or inducer within 14 days prior to the first dose of study drug.\n6. Clinically significant, unrelated illness or uncontrolled infection which would, in the opinion of the treating physician, compromise the patient's ability to tolerate the investigational agents or be likely to interfere with the study procedures or results.\n7. Subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, may not be able to comply with the safety monitoring requirements of the study, or in whom compliance is likely to be suboptimal, should be excluded.\n8.
