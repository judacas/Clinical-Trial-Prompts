Patients will be required to be extended RAS (KRAS and NRAS) and BRAF wild-type based upon central assessment.\n  * Part 2:\n  * GEA: Unresectable, locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic HER2-expressing GEA (IHC 3+, or IHC 2+ and FISH+ by central assessment)\n  * BTC: Same as Part 1\n  * CRC: Same as Part 1\n* Tumor measurements as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1:\n\n  * Part 1: Measurable or non-measurable disease\n  * Part 2: Measurable disease\n* An Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status score of 0 or 1\n* Adequate organ function\n* Adequate cardiac left ventricular function, as defined by a LVEF >/= institutional standard of normal\n\nExclusion:\n\n* Prior treatment with a HER2-targeted agent\n* Prior systemic anti-cancer therapy (including investigational products) except prior adjuvant/neoadjuvant therapy, which must be completed at least 6 months prior to first study treatment dosing. For subjects with BTC and CRC the following additional exceptions apply:\n\n  * BTC: patients may have started therapy for advanced disease but may not have received more than one cycle of any standard gemcitabine-based chemotherapy regimen.\n  * CRC: patients may have started therapy for advanced disease but may not have received more than one cycle of 5-FU-based chemotherapy (< 1 month of therapy).\n* Patients with certain contraindications to bevacizumab cannot be enrolled on the mFOLFOX6-2 with bevacizumab arm.\n* Palliative radiotherapy is allowed if completed at least 2 weeks prior to first study treatment dosing\n* Untreated known brain metastases (patients with treated brain metastases who are off steroids, off antiseizure medications, and stable for at least 1 month at the time of screening are eligible)\n* Clinically significant cardiac disease, such as ventricular arrhythmia requiring therapy, uncontrolled hypertension or any history of symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF). Patients with known myocardial infarction or unstable angina within 6 months prior to randomization are also excluded.\n* QTc Fridericia (QTcF) > 470 ms. For patients with longer QTcF on initial electrocardiogram (ECG), follow-up ECG may be performed in triplicate to determine eligibility\n* Peripheral neuropathy > Grade 1 per NCI-CTCAE v5.0\n* Clinically significant interstitial lung disease\n* Prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment has the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen\n* Active hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection or infection with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-1 or HIV-2 (Exception: patients with well controlled HIV [e.g., CD4 > 350/mm3 and undetectable viral load] are eligible)\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
