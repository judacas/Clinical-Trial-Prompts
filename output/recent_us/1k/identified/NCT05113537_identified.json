Prior treatment with at least one line of taxane-based chemotherapy administered in either the hormone sensitive or castrate-resistant setting. Patients must have recovered (CTCAE grade =< 1) from the acute effects of chemotherapy except for residual alopecia or grade 2 peripheral neuropathy prior to study entry. A washout period of at least 21 days is required between last chemotherapy dose and treatment initiation\n7.

Initial treatment must not begin earlier than the day after the erythrocyte transfusion]\n    * Platelets (Plt) > 100,000\n    * Total bilirubin =< 1.5 x the institutional upper limit of normal (ULN).

Head imaging is not required\n10. Patients with symptoms of cord compression or impending cord compression\n11. Patients with concurrent serious medical conditions as determined by primary investigator\n12. Patients with other significant malignancies that are expected to alter life expectancy or interfere with disease assessment.

Patients with history of in-situ/early stage melanoma will not be excluded\n13. Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to prior anti-cancer therapy to =< grade 1 or baseline (other than alopecia or peripheral neuropathy)\n14. Patients with serious and/or uncontrolled preexisting medical condition(s) that, in the judgment of the investigator, would preclude participation in this study (for example, interstitial lung disease, severe dyspnea at rest or requiring oxygen therapy, severe renal impairment [e.g. estimated creatinine clearance < 30ml/min], history of major surgical resection involving the stomach or small bowel, or preexisting Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis or a preexisting chronic condition resulting in baseline grade 2 or higher diarrhea)\n15.
