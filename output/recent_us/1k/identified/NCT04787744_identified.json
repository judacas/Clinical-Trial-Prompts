The results from the CT component of the PET/CT can be used to fulfill this criterion. This is optional for patients who have a PSMA PET/CT. Yechnetium (Tc99m-MDP) or sodium fluoride (NaF) bone scan (sodium fluoride preferred) performed prior to start of SST (if current SST has already started), or within 90 days prior to enrollment if not already on SST. This is optional for patients who have a PSMA PET/CT. Prostate PET/CT (currently PSMA, Fluciclovine, choline) performed prior to start of SST (if current SST has already started), or within 90 days prior to enrollment if not already on SST.\n\n1-10 lesions suspicious for nodal recurrence or metastasis from prostate cancer as determined by the investigator based on the above imaging studies.\n\nHas already undergone NPOP sequencing or a plan is in place for NPOP sequencing for prostate cancer.\n\nFor participants on SST at the time of enrollment only:\n\nHas been on SST for 180 days. For participants with local recurrence after curative-intent local therapy on imaging :\n\nPatients with local recurrence in the prostate, SV, or prostate bed are eligible as long as there is at least 1 nodal or distant metastatic recurrence. Biopsy must confirm local recurrence for patients who have had prior curative-intent radiation to the prostate, SV, or prostate bed.\n\nCandidate for salvage local therapy (refer to Section 10.4) as determined by a urologist or radiation oncologist (depending on the respective modality to be used to treat the local recurrence).\n\nFor participants with de novo prostate cancer:\n\nCandidate for prostate-directed radiation.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be MALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
