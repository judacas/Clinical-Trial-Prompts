Adequate organ function:\n\n    1. Renal: Serum creatinine </= 1.5 mg/dL or estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR using the CKI-EPI equation) >/= 45 ml/min/1.73 m2.\n    2. Hepatic: ALT/AST </= 2.5 x ULN or </= 5 x ULN if documented liver metastases, Total bilirubin </= 1.5 mg/dL, except in subjects with Gilbert's Syndrome in whom total bilirubin must be </= 3.0 mg/dL. No history of liver cirrhosis. No ascites.\n    3. Cardiac: Cardiac ejection fraction >/= 50%, no clinically significant pericardial effusion as determined by an ECHO or MUGA, and no uncontrolled arrhythmias or symptomatic cardiac disease.\n    4.

Weight ≥40 kg\n18. All participants who are able to have children must practice effective birth control while on study and up to 3 months post completion of study therapy. Acceptable forms of birth control for female patients include: hormonal birth control, intrauterine device, diaphragm with spermicide, condom with spermicide, or abstinence, for the length of the study. If the participant is a female and becomes pregnant or suspects pregnancy, she must immediately notify her doctor. If the participant becomes pregnant during this study, she will be taken off this study. Men who are able to have children must use effective birth control while on the study. If the male participant fathers a child or suspects that he has fathered a child while on the study, he must immediately notify his doctor.\n19. Signed consent to long-term follow-up protocol PA17-0483 to fulfill the institutional responsibilities to various regulatory agencies.\n20. Participants must not have received any live vaccines within 30 days prior to enrollment.\n21. No active infection requiring systemic antibiotics\n22. Adequate bone marrow function without the need for transfusion in the last 7 days as described below, unless the pancytopenia is due to marrow replacement by myeloma:\n\n    * Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1000 /µL\n    * Hemoglobin ≥8 g/dL\n    * Platelet count ≥50,000 /µL\n23. No bridging anti-myeloma therapy within 14 days of lymphodepleting therapy\n\nCriteria for Cell Infusion-\n\nPatients who meet one of the following criteria on the day of infusion will have their administration delayed for 24 hours. If these problems persist beyond 24 hours, patients will not receive their cell infusion.\n\n1. cardiac arrhythmias not controlled with medical management\n2. hypotension requiring vasopressor support\n3. suspected or active uncontrolled infection"
