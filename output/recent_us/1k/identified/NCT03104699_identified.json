        "inclusion_criteria": "1. Voluntarily agree to participate by giving written informed consent. Participation in pharmacogenomics testing is optional.\n2. Be ≥ 18 years of age.\n3. Diagnosis and prior systemic treatment:\n\n   1. Phase 1: Have a histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of a metastatic or locally advanced solid tumor for which no standard therapy is available or standard therapy has failed.\n   2. Phase 2:\n\n   I. Have (1) a histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of squamous-cell carcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma, or adenocarcinoma of the cervix, and (2) metastatic, locally advanced, and/or unresectable disease at the time of enrollment. Histologic confirmation of the original primary tumor is required via pathology report.\n\n   Note: The following cervical tumors are not eligible: minimal deviation/adenoma malignum, gastric type adenocarcinoma, clear cell carcinoma, and mesonephric carcinoma.\n\n   II. Has cervical cancer and has relapsed after a platinum-based treatment (first line) regimen for advanced (recurrent, unresectable, or metastatic) disease; Note: Subjects who have received > 1 prior systemic treatment regimen for their advanced or metastatic disease will be eligible in the following cases: Subject receiving chemotherapy concurrently with primary radiation (e.g., weekly cisplatin) or subject receiving adjuvant chemotherapy following completion of radiation therapy (e.g., paclitaxel and carboplatin for ≤ 4 cycles) and progressed within 6 months after treatment completion.\n4. Measurable disease - based on investigator assessment\n\n   1. Phase 1: Have objective evidence of disease; the presence of measurable disease is not required.\n   2. Phase 2: Have measurable disease on imaging based on RECIST version 1.1. Note: Subjects must have at least one \"target lesion\" to be used to assess response, as defined by RECIST version 1.1. Tumors within a previously irradiated field will be designated as \"non-target\" lesions unless progression is documented or a biopsy is obtained to confirm persistence at least 90 days following completion of radiation therapy.\n\n   Note: Measurable disease by RECIST 1.1 must be confirmed by independent central radiologic review prior to first dose. Subjects without centrally confirmed measurable disease at baseline will not be eligible for this trial.\n5.

Adequate hematological function defined by absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 109/L, platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L, and stable hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL (without transfusions within 1 week before first dose).\n   2. Adequate hepatic function based by a total bilirubin level ≤ the institutional upper limit of normal (IULN), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level ≤ 2.5 x IULN, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level ≤ 2.5 x IULN, and alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 x IULN.\n   3. Adequate renal function defined as creatinine ≤ 1.5 x IULN OR calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min for subjects with creatinine levels > 1.5 x IULN (if no local guideline is available, creatinine clearance should be calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault Method).\n   4. Adequate coagulation defined by international normalized ratio (INR) or prothrombin time ≤ 1.5 x IULN (unless the subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy); and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) ≤ 1.5 x IULN (unless the subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy)\n7. Other than the cancer for which the subject is enrolled, have no history of prior malignancy, with the exception of basal cell carcinoma of the skin, superficial bladder cancer, squamous-cell carcinoma of the skin, or has undergone potentially curative therapy with no evidence of that disease recurrence for 5 years since initiation of that therapy.\n8. In Phase 2, subjects must provide a sufficient and adequate formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue sample preferably from the most recent biopsy of a tumor lesion, collected either at the time of or after the diagnosis of advanced or metastatic disease has been made AND from a site not previously irradiated. If no tumor tissue is available, a fresh biopsy will be required.\n\n   Note: Tissue from needle or excisional biopsy or from resection is required.\n9. Female subjects must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening (within 72 hours before first dose of study drug) if of childbearing potential or be of non-childbearing potential. Non-childbearing potential is defined as (by other than medical reasons):\n\n   1. ≥ 45 years of age and has not menstruated for greater than 1 year,\n   2. Amenorrheic for < 2 years without a hysterectomy and oophorectomy and a follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) value in the postmenopausal range upon pretrial (screening) evaluation,\n   3. Whose status is post hysterectomy, oophorectomy or tubal ligation.\n10. If of childbearing potential, female subjects must be willing to use 2 highly effective methods (defined in the informed consent form [ICF]) throughout the study, starting with the screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of study treatment.\n\n    Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the established and preferred contraception for the subject.\n11. Male subjects with a female partner(s) of child-bearing potential must agree to use 2 highly effective methods (defined in the ICF) throughout the trial starting with the screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of study treatment is received. Males with pregnant partners must agree to use a condom; no additional method of contraception is required for the pregnant partner.\n\n    Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the established and preferred contraception for the subject.\n12. Is willing and able to comply with the requirements of the protocol.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be FEMALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",

Has clinically significant (i.e., active) cardiovascular disease: cerebral vascular accident/stroke or myocardial infarction within 6 months before enrollment, unstable angina, congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association class ≥ II), or serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication.\n16. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating Investigator.\n17. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial.\n18. Is, at the time of signing informed consent, a regular user (including \"recreational use\") of any illicit drugs or had a recent history (within the last year) of substance abuse (including alcohol).\n19.
