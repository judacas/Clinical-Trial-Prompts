These methods include the following:\n\n    * Oral, intravaginal, or transdermal combined (estrogen- and progestogen-containing) hormonal contraception associated with the inhibition of ovulation\n    * Oral, injectable, implantable progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with the inhibition of ovulation Note: Oral birth control pills are not considered a highly effective form of birth control, and if they are selected, they must be used with a second, barrier method of contraception such as condoms with or without spermicide.\n    * An intrauterine device\n    * Intrauterine hormone-releasing system\n    * Bilateral tubal occlusion\n    * Vasectomized partner Note: This is only considered a highly effective form of birth control when the vasectomized partner is the sole partner of the study participant and there has been a medical assessment confirming surgical success.\n    * A sterile male is one for whom azoospermia, in a semen sample, has been demonstrated as definitive evidence of infertility.\n    * Sexual abstinence (defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatment) Note: Total sexual abstinence should only be used as a contraceptive method if it is in line with the patients' usual and preferred lifestyle.\n\nPeriodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, sympto-thermal, postovulation methods), declaration of abstinence for the duration of exposure to study drug, and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.\n\nOf note, barrier contraception (including male and female condoms with or without spermicide) is not considered a highly effective method of contraception; if used, this method must be used in combination with one of the highly effective forms of birth control listed above.\n\n°\"Women of non-childbearing potential\" are defined as female patients meeting any of the following criteria:\n\n* Surgically sterile (ie, through bilateral salpingectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or hysterectomy)\n* Postmenopausal, defined as:\n\n  * ≥ 55 years of age with no spontaneous menses for ≥ 12 months OR\n  * < 55 years of age with no spontaneous menses for ≥ 12 months AND with postmenopausal follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) concentration > 30 IU/mL and all alternative medical causes for the lack of spontaneous menses for ≥ 12 months have been ruled out, such as polycystic ovarian syndrome, hyperprolactinemia, etc.\n  * If an FSH measurement is required to confirm postmenopausal state, concomitant use of hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy should be excluded.\n\n[Adapted from Clinical Trials Facilitation Group (CTFG) 2014.]\n\n* Nonsterile males must be willing to use a highly effective method of birth control for the duration of the study and for ≥ 120 days after the last dose of tislelizumab\n\n  •A sterile male is defined as one for whom azoospermia has been previously demonstrated in a semen sample examination as definitive evidence of infertility.\n  * Males with known \"low sperm counts\" (consistent with \"subfertility\") are not to be considered sterile.\n\n    - Demonstration of adequate organ function below within 14 days of cycle 1 day 1\n    * The ability to adhere to the study protocol and willingness to provide informed consent\n    * Cohort 1 subjects\n  * Histological confirmation of colorectal adenocarcinoma\n  * Confirmation of dMMR by immunohistochemistry\n  * Radiologically measurable metastatic disease as per RECIST 1.1, not eligible for potentially curative surgery -Cohort 2 subjects\n  * Histological confirmation of rectal adenocarcinoma\n  * Confirmation of dMMR by immunohistochemistry\n  * Rectal cancer stage II or III per AJCC 8 th edition criteria\n  * No evidence of distant metastases\n\n    * Hematological\n* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1,500 /mm^3\n* Platelets ≥100,000 / mcL\n* Hemoglobin >9 g/dL or ≥5.6 mmol/L\n\n  * Renal\n* Serum creatinine OR measured or calculated creatinine clearance (GFR can also be used in place of creatinine or CrCl) ≤1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) OR ≥30 mL/min for subject with creatinine levels > 1.5 × institutional ULN\n\n  * Hepatic\n* Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × ULN OR Direct bilirubin ≤ ULN for subjects with total bilirubin levels > 1.5 ULN\n* AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 × ULN (< 5 x ULN if hepatic metastases are present in cohort 1\n\n  * Coagulation\n* International Normalized Ratio (INR) or Prothrombin Time (PT) Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) INR <1.5 or PT <1.5 x ULN; and either PTT or aPTT <1.5 x ULN.
