Adjuvant hormonal therapy for breast cancer is allowed.\n* Currently receiving systemic antimicrobial treatment for active infection (viral, bacterial, or fungal) at the time of first dose of enfortumab vedotin. Routine antimicrobial prophylaxis is permitted.\n* Known HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with enfortumab vedotin.\n* History of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis; organizing pneumonia, drug-induced pneumonitis, idiopathic pneumonitis, or evidence of active pneumonitis on screening chest CT scan.\n* Prior allogeneic stem cell or solid organ transplant.\n* Other underlying medical condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would impair the ability of the patient to receive or tolerate the planned treatment and follow-up; any known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperating with the requirements of the study.\n* Patients with active tuberculosis.\n* Pregnant or breast feeding\n\nEV/Pembrolizumab exploratory arm only:\n\n* Patients who received prior immunotherapy for metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) or for an alternative malignancy are eligible unless they developed an immune related adverse event while on therapy requiring cessation of therapy or use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive drugs.\n* History of autoimmune diseases. Has an active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in past 2 years (ie, use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive drugs).\n\n  * Patients with vitiligo or residual autoimmune hypothyroidism on stable doses of hormone replacement are permitted to enroll.\n  * Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) on a stable dose of insulin are permitted to enroll.\n  * Replacement therapy (eg, thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency) is not considered a form of systemic treatment and is allowed.\n* On high dose steroids at the time of study enrollment, defined as >20mg prednisone (or bioequivalent), including steroids used for management of intracranial lesions.
