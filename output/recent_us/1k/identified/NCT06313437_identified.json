For strong CYP3A4 inhibitor antifungal azole medications, the starting dose of revumenib has to be adjusted (Table 1).\n* QTc using Fridericia's correction [QTcF]) > 450 msec. Drugs that prolong QTc should be avoided if possible. A list of common QTc prolonging drugs and alternatives that are not QTc prolonging can be found in APPENDIX D.\n* Subject has tested positive for HIV (due to potential drug-drug interaction between antiretroviral medications and Midostaurin/revumenib). Note: HIV testing is not required.\n* Subject is known to be positive for hepatitis B or C infection with the exception of those with an undetectable viral load within 3 months. (Hepatitis B or C testing is not required).
