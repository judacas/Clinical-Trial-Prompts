Weekly single-agent systemic therapy with cisplatin, carboplatin, or cetuximab is allowable.\n* Prior radiotherapy to the region of the study cancer that would result in overlap of radiation therapy fields; prior chemotherapy for study cancer is not allowed.\n* Per the operative and/or pathology report, positive margin(s) [defined as tumor present at the cut or inked edge of the tumor], nodal extracapsular extension, and/or gross residual disease after surgery; Note: Patients whose tumors had focally positive margins in the main specimen but negative margins from re-excised samples in the region of the positive margin are eligible.",
