Patients receiving radiation therapy during the study period are eligible\n* Eligible patient must have bothersome hot flashes for >= 14 days prior to registration, defined by an occurrence of >= 28 times per week and of sufficient severity to cause the patient to seek therapeutic intervention\n* Life expectancy of greater than 6 months\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status - 0, 1, or 2\n* In order to complete the mandatory patient-completed measures, participants must be able to speak and/or read English\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be MALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",

Prior use of these agents is permitted as long as they are discontinued before registration\n* No current or prior use of oxybutynin\n* Patients with a history of any of the following contraindications to oxybutynin are not eligible: gastroparesis or gastrointestinal obstructive disorders; significant gastric reflux symptoms not controlled by medication; ulcerative colitis; narrow-angle glaucoma; urinary retention requiring indwelling or intermittent self-catheterization within the prior 6 months; hypersensitivity to oxybutynin or any other components of the product; current uncontrolled hyperthyroidism; uncontrolled coronary artery disease or a history of myocardial infarction within the prior 12 months; New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II-IV congestive heart failure; symptomatic cardiac arrhythmias; current uncontrolled hypertension; myasthenia gravis; or dementia",
