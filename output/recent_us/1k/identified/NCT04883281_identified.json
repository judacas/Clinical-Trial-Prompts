Squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary is not allowed.\n* Patients must have clinically or radiographically evident measureable disease at the primary site and/or nodal stations. Diagnostic lymph node excision (< 2 nodes) is also allowable.\n* Patients may undergo a diagnostic or therapeutic transoral resection for a T1-2 tonsil or base of tongue cancer.\n* Clinical stage I-IVB (AJCC, 7th edition); stages I-II glottic cancer are excluded\n* Age ≥ 18 years.\n* ECOG Performance Status 0-2\n* Negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 2 weeks before registration for women of childbearing potential.\n* Neck CT and/or neck MRI, and PET-CT (at least skull-to-thigh).\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent.\n* All men, as well as women of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study treatment, and for 90 days following completion of therapy. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.\n\nA female of child-bearing potential is any woman (regardless of sexual orientation, marital status, having undergone a tubal ligation, or remaining celibate by choice) who meets the following criteria:\n\n* Has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or\n* Has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months).\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
