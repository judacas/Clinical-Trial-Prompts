Patients should not have received intervening therapy that did not include anti-PD1/L1 between finishing anti-PD-1/L1 treatment and commencing study treatment.\n\n      Disease progression on an anti-PD-1/L1 therapy is defined as both:\n      1. Having received anti-PD-1/L1 therapy at least twice if dosed every 4 weeks (q4w) or longer, at least 3 times if dosed every 3 weeks (q3w), or at least 4 times if dosed every 2 weeks (q2w) and,\n      2. Having documented clinical or radiographic progression of disease (PD) while on anti-PD-1/L1 therapy.\n   7.

Has measurable disease per RECIST v1.1 or RANO as assessed by the local site investigator/radiologist. Lesions in a previously irradiated area are measurable if progression has been demonstrated after radiation. Lesions must be measurable in at least 2 dimensions in a spiral CT scan or MRI. For lymphoma patients only, the minimum measurement must be >15 mm on the long axis and >10 mm on the short axis.\n\n   a.

Female patients must not be breastfeeding.\n12. Female patients of childbearing potential must be willing to use a highly effective contraception method prior to study entry, while on study drug, and for a period of at least 4 months following the last dose of study drug.\n\n    Note: Women receiving estrogen-based contraceptives will be excluded from the study.\n\n    Note: A woman is considered of childbearing potential unless she is postmenopausal (>1 year without menses and confirmed with a follicle-stimulating hormone test) or surgically sterilized via bilateral oophorectomy, hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or successful Essure® placement with a documented confirmation test at least 3 months after the procedure.\n\n    Male patients must be surgically sterile or willing to use a highly effective double-barrier contraception method (eg, male condom with diaphragm or male condom with cervical cap) upon study entry, while on study drug, and for a period of at least 4 months following the last dose of study drug. Males must agree to refrain from donating sperm during this period.\n13. Highly effective contraception is defined as a method of contraception that has a <1% failure rate when used consistently and correctly (as defined by the International Council for Harmonization Guidance on Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Research M3 [R2]). These methods include implants, injectables, combined hormonal contraceptives (eg, combined oral contraceptives [excluding estrogen-based contraceptives], patch, and vaginal ring), some intrauterine devices (IUDs) (eg, IUD or intrauterine system), sexual abstinence, or a monogamous relationship with a vasectomized partner.\n\n    a. True abstinence, when in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient, is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study drug (ie, 60 days after discontinuing study drug or 5 times the terminal elimination half-life, whichever is longer). Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.\n14.
