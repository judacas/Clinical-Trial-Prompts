Pathologically confirmed, locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC meeting all the following criteria:\n\n   Cohort A participants:\n   * Documented EGFR ex20ins status, as determined by local testing performed at a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certified (United States [US]) or locally certified laboratory (outside the US).\n   * Progressed on or after systemic therapy with an agent targeting ex20ins, either alone or in combination with standard platinum-based chemotherapy for the treatment of advanced disease. Participants who discontinued previous treatment due to unacceptable toxicity are eligible.\n\n     i. Permitted prior ex20ins therapies include: amivantamab, sunvozertinib (DZD9008), and BLU451. Other prior ex20ins--directed treatment may be discussed with the Sponsor for eligibility assessment.\n   * Participants with brain metastasis must be neurologically stable. Participants must have received central nervous system (CNS)-directed therapy and have no evidence of progression for at least 4 weeks after CNS-directed treatment, as ascertained by clinical examination and brain imaging (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] or computed tomography [CT] scan) during the Screening Period. Additionally, they must be on a stable or decreasing dose of corticosteroids and/or anti-convulsant medications for at least 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment. Participants with a history of uncontrolled seizures or LMD are not eligible.\n\n   Cohort B participants:\n   * Documented EGFR ex20instatus, as determined by local testing performed at a CLIA-certified (US) or locally certified laboratory (outside the US).\n   * Participants who have not received prior treatment for advanced or metastatic disease and who are not appropriate candidates for first-line doublet platinum-based chemotherapy based on Investigator judgment or has refused first-line doublet platinum-based chemotherapy following discussion with the Investigator. Prior adjuvant/neoadjuvant treatment for early-stage disease must have been completed >6 months prior to the first dose of study treatment.\n   * Participants with brain metastasis must be neurologically stable. Participants must have received CNS-directed therapy and have no evidence of progression for at least 4 weeks after CNS-directed treatment, as ascertained by clinical examination and brain imaging (MRI or CT scan) during the Screening Period, and they must be on a stable or decreasing dose of corticosteroids and/or anti-convulsant medications for at least 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment. Participants with history of uncontrolled seizures or LMD are not eligible.\n\n   Cohort C participants:\n   * Documented ex20ins or other uncommon single or compound EGFR non-ex20ins status, as determined by local testing performed at a CLIA-certified (US) or locally certified laboratory (outside the US).\n   * Presence of brain metastasis(es) characterized as at least one of the following:\n\n     * Newly diagnosed and/or progressive brain metastasis(es) measurable by Response Assessment in Neuro-oncology Brain Metastases (RANO-BM) criteria and not subjected to CNS-directed therapy, AND/OR\n     * LMD measurable or non-measurable by RANO-BM criteria and confirmed by a positive cerebrospinal fluid cytology, or unequivocal radiographic and/or clinical determination.\n   * Participants may not require other immediate CNS-directed therapy or will likely require other CNS directed anti-tumor therapy during the first cycle of study treatment, as judged by the Investigator.\n\n   Cohort D participants:\n   * Documented other uncommon single or compound EGFR non-ex20ins status (excluding C797S), as determined by local testing performed at a CLIA certified (US) or locally certified laboratory (outside the US). A list of eligible mutations will be provided in a separate document.\n   * Participants with brain metastasis must be neurologically stable. Participants must have received CNS-directed therapy and have no evidence of progression for at least 4 weeks after CNS- directed treatment, as ascertained by clinical examination and brain imaging (MRI or CT scan) during the Screening Period, and they must be on a stable or decreasing dose of corticosteroids and/or anti-convulsant medications for at least 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment. Participants with history of uncontrolled seizures or LMD are not eligible.\n   * Participants who have not received prior systemic therapy for their locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC disease.\n   * Prior adjuvant/neoadjuvant treatment for early-stage disease must have been completed >6 months prior to the first dose of study treatment.
