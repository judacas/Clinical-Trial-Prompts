Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test at screening (within 72 hours of first dose of study medication) and prior to study drug administration. In part 1, WOCBP must agree to use highly effective contraceptive measures starting with the screening visit through 3 months after the last dose of study treatment.

Inhaled or topical steroids, and adrenal replacement steroid doses > 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent, are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease.\n16. Active autoimmune disease or history of autoimmune disease that required systemic treatment within 2 years before starting study treatment (that is, with use of disease-modifying agents or immunosuppressive drugs).\n17. History or current evidence of any condition, co-morbidity, therapy, any active infections, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the participants participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of the participant to participate, in the opinion of the treating Investigator.\n18. A WOCBP who is pregnant or breastfeeding or WOCBP who are not willing to employ effective birth control from screening to 90 days after the last dose of botensilimab (whichever is later).\n19. Previous SARS-CoV-2 infection within 10 days for mild or asymptomatic infections or 20 days for severe/critical illness prior to C1D1.\n20.
