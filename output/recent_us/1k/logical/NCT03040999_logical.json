Participants with oral cavity tumors need to have unresectable disease. Participants with multiple synchronous tumors are not eligible for the study.\n* Has provided tissue for Programmed Cell Death Receptor Ligand 1 (PD-L1) biomarker analysis from a core or excisional biopsy. If an excisional or incisional biopsy has been performed, participants remain eligible for the study provided the residual disease meets the staging criteria required for the trial (e.g., excisional biopsy of a lymph node with residual T4 primary). Prior surgical debulking, including tonsillectomy, for the head and neck cancer under study is not allowed.\n* Has evaluable tumor burden (measurable and/or non-measurable tumor lesions) assessed by computed tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging, based on RECIST version 1.1\n* Is eligible for definitive CRT and not considered for primary surgery based on investigator decision\n* Has Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 performed within 10 days prior to receiving the first dose of study therapy\n* Female participants of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study therapy\n* Female and male participants of reproductive potential must agree to use adequate contraception throughout the study period and for up to 180 days after the last dose of study therapy\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",

Replacement therapy is not considered a form of systemic treatment.\n* Has history of a diagnosed and/or treated hematologic or primary solid tumor malignancy, unless in remission for at least 5 years prior to randomization\n* Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis\n* Has had previous allogeneic tissue/solid organ transplant\n* Has active infection requiring systemic therapy\n* Has a history of severe hypersensitivity reaction to pembrolizumab, Cisplatin or radiotherapy or their analogs\n* Is pregnant or breast feeding or expecting to conceive or father children throughout the study period and for up to 180 days after the last dose of study therapy",
