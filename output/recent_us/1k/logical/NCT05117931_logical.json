(Note: if a patient previously received a EGFR inhibitor, but subsequently demonstrated a MET amplification, or previously received a MET inhibitor, but subsequently demonstrated an EGFR-amplification, inclusion is permitted).\n* Patients with HER2+ (IHC 3+ or IHC 2+/FISH+) tumors must have progressed on trastuzumab.\n* Measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1.\n* ≥ 18 years of age on day of signing informed consent.\n* Have an ECOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2.\n* Adequate organ function, defined as:\n\nA. Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL\n\nB. ANC ≥1.0 x 10^9 /L\n\nC. Platelets ≥75 x 10^9 /L\n\nD. AST and ALT ≤3 x ULN (≤5 x ULN for subjects with liver metastases)\n\nE. Total bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN; subjects with Gilbert's syndrome can enroll if conjugated bilirubin is within normal limits\n\nF. Serum creatinine <1.5 x ULN or if available, calculated or measured creatinine clearance >50 mL/min/1.73 m^2\n\n* Women of childbearing potential and male patients with women of childbearing potential partners must be willing to use an adequate method of contraception\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",

Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or in situ cervical cancer that has undergone potentially curative therapy.\n* Known active hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive or polymerase chain reaction detectable).\n\nNote: Subjects with a prior history of HBV demonstrated by positive hepatitis B core antibody are eligible if they have at Screening 1) a negative HBsAg and 2) a HBV DNA (viral load) below the lower limit of quantification, per local testing. Subjects with a positive HBsAg due to recent vaccination are eligible if HBV DNA (viral load) is below the lower limit of quantification, per local testing.\n\n* Known active hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA [qualitative] is detected).\n\nNote: Subjects with a prior history of HCV, who have completed antiviral treatment and have subsequently documented HCV RNA below the lower limit of quantification per local testing are eligible.\n\n* Other clinically active or chronic liver disease.\n* Subject has uncontrolled inter-current illness, including but not limited to poorly controlled diabetes, ongoing or active infection (i.e., has discontinued all antibiotics for at least one week prior to first dose of study drug), or psychiatric illness/social situation that would limit compliance with study requirements. Subjects with medical conditions requiring chronic continuous oxygen therapy are excluded.\n* Pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT), within 1 month of start of study drug.\n* Myocardial infarction, unstable angina, stroke, transient ischemic attach (TIA), or coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft, or any acute coronary syndrome within 6 months of start of study drug.\n* Congestive heart failure defined as New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III-IV or hospitalization for congestive heart failure (any NYHA class) within 6 months of start of study drug.\n* Interstitial lung disease (ILD), including drug-induced ILD or radiation pneumonitis requiring treatment with prolonged steroids or other immune suppressive agents that is unresolved or resolved within the last 3 months.\n* Immune-mediated rash from checkpoint inhibitors that has not resolved prior to enrollment.\n* Known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial, in the opinion of the treating investigator.\n* Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit through 6 months after the last dose of trial treatment.\n* Prisoners, or subjects who are compulsory detained.",
