Subjects trated with a 1st or 2nd generation TKI in 1st line who developed a documented T790M mutation must have received a TKI targeting this mutation such as Osimertinib or Lazertinib to be eligible. Subjects must have documentation of EGFR mutated NSCLC as assessed by an approved test using genomic sequencing of tumor or circulation free tumor DNA. The patients should have received a 2nd line of treatment if approved and available or may be enrolled in the study if in the opinion of the investigator it is in the patient's best interest,or the SOC is not appropriate.\n* Adequate organ function\n* Phase 1: Evaluable or measurable disease per RECIST v1.1\n* Phase 2a: Measurable disease per RECIST v1.1\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
