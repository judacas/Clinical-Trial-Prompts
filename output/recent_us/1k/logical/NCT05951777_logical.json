Known history of: a) intellectual deficiency or psychiatric conditions likely to invalidate our ability to assess changes in cognition or behavior; b) recently treated infection; c) renal disease or altered renal function (screening eGFR (estimated glomerular filtration rate) < 60 mL/min/1.73m2); d) hepatic disease or altered liver function (screening SGPT (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase) > 150 U/L or T. Bilirubin >1.3 mg/dL); e) cancer; f) immunosuppression (screening WBC (white blood cell) < 3, 000 cells/ml); g) Positive infectious disease tests including HIV, Hep. B, Hep. C., and Syphilis; h) chemical or ETOH (Ethanol/Alcohol) dependency that in the opinion of the investigator would preclude participation in the study; i) acute or chronic lung disease requiring significant medication, oxygen supplementation, or mechanical ventilation; j) bleeding disorders including immune-mediated heparin-induced thrombocytopenia; k) known sensitivity to heparin, Lovenox, and pork products; l) individuals with mechanical prosthetic heart valves; m) individuals who have received a stem cell treatment.\n2. Normal brain CT/MRI (computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging) exam.\n3. Spinal deformity, spinal surgery (including repeated epidural or spinal punctures), or complete spinal cord injury diagnosed by CT (computed tomography) or MR (magnetic resonance) imaging or by clinical findings.\n4. Diagnosed with a genetic or metabolic disorder related to the neurologic condition.\n5. Other acute or chronic medical conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator, may increase the risks associated with study participation.\n6. For women of child bearing potential, a positive pregnancy test at the screening visit or, for both women and men, unwillingness to comply with acceptable methods of birth control during the study.\n7. Concurrent participation in interventional drug or device study.\n8. Inability to undergo the diagnostic tests (PET/DT-MRI (positron emission tomography/diffusion tensor-magnetic resonance imaging)) or unwilling/unable to cooperate with the diagnostic tests and outcome assessments.\n9. Metal implants including baclofen pumps that would preclude DT-MRI (Diffusion tensor-magnetic resonance imaging).\n10. Unwilling or unable to return for the follow-up study visits.",
