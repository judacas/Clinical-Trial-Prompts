For participants with malignant mesothelioma, prior treatment of ≥2 regimens are required, including but not limit to immune checkpoint therapy.\n4. Presence of at least one evaluable lesion in Part 1 or one measurable target lesion in Part 2 according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) for participants with non-pleural mesothelioma or other solid tumors and modified RECIST (mRECIST) v1.1 for participants with malignant pleural mesothelioma.\n5.
