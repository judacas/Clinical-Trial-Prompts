        "exclusion_criteria": "* Participant has distant metastatic disease.\n* Participant has received prior radiation therapy, systemic therapy, or surgery for management of rectal cancer.\n* Participant has any history of interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis\n* Participant has experienced any of the following with prior immunotherapy: any irAE of Grade ≥3, immune-related severe neurologic events of any grade (e.g., myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis, encephalitis, Guillain Barré Syndrome, or transverse myelitis), exfoliative dermatitis of any grade (Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, or DRESS syndrome), or myocarditis of any grade. Non clinically significant laboratory abnormalities are not exclusionary.\n* Participant has a known additional malignancy that progressed or required active treatment within the past 2 years. Exceptions include adequately treated superficial skin cancers, superficial bladder cancers, and other in situ cancers.\n* Participant has an active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e., with use of disease-modifying agents, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency) is not considered a form of systemic treatment.\n* Participant has a history of severe allergic and/or anaphylactic reactions to chimeric, human or humanized antibodies, fusion proteins, or has known allergies to dostarlimab or its excipients.\n* Has received or plans to receive an organ or stem cell transplant that uses donor stem cells (allogeneic stem cell transplant).",
