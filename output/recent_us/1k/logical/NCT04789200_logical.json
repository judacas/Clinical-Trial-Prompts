Subject is between the ages of 18 to 85 years old, inclusive\n3. Has had CT of the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast within 6 months\n4. Has a concern for disease involvement of the bowel or structure adjacent to bowel (e.g. peritoneal disease, carcinomatosis, omental cake, bowel inflammation, lymphadenopathy, or fluid collection).\n5. Is willing and able to comply with protocol-specified CT scanning and visits to the clinic\n6. Is able to lie flat with arms above head for 15 minutes and hold breath for 15 seconds\n7. Is able to drink 1.2 liters of fluid within 45 minutes\n8. Has good venous access as determined by the Investigator at screening\n9. Is an outpatient who is able and willing to come to the clinic for study visits\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 85 Years",
        "exclusion_criteria": "1. Has any co-morbidity that the Investigator judges will interfere with their ability to complete the study or undergo a quality CT scan, e.g. high risk of aspiration\n2. Has a history of or is currently suffering from a known gastrointestinal motility disorder, e.g. severe constipation / gastroparesis, achalasia, pseudo-obstruction, etc.\n3. Has symptoms of a possible current bowel obstruction\n4. Has a moderate to high risk of current bowel perforation\n5. Subject should not schedule a GI diagnostic surgery or hospitalization for any procedure until after the study follow-up on Day 14 day. However, if at the time of study entry, the subject has pre-planned a surgery or hospitalization, it may be allowed at the discretion of the PI provided it does not take place until after the subject completes the Day 3 visit.\n6. Has a contraindication (i.e. allergy) to IV or Oral CT contrast\n7. If of child-bearing potential, has a confirmed pregnancy or a high probability of pregnancy at the time of screening\n8.
