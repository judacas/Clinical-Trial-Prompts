Morbidly obese (BMI â‰¥ 35).\n9. Uncontrolled diabetes.\n10. Compromised immune system due to disease state, chronic corticosteroid use, or other immunosuppressive therapy.\n11. Medical condition or disorder that may limit life expectancy or that may cause clinical investigation plan (CIP) deviations (e.g., unable to perform self-evaluations or accurately report medical history, symptoms, or data).\n12. History of bleeding diathesis or uncorrectable coagulopathy.\n13. Known allergy or hypersensitivity to bovine proteins or allergens, gentamicin sulfate, or ampicillin that medically warrants exclusion as determined by the physician.\n14.

Evidence or known high risk of recurrent or persistent cancer as determined by the physician during screening.\n2. Tests positive for Hepatitis B (required tests: Hepatitis B Surface Antigen [HBsAg] and Anti-Hepatitis B Core Antibody [Anti-HBc]), Hepatitis C (required test: Hepatitis C Antibody [Anti-HCV]), HIV (required tests: HIV Type 1 and 2 Antibodies [Anti-HIV-1, 2]), and/or Syphilis.\n\n   a. Tests performed by certified/authorized testing laboratory using licensed/approved tests and performed on blood samples collected within 30 days prior to muscle tissue procurement.\n3. Cannot, or is not willing to, maintain the current treatment regimen for existing conservative therapy (e.g., swallowing therapy).\n4. Requires prophylactic antibiotics for chronic infections, or has required 2 or more courses of antibiotics for infections in the 2 months prior to signing consent.\n5. Any condition, including current infection, which could lead to significant postoperative complications.\n6. Refuses to provide written informed consent.\n7.
