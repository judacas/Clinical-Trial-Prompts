For Cohort 1: MET exon 14 skipping suspected by local or central biomarker assessment. [local testing is accepted for eligibility; all patients will have confirmation by central laboratory, but this result is not necessary for eligibility; local molecular pathology result will suffice]. This testing can be from archival or fresh tissue sample and/or blood specimen; any sample, any test positive subjects are eligible.\n5. Treatment experience\n\n   a. Cohort 1: Anti-tumor treatment naïve subject upon refusal to receive 1st line standard of care, or not tolerated to 1st line standard of care, or progressed after standard of care with no greater than 2 prior treatment regimens (neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and maintenance therapies do not qualify as separate treatment regimens).\n6.

Sexual intercourse with vasectomized male/sterilized female partner,\n   3. Hormonal female contraceptive (oral, parenteral, intravaginal, implantable, or transdermal) for at least 3 consecutive months prior to investigational product administration (when not clinically contraindicated as in breast, ovarian and endometrial cancers),\n   4. Use of an intrauterine contraceptive device. Note: Abstinence, the rhythm method, and/or contraception by the partner are not acceptable methods of birth control\n8. Resolution of prior-therapy-related AEs (including immune-related AEs but excluding alopecia) to ≤ Grade 1 per CTCAE v 5.0, and no treatment for these AEs for at least 2 weeks prior to the time of enrollment. Alopecia, sensory neuropathy Grade ≤ 2, or other Grade ≤ 2 AEs not constituting a safety risk based on investigator's judgment are acceptable.\n9. Adequate organ function as indicated by laboratory values.\n10. Tissue and blood specimens\n\n    1. Willing to undergo a new biopsy or have available archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue specimen. The archival tissue must be:\n\n       * collected after progression from most recent prior systemic anti-cancer treatment, OR\n       * tissue samples collected prior to previous lines of treatment,\n    2. ALL subjects must undergo blood sample for biomarker assessment.\n11. Able and willing to comply with the protocol and the restrictions and assessments therein.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",

Prior organ or stem cell transplant.\n8. Known active infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human T-cell leukemia virus, type (HTLV-1), hepatitis B virus (HBV), or hepatitis C virus (HCV), unless the patients fall into below categories (patients fall into one of the a, b, c category are eligible to participate)\n\n   a. HIV\n   * CD4+ cells ≥ 350 cells/µL\n   * No history of AIDS\n   * No history of opportunistic infection in the past 12 months b.

Exceptions to this exclusion include the following: completely resected basal cell and squamous cell skin cancers, indolent malignancies that currently do not require treatment, and completely resected carcinoma in situ of any type.\n12. Active infection requiring therapy.

History or clinical evidence of any surgical or medical condition which the investigator judges as likely to interfere with the results of the study or pose an additional risk in participating e.g., rapidly progressive or uncontrolled disease involving a major organ system-vascular, cardiac, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, gynecologic, hematologic, neurologic, neoplastic, renal, endocrine, autoimmune or an immunodeficiency, or clinically significant active psychiatric or abuse disorders.\n19. Is a regular user (including \"recreational use\") of any illicit drugs or had a recent history (within the last year) of substance abuse (including alcohol).\n20.
