The dose/schedule of cycles administered will be as per standard of care. It is acceptable for up to 1 cycle of the protocol-specified regimens to be missing one of the listed agents (example, held due to toxicity).

A minimum of one lesion with a bi-dimensional measurement of at least 1 centimeter (cm)*1 cm is required\n* Cohorts B, C: For participants with neither serum nor urine measurable disease, baseline positron emission tomography/ computed tomography (PET/CT) or whole body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be used to satisfy the measurable disease criteria\n* Cohorts A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status grade of 0 or 1\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",

The only allowed exceptions are: a) non-muscle invasive bladder cancer treated within the last 24 months that is considered completely cured; b) skin cancer (non-melanoma or melanoma) treated within the last 24 months that is considered completely cured; c) non-invasive cervical cancer treated within the last 24 months that is considered completely cured; d) localized prostate cancer (N0M0): with a Gleason score of greater than or equal to (=>)6, treated within the last 24 months or untreated and under surveillance, with a Gleason score of 3+4 that has been treated more than 6 months prior to full study screening and considered to have a very low risk of recurrence, or history of localized prostate cancer and receiving androgen deprivation therapy and considered to have a very low risk of recurrence, e) breast cancer: adequately treated lobular carcinoma in situ or ductal carcinoma in situ, or history of localized breast cancer and receiving antihormonal agents and considered to have a very low risk of recurrence; f) malignancy that is considered cured with minimal risk of recurrence\n* Cohorts E, G, and H: Frailty index of >= 2 according to Myeloma Geriatric Assessment score",
