Patients participating in one of the two LGBTQ groups (i.e., LGBTQ individuals who identify as male; LGBTQ individuals who identify as female) must self-identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, or queer.\n* Providers: We will recruit a total of 8 providers from the Duke Cancer Institute, including 2 from each type of cancer that we are targeting (breast, gynecologic, colorectal, and prostate). Within each cancer site, we will recruit one physician and one physician-extender (physician assistant, nurse practitioner, or nurse) to represent the range of provider types. Eligible providers will be currently treating patients in one of the above listed disease groups at the Duke Cancer Institute.\n* Patients recruited for CASCADE: Patients treated at the Duke Cancer Institute will be recruited to complete the anonymous survey. All participants will meet the following inclusion criteria: a) aged 18 years or older; b) able to speak and understand English; and c) diagnosis of breast, prostate, gynecologic, or gastrointestinal cancer and treated at the Duke Cancer Institute.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
