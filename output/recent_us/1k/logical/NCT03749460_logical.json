(in addition to the lesion/s that will be treated with stereotactic radiation therapy)\n* Have provided tissue from an archival tissue sample or newly obtained core or excisional biopsy of a tumor lesion.

This will not apply to subjects with confirmed Gilbert's syndrome (persistent or recurrent hyperbilirubinemia that is predominantly unconjugated in the absence of hemolysis or hepatic pathology), who will be allowed only in consultation with their physician (performed within 28 days of treatment initiation)\n* Aspartate aminotransferases (AST) (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT]) =< 2.5 x institutional upper limit of normal unless liver metastases are present, in which case it must be =< 5 x ULN (performed within 28 days of treatment initiation)\n* Serum creatinine clearance (CL) > 40 mL/min by the Cockcroft-Gault formula (Cockcroft and Gault 1976) or by 24-hour urine collection for determination of creatinine clearance (performed within 28 days of treatment initiation)\n* Evidence of post-menopausal status OR negative urinary or serum pregnancy test for female pre-menopausal patients. Women will be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrheic for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. The following age-specific requirements apply:\n\n  * Women < 50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal treatments and if they have luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone levels in the post-menopausal range for the institution or underwent surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy, or hysterectomy)\n  * Women >= 50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments, had radiation-induced menopause with last menses > 1 year ago, had chemotherapy-induced menopause with last menses > 1 year ago, or underwent surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or hysterectomy)\n* Female subjects of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required\n* Female subjects of childbearing potential should be willing to use 1 method of highly effective birth control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course of the study through 180 days after the last dose of study medication. Subjects of childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not been free from menses for > 1 year\n* Male subjects should agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting with the first dose of study therapy through 180 days after the last dose of study therapy\n* Patient is >= 5 years free of another primary malignancy, except:\n\n  * If the other malignancy is basal cell carcinoma or cervical carcinoma in situ or\n  * If the other primary malignancy is not considered clinically significant and is requiring no active intervention\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
