Patients may not have any impairment of gastrointestinal function or gastrointestinal disease that may significantly alter the absorption of the study drug.\n* Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine beta human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) pregnancy test result within 14 days prior to the first dose of imipramine.\n* Patients must be eligible for surgical resection of their breast cancer or repeat biopsy after completing treatment.\n* Patients must have a complete history and physical examination within 30 days prior to registration.\n* Patients must have a performance status of ECOG 0, 1, 2.\n* Tissue block of initial biopsy specimen is available.\n* Patient may not be concurrently enrolled in another investigational drug treatment study.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 71 Years",
        "exclusion_criteria": "* Known diagnosis of major depressive disorder, bipolar depression or psychosis\n* ECOG 3 or 4\n* Age >= 70 years\n* Renal impairment defined as EGFR <30\n* Hepatic impairment as judged by clinical investigator or bilirubin >2\n* As judged by the investigator, severe uncontrolled concurrent medical conditions, psychiatric illness or social condition that would limit compliance with study requirements\n* History of cardiac disease (arrhythmia, conduction abnormality, congenital prolonged QT syndrome, or prolonged QTc rhythm noted during initial EKG >480 ms)\n* Current use of SSRI, SNRI, MAO inhibitor, tramadol or trazadone; or use of these agents within 14 days\n* Inflammatory breast cancer\n* Suicidal ideation or history of suicide attempt\n* Myocardial infarction within 3 months of study initiation.\n* Patients with Angle-Closure Glaucoma\n* Pregnant or breast-feeding women. As there have been no well-controlled studies conducted with pregnant women to determine the effect of imipramine on the fetus. However, there have been clinical reports of congenital malformations associated with the use of the drug.",
