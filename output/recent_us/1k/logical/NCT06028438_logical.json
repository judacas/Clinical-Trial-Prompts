IR to at least 1bDMARD (or the biosimilars) other than anti-TNF agents, as assessed by the treating physician, after at least 12 weeks of therapy including but not limited to abatacept, anakinra, tocilizumab, and sarilumab or at least 16 weeks of therapy with rituximab Documented IR may include inadequate improvement or loss in response after initial improvement in joint counts or other parameters of disease activity\n  2. Intolerance to bDMARD (or biosimilars) other than anti-TNF agent, as assessed by the treating physician. Documented intolerance includes side effects and injection or infusion reactions\n* If has received prior anti-TNF agent (including biosimilars), has demonstrated IR to >=1 anti-TNF agent (including biosimilars), as assessed by the treating physician:\n\n  1.
