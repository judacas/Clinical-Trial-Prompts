Though these patients might be receiving assistance in taking medication from a caregiver, it is likely that their medication taking routine would be significantly different from the general population of patients with NF1.\n* Patients receiving the study drug in liquid form, since the use of medication event monitoring systems (MEMS^TM) caps prohibits liquid dosing.\n\nExclusion Criteria for Parent or Caregiver\n\nNone\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 3 Years\nMust have maximum age of 59 Years",
