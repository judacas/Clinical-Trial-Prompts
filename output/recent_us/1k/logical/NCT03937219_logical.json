Measurable disease must be outside the radiation field if radiation therapy was previously administered.\n* Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) â‰¥ 70%.\n* Adequate organ and marrow function.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
        "exclusion_criteria": "* Prior systemic anticancer therapy for unresectable locally advanced or metastatic RCC including investigational agents.\n* Radiation therapy for bone metastasis within 2 weeks, any other radiation therapy within 4 weeks prior to randomization.\n* Known brain metastases or cranial epidural disease unless adequately treated with radiotherapy and stable for at least 4 weeks prior to randomization.\n* Concomitant anticoagulation with oral anticoagulants or platelet inhibitors.\n* Administration of a live, attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to randomization.\n* Uncontrolled, significant intercurrent or recent illness including, but not limited to serious cardiovascular disorders (including uncontrolled hypertension defined as sustained blood pressure (BP) > 150 mm Hg systolic or > 90 mm Hg diastolic despite optimal antihypertensive treatment), GI disorders associated with high risk for perforation or fistula formation, tumors invading GI tract, bowel obstruction, intra-abdominal abscess, clinically significant bleeding events, cavitating pulmonary lesions, or lesions invading major pulmonary blood vessels.\n* Other clinically significant disorders such as:\n\n  * Autoimmune disease that has been symptomatic or required treatment within the past two years from the date of randomization.\n  * Any condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (> 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of randomization.\n  * Active infection requiring systemic treatment. Acute or chronic hepatitis B or C infection, known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related illness, or known positive test for tuberculosis infection where there is clinical or radiographic evidence of active myobacterial infection.\n  * Known history of COVID-19 unless the subject has clinically recovered from the disease at least 30 days prior to randomization.\n* Major surgery (eg, nephrectomy, GI surgery, removal or biopsy of brain metastasis) within 4 weeks prior to randomization. Minor surgeries within 10 days prior to randomization. Subjects must have complete wound healing from major or minor surgery before randomization.\n* Any other active malignancy at time of randomization or diagnosis of another malignancy within 3 years prior to randomization that requires active treatment, except for locally curable cancers that have been apparently cured, such as basal or squamous cell skin cancer, superficial bladder cancer, or carcinoma in situ of the prostate, cervix, or breast.",
