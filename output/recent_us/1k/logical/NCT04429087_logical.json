Standard therapies should include at least one line of chemotherapy that should include platinum for patients with small cells carcinoma tumors histologies.\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1.\n* At least one evaluable lesion outside of CNS as defined per modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1\n* Subjects with brain metastases are eligible provided they meet the following criteria:\n\n  * Radiotherapy or surgery for brain metastases was completed at least 2 weeks prior to the first administration of BI 764532\n  * Patient is off steroids for at least 7 days (physiologic doses of steroids are permitted), and the patient is off anti-epileptic drugs for at least 7 days or on stable doses of anti-epileptic drugs for malignant Central Nervous System (CNS) disease.\n* Adequate liver, bone marrow and renal organ function Further inclusion criteria apply.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",

Physiological replacement of steroids is allowed.\n* Prior anti-cancer therapy:\n\n  * Patients who have been treated with any other anti-cancer drug within 3 weeks or within 5 half-life periods (whichever is shorter) prior to first administration of BI 764532.\n  * Patients who have been treated with extensive field radiotherapy including whole brain irradiation within 2 weeks prior to first administration of BI 764532.\n* Other active malignancy that could interfere with the prognosis and treatment of the disease of the study.\n* Major surgery within 28 days of first dose BI 764532.\n* Women who are pregnant (including those who are considered to be possibly pregnant based on the investigator's clinical judgement), nursing/breast feeding or who plan to become pregnant or nurse while in the trial or within 35 days after the last dose of study treatment.\n* Active infection that requires medical therapy or other clinically significant intervention or within 2 weeks prior to study entry confirmed (PCR test or other applicable test as per local requirements) or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection or close contact with an individual with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nFurther exclusion criteria apply.",
