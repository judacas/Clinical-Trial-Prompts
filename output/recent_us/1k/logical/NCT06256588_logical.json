Non-clinically significant laboratory abnormalities are not exclusionary.\n* Has undergone any major surgical procedure or experienced significant traumatic injury within 28 days prior to enrolment.\n* Has any history of interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis (past or current).\n* Has cirrhosis or current unstable liver biliary disease per investigator assessment defined by the presence of ascites, encephalopathy, coagulopathy, hypoalbuminemia, esophageal/gastric varices, or persistent jaundice.\n* Has a history or current evidence of any medical condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the study results, interfere with their participation for the full duration of the study intervention, or indicate it is not in the best interest of the participant to participate, in the opinion of the investigator.\n* Is receiving any other anticancer or experimental therapy. No other experimental therapies (including but not limited to chemotherapy, radiation, hormonal treatment, antibody therapy, immunotherapy, gene therapy, vaccine therapy, or other experimental drugs) of any kind are permitted while the participant is receiving study intervention.\n* Previous treatment with anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent or an agent directed to another stimulatory or coinhibitory T-cell receptor [e.g., Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 (CTLA4), OX-40, CD137]\n* Is pregnant, breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive children within the projected duration of the study, starting with the Screening Visit through 120 days after the last dose of study intervention.\n* Has a history of severe allergic and/or anaphylactic reactions to chimeric, human or humanized antibodies, fusion proteins, or known allergies to dostarlimab or its excipients.",
