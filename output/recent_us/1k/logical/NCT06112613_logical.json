If the medication is supplied as capsules in a pill bottle (e.g., Ibrance capsules), patient is not eligible\n  * NOTE: Ribociclib (Kisqali) and abemaciclib (Verzenio) are only available in blister packs. Palbociclib (Ibrance) is the only CDK4/6 inhibitor that might be available in a capsule formulation. However, this is an outdated formulation and is rarely prescribed as a new start. The format of ordered palbociclib can be determined based on the prescription order\n* PATIENT STEP 0: Patients must not have been previously treated with any of the following CDK4/6 inhibitors: Palbociclib or Ibrance, ribociclib or Kisqali, and abemaciclib or Verzenio\n* PATIENT STEP 0: Patients must not already be enrolled in a therapeutic clinical trial that monitors CDK4/6 inhibitors\n* PATIENT STEP 0: Patient must confirm that they intend to receive their care or monitoring at an NCORP site\n* PATIENT STEP 0: Patient must have a personal mobile phone in which they are able and willing to send and receive text messages\n\n  * NOTE: The restriction to those with mobile phone access with text messaging is based on the primary intention of the study which involves the use of text messaging to improve adherence\n* PATIENT STEP 0: Patient must have an email address\n\n  * NOTE: The restriction to those with an email address is based on the primary intention of the study which involves patients responding to questions regarding their reasons for non-adherence after every missed dose to improve adherence\n* PATIENT STEP 0: Patient must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document\n\n  * NOTE: Patients with impaired decision-making capacity (IDMC) who have a legally authorized representative (LAR) or caregiver and/or family member available are not eligible\n* PATIENT STEP 0: Patient must not have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status >= 3 OR patient must not be deemed medically unable to participate in the study by the study investigators or an oncology clinician (i.e., referral to hospice)\n* PATIENT STEP 0: Patient must not be enrolled in other trials offering financial assistance\n\n  * NOTE: Gift cards for survey completion, parking passes, or free medication provided as part of therapeutic trials are not considered financial assistance\n* PATIENT STEP 1: Patient must meet all the eligibility criteria for Step 0\n* PATIENT STEP 1: Patient must have signed a written informed consent form\n* PATIENT STEP 1: Patient must have completed baseline survey within 30 days of the date of Step 0 Registration\n* PATIENT STEP 1: Patients must have initiated their CDK 4/6 inhibitors within 30 days of the date of Step 0 registration\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
