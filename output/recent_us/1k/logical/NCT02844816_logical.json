Trial registration must occur within 9 months of the last dose of BCG\n\n    * If a patient does not meet these criteria only because the last dose of BCG was more than 9 months ago, the patient may become eligible if he/she shows histologically proven high grade recurrence after an additional round of induction or maintenance BCG (>= 3 doses) within 9 months prior to registration\n  * Patient achieves disease-free state at 6 month time point (i.e., complete response; presence of only low-grade tumor at this timepoint is still considered complete response) after induction and maintenance (or second round of induction) BCG but later experiences a high-grade Ta/T1 recurrence (with or without concomitant CIS) within 6 months after the last dose of BCG or recurrent CIS (in absence of concomitant Ta/T1 tumor) within 12 months after the last BCG dose; the time of eligibility is measured from the last dose of BCG to the time of disease recurrence; the patient must be registered on the trial within 60 days of this recurrence, or within 60 days of a re-TURBT if indicated\n* All adverse events associated with any prior surgery and intravesical therapy must have resolved to grade =< 2 prior to registration\n* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >= 1,500 microliter (mcL) (within 42 days prior to registration)\n* Platelets >= 100,000/mcL (within 42 days prior to registration)\n* Hemoglobin >= 9 g/dL (within 42 days prior to registration)\n* Total bilirubin =< 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (IULN) (except Gilbert's syndrome, who must have a total bilirubin < 3.0 mg/dL) (within 42 days prior to registration)\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) =< 2 x IULN (within 42 days prior to registration)\n* Serum creatinine =< 1.5 ULN OR measured or calculated creatinine clearance >= 30 mL/min (within 42 days prior to registration)\n* Patients must have Zubrod performance status =< 2\n* Patients must have a baseline electrocardiograph (ECG) performed within 42 days prior to registration\n* Patients positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are eligible only if they have all of the following:\n\n  * A stable regimen of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART)\n  * No requirement for concurrent antibiotics or antifungal agents for the prevention of opportunistic infections\n  * A CD4 count above 250 cells/mcL and an undetectable HIV viral load on standard PCR-based tests\n* No other prior malignancy is allowed except, for the following: adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, adequately treated stage I or II cancer from which the patient is currently in complete remission, or any other cancer from which the patient has been disease free for five years\n* Patients must be offered the opportunity to participate in specimen banking for future studies, to include translational medicine studies\n* Patients must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and must sign and give written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines\n* As a part of the oncology patient enrollment network (OPEN) registration process the treating institution's identity is provided in order to ensure that the current (within 365 days) date of institutional review board approval for this study has been entered in the system\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
