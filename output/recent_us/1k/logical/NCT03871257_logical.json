Any multivitamin containing vitamin E must be stopped prior to study enrollment even if less than 100% of the daily recommended dosing for vitamin E\n  * Surgery within 2 weeks prior to enrollment, with the exception of surgical placement for vascular access or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diverting procedures such as endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) and ventriculo-peritoneal (VP) shunt.\n\n    * Note: Patients must have healed from any prior surgery prior to enrollment\n* Patients who have an uncontrolled infection are not eligible",
