Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least 3 months prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using steroids for at least 7 days prior to trial treatment.\n* Is currently participating and receiving study therapy or has participated in a study of an investigational agent and received study therapy or used an investigational device within 4 weeks of the first dose of treatment.\n* Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment. Prior history of autoimmune thyroiditis or vitiligo is permitted.\n* Has a known history of active TB (Bacillus Tuberculosis)\n* Hypersensitivity to pembrolizumab or any of its excipients.\n* Has had a prior anti-cancer monoclonal antibody (mAb) within 4 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.\n* Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment. Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical cancer.\n* Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years.\n* Has history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or active, non-infectious pneumonitis.\n* Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy or systemic use of antimicrobials within 72 hours prior to the first study treatment\n* Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.\n* Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial.\n* Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.\n* Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent.\n* Hypersensitivity to pembrolizumab or any of its excipients.\n* Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).\n* Has known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA is detected).\n* Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy.",
