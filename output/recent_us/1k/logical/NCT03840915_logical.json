Participants who had disease progression on previous treatment with Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD- L1) inhibitors in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy are enrolled in Cohort D, as long as therapy was completed at least 28 days of the first study intervention.\n* Have measurable disease based on Response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) 1.1\n* Have a life expectancy of at least 3 months\n* Availability of archived tumor material (less than [<] 6 months old) adequate for biomarker analysis is mandatory at Screening, central laboratory confirmation is required.

Participants with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are clinically stable for at least 2 weeks after the end of the RT and, have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases evaluated by imaging, preferably brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\n* Known severe hypersensitivity to study intervention or any components in their formulations\n* For participants in Cohort A, B and C: Has received prior systemic therapy for Stage IV NSCLC, including anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CD137, or anti-Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) antibody (including ipilimumab or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation or checkpoint pathways)\n* Unable to tolerate computed tomography (CT) or MRI in the opinion of the Investigator and/or allergy to contrast material.",
