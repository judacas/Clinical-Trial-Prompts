Females of childbearing potential who are sexually active with a nonsterilized male partner must use effective contraception from time of screening, and must agree to continue using such precautions for 90 days after the final dose of TAB004 or toripalimab; cessation of birth control after this point should be discussed with a responsible physician.

FSH testing will be conducted at the Screening visit to confirm post-menopausal status).\n* 10. Subjects must use effective contraception. Nonsterilized males who are sexually active with a female partner of childbearing potential must use effective contraception from Day 1 and for 90 days after receipt of the final dose of TAB004 or toripalimab.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",

A history of childhood asthma or the presence of mild adult asthma that at baseline has symptoms that can be controlled well with inhaled corticosteroids or short acting beta agonists will not be excluded.\n* 20. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure according to New York Heart Association Functional Classification ≥ 3, uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, active peptic ulcer disease or gastritis, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements, substantially increase risk of incurring adverse events from TAB004, or compromise the ability of the subject to give written informed consent.\n* 21.
