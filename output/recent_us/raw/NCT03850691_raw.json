    "official_title": "IMPACT OF 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT ON INITIAL AND SUBSEQUENT TREATMENT STRATEGIES OF PATIENTS WITH PROSTATE CANCER (PROSPYL)",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Participants who fulfill criteria for initial staging or restaging as outlined below:\n\n  1. Initial treatment strategy decisions (initial staging)\n\n     All participants with histologically proven prostate cancer or strong suspicion of prostate adenocarcinoma based on very high PSA levels (>50 ng/mL) who require an initial treatment/management decision who may be candidate for any of the following strategies:\n\n     A) Surgery B) External radiation therapy (RT) C) Other focal therapies D) Systemic medical treatment E) Watchful waiting\n  2. Assessment for Subsequent treatment strategy (restaging), any of the following:\n\nA) Participants with biochemical recurrence who are potential candidates for any salvage treatment. Biochemical recurrence is defined by rising PSA after definitive therapy with prostatectomy or radiation therapy, as any of the following:\n\n1. Post radical prostatectomy (RP): PSA equals to or greater than 0.2 ng/mL measured more than 6 weeks after RP\n2. Post-radiation therapy : Nadir + greater than or equal to 2 ng/mL rise in PSA B) Participants with known prostate cancer who undergo restaging because of new symptoms C) Participants with known metastatic prostate cancer who undergo restaging because of rising PSA with negative or inconclusive conventional imaging D) Participants with known prostate cancer who are treated medically or with RLT in whom response to treatment is assessed\n\n   * Capability to provide written informed consent\n   * Able to remain still for duration of each imaging procedure (about 30 minutes) * Participants may be reenrolled in the study, if 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT is performed for subsequent management decision.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be MALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Less than 18 years-old at the time of radiotracer administration\n* Inability to complete the needed investigational and standard-of-care imaging examinations due to other reasons (severe claustrophobia, radiation phobia, etc.)\n* Any additional medical condition, serious concurrent illness, or other extenuating circumstance that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may significantly interfere with study compliance.\n* Inability to provide written informed consent",
