If archived tumour tissue is available from the last treatment failure, sections may be supplied instead of a pre-treatment biopsy.\n\nModule C:\n\n* Histologically confirmed diagnosis of one of the following cohorts:\n\n  * Cohort 1: GEC: Locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma or GEC.\n  * Cohort 2: Patients with secondary resistance to anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 based therapy: Any advanced or metastatic solid tumour (excluding NSCLC and melanoma) with previously anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 based treatment which progressed after achieving benefit.\n  * Cohort 3: Patients with primary resistance to anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 based therapy: Select advanced or metastatic solid tumour types with previous anti-PD-1/PD-L1 based treated tumour without achieving benefit.\n  * Cohort 4: Locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic second line or greater, microsatellite stable (MSS) colorectal cancer.\n  * Cohort 5: Advanced Endometrial cancer: Endometrial carcinoma that is pMMR (Mismatch Repair-Proficient)/MSS and is advanced, recurrent, or persistent and has relapsed or is refractory to curative therapy.\n* All patients must have at least one measurable lesion according to RECIST v1.1\n* Further inclusion criteria apply\n\nExclusion Criteria\n\nMaster Protocol:\n\n* Any investigational treatment anti-tumour treatment within 4 weeks or within 5 half-life periods (whichever is shorter) prior to the initiation of trial treatment.\n* More than one anti-PD-(L)1-based treatment regimen prior to entering study\n* Major surgery ('major' according to the Investigator's assessment) performed within 12 weeks prior to first trial treatment or planned within 12 months after screening, e.g., hip replacement.\n* Known history of severe hypersensitivity reactions to other mAbs or known hypersensitivity to the trial drugs or their excipients.\n* Presence of central nervous system (CNS) metastases, unless treated and asymptomatic and off corticosteroids and/or anticonvulsant therapy for at least 2 weeks prior to start of treatment.\n* Immunosuppressive corticosteroid doses (>10 mg prednisone daily or equivalent) within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment.\n* Active autoimmune disease or a documented history of autoimmune disease, except vitiligo or resolved childhood asthma/atopy. Patients who were permanently discontinued from previous anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy because of a immune-related adverse event (irAE).\n\nModule A:\n\n- Previous treatment with an anti-LAG-3 Agent\n\nModule C:\n\n* Unresolved, Grade >1 toxicity before the start of treatment with the study drug except for hair loss (alopecia) and hypothyroidism that requires thyroid hormone supplements but is asymptomatic under therapy.\n* Significant cardiovascular/cerebrovascular diseases (i.e. uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina, history of infarction within past 6 months, congestive heart failure > New York Heart Association [NYHA] II)\n* History of severe haemorrhagic or thromboembolic event in the past 12 months\n* Known inherited predisposition to bleeding or to thrombosis, in the opinion of the investigator - Further exclusion criteria apply\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
