    "exclusion_criteria": "* Subject has RLS that is known to be caused by another diagnosed condition (i.e. secondary RLS).\n* Subject was misdiagnosed with RLS, as determined by the investigator (e.g. actual diagnosis of Periodic Leg Movement Disorder (PLMD), arthritis, leg spasms or neuropathy without comorbid RLS).\n* Subject has primary sleep disorder other than RLS that significantly interferes with sleep at the present time (e.g. unmanaged sleep apnea or general insomnia).\n* Subject has been diagnosed with one of the following conditions at any time: Epilepsy or other seizure disorder, Severe movement disorder symptoms (Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, dyskinesia, dystonia), Deep Vein Thrombosis, Multiple sclerosis\n* Subject has an active diagnosis of one of the following conditions: Acute or chronic infection other than viral upper respiratory tract infections, Stage 4-5 chronic kidney disease or renal failure, Iron-deficient anemia, Severe edema affecting lower legs\n* Subject has any of the following at the location of device application: Acute injury, Cellulitis, Open sores\n* Subject has a malignancy within the past 5 years (not including basal or squamous cell skin cancer)\n* Subject is on dialysis or anticipated to start dialysis while participating in the study\n* Subject has severe peripheral neuropathy affecting the lower legs and/or subject has neuropathy and is unable to clearly distinguish between symptoms of neuropathy and symptoms of RLS.\n* During NPNS calibration, subject has a sensation threshold above the upper-cutoff value (e.g. 30mA), the subject finds stimulation intensities less than 15 mA to be uncomfortable or distracting, or the device does not properly fit the subject.\n* Subject has significantly changed dose or schedule of a medication that may impact RLS symptoms within the 30 days prior to enrollment, as judged by the investigator (e.g. antidepressants, sleep medications, sedative antihistamines).\n* Subject has received an investigational drug or device within the last 30 days or is planning to receive an investigational device during the duration of the study.\n* Subject has another medical condition that may affect validity of the study as determined by the investigator.\n* Subject is unable or unwilling to comply with study requirements.\n* Moderate or severe cognitive disorder or mental illness.\n* Subject has prior experience with Noctrix Health NPNS devices.\n* Subject has active implantable medical devices anywhere in the body (including pacemakers), or metal implant at the site of study device electrode application.\n* Subject has known allergy to electrode gel, polyurethane foam, or lycra.\n* Subject is pregnant or trying to become pregnant.\n* Subject has undergone a major surgery (excluding dental work) in the previous 30 days.\n* Subject has another medical condition that may put the subject at risk as determined by the investigator.",
