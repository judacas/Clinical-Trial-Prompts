Subject is receiving bone marrow stimulatory factors (e.g., granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF]). Note: Hormonal therapy for someone with a history of cancer treated with curative intent is permitted if subject has been on hormonal therapy > 1 year\n* Vaccination with live attenuated vaccines within 4 weeks of study agent administration\n* A diagnosis of primary amyloidosis, plasma cell leukemia, Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, or POEMS\n* Severe persistent asthma (forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1] < 60% and/or daily symptoms) or severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) defined clinically or by historical pulmonary function tests with an FEV1 < 50% predicted\n* Subject has known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to monoclonal antibodies or human proteins, or their excipients (refer to respective package inserts or investigator's brochure). Patients with a history of infusion reactions to daratumumab with prior treatment that resolved with supportive measures and in whom daratumumab therapy was not previously discontinued because of infusion reactions are permitted\n* Subject has uncontrolled human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), chronic or active hepatitis B, or active hepatitis A or C\n\n  * Patients with HIV are eligible unless their CD4+ T-cell counts are < 350 cells/mcL or they have a history of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining opportunistic infection within the 12 months prior to registration.
