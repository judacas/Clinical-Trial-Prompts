The length of time required to continue contraception for each study intervention is as follows: Olaparib, platinum doublet, and radiotherapy: 90 days\n* A female participant is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant, not breastfeeding, and agrees to use contraception and refrain from donating eggs (ova, oocytes) to others or freeze/store for her own use for the purpose of reproduction during the treatment period and for at least the time needed to eliminate each study intervention after the last dose of study intervention and agrees to abstain from breastfeeding during the study intervention period and for at least 120 days after the last dose of study intervention.
