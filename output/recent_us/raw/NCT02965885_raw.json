    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Must be ≥ 18 years of age.\n2. Must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status of 0 or 1.\n3. Must have a confirmed diagnosis of high-grade serous epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer.\n4. Must have relapsed after 1 prior line of platinum-based chemotherapy.\n5. Must have platinum-sensitive disease defined as radiographic progression greater than 6 months from last dose of platinum-based chemotherapy.\n\n   Note: Progression should be calculated from the date of the last administered dose of platinum therapy to the date of the radiographic imaging showing progression.\n6. If available locally and is the standard of care, breast cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA) testing on the tumor or prior germline testing is required for eligibility, and will need to be done prior to study entry. Somatic and germline BRCA-positive participants must have received prior treatment with a poly adenosine phosphate-ribose polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) unless documented as clinically contraindicated.\n7. Must have at least 1 lesion that meets the definition of measurable disease by RECIST v1.1 (radiologically measured by the investigator).\n8. Must provide an archival tumor tissue block or slides, or undergo procedure to obtain a new biopsy using a low-risk, medically routine procedure for immunohistochemistry (IHC) confirmation of FRα positivity; FRα-expressing tumors will be defined and classified by the Ventana FOLR1 Assay into low, medium, and high expressions defined as 25%-49%, 50%-74%, and ≥ 75% of tumor cells with PS2+ staining intensity, respectively. Must have confirmation of FRα positivity of ≥ 25% of tumor staining at ≥ 2+ intensity for entry into the study.\n9. Must have stabilized or recovered (Grade 1 or baseline) from all prior therapy-related toxicities (except alopecia) and have discontinued any maintenance therapy at least 4 weeks before the first dose of carboplatin plus MIRV.\n10. Must have completed any major surgery at least 4 weeks before the first dose of carboplatin plus MIRV and have recovered or stabilized from the side effects of prior surgery before the first dose of carboplatin plus MIRV.\n11. Must have adequate hematologic, liver, and kidney functions defined as:\n\n    1. Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 × 10^9/ liter(L) (1500/ microliter [μL]) without granulocyte colony-stimulating factor or long-acting white blood cell growth factors in the 10 days prior to the Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1) dose\n    2. Platelet count ≥ 100 × 109/L (100,000/μL) without platelet transfusion in the 10 days prior to the C1D1 dose\n    3. Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 grams/deciliter (g/dL) without packed red blood cell transfusion in the 14 days prior to the C1D1 dose\n    4. Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN)\n    5. Aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase ≤ 3.0 × ULN\n    6. Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × ULN (participants with documented diagnosis of Gilbert syndrome are eligible if total bilirubin < 3.0 × ULN)\n    7. Serum albumin ≥ 2 g/dL\n12. Must be willing and able to sign the informed consent form (ICF) and to adhere to the protocol requirements.\n13. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must agree to use highly effective contraceptive method(s) while on study medication and for at least 3 months after the last dose of MIRV and 6 months after the last dose of carboplatin.\n14. FCBP must have a negative pregnancy test within the 4 days prior to the C1D1 dose.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be FEMALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",

More than one line of prior chemotherapy. Lines of prior anticancer therapy are counted with the following considerations:\n\n   1. Neoadjuvant ± adjuvant therapies are considered 1 line of therapy if the neoadjuvant and adjuvant correspond to 1 fully predefined regimen; otherwise, they are counted as 2 prior regimens.\n   2. Maintenance therapy (eg, bevacizumab, PARPi) will be considered part of the preceding line of therapy (ie, not counted independently).\n3. Participants with prior wide-field radiotherapy affecting at least 20% of the bone marrow\n4. Participants with > Grade 1 peripheral neuropathy per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)\n5. Participants with active or chronic corneal disorders, history of corneal transplantation, or active ocular conditions requiring ongoing treatment/monitoring, such as uncontrolled glaucoma, wet age-related macular degeneration requiring intravitreal injections, active diabetic retinopathy with macular edema, macular degeneration, presence of papilledema, or monocular vision\n6. Participants with serious concurrent illness or clinically relevant active infection, including, but not limited to the following:\n\n   1. Active hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV)or C infection (whether or not on active antiviral therapy)\n   2. HIV infection if inclusion clarifying eligibility for HIV positive participants is not met\n   3. Active cytomegalovirus infection\n   4.
