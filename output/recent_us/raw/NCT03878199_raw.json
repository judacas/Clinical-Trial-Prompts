    "exclusion_criteria": "* Subject has been diagnosed with or treated for another malignancy whose natural history or treatment may interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen.\n* Subject has active central nervous system (CNS) involvement by their B-NHL. Subjects may be eligible with a distant history of CNS involvement that has been adequately treated with no evidence of recurrence within last 6 months from screening.\n* Subject has a history of leukemic presentation of their B-NHL.\n* Subject has history or presence of clinically significant CNS pathology\n* Subject has CNS involvement from active or history of autoimmune disease.\n* Subject received CD19 CAR T therapy within 3 months prior to first dose.\n* Subject experienced Grade ≥ 3 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) following prior T-cell engager (TCE) or CAR T-cell therapy.\n* Subject experienced Grade ≥ 2 neurotoxicity/immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) following prior TCE or CAR T-cell therapy.\n* Subject has received a peripheral autologous stem cell transplant (SCT) within 12 weeks, or an allogeneic SCT within 1 year of the first dose of study drug treatment or has received an SCT and requires ongoing immunosuppressive therapy.\n* Subjects with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, or subjects with chronic or active infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV). HIV-infected patients on effective anti-retroviral therapy with undetectable viral load within 6 months are eligible for this trial. Subjects with chronic HBV may be enrolled if the HBV viral load is undetectable on suppressive therapy, or if the subject has a documented cure.
