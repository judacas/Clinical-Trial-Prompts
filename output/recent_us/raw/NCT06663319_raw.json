For the purposes of this study measurable disease is defined at least one \"target lesion\" that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest dimension to be recorded). Each target lesion must be >20 mm when measured by conventional techniques, including palpation, plain x-ray, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or >10 mm when measured by spiral CT. The target lesion must be distinct from other tumor areas selected for pre-treatment biopsies. Pre- treatment imaging must be performed within 4 weeks of starting therapy. 7. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. 8. Adequate normal organ and marrow function as defined below.\n\n1. Hemoglobin ≥9.0 g/dL.\n2. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) > 1500/mm3.\n3. Platelet count ≥100 x 109/L (>75,000/mm3).\n4. Serum bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN. This will not apply to patients with confirmed Gilbert's syndrome (persistent or recurrent hyperbilirubinemia that is predominantly unconjugated in the absence of hemolysis or hepatic pathology), who will be allowed only in consultation with their physician.\n5. AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) ≤2.5 x ULN unless liver metastases are present, in which case it must be\n\n   * 5x ULN.\n6. Measured creatinine clearance (CL) >40 mL/min or Calculated creatinine CL>40 mL/min by the Cockcroft-Gault formula (Cockcroft and Gault 1976) or by 24-hour urine collection for determination of creatinine clearance: Creatinine CL (mL/min)\n\n   * Weight (kg) x (140 - Age) x 0.85 72 x serum creatinine (mg/dL) 9. Evidence of post-menopausal status or negative serum pregnancy test for female pre-menopausal patients.\n\nWomen will be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrhoeic for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. The following age-specific requirements apply:\n\n1. Women <50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrhoeic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal treatments and if they have luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone levels in the post- menopausal range for the institution or underwent surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy).\n2. Women ≥50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrhoeic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments, had radiation-induced menopause with last menses >1 year ago, had chemotherapy-induced menopause with last menses >1 year ago, or underwent surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or hysterectomy). 10. Has primary central nervous system (CNS) malignancy or known unrelated/active CNS metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n1. Subjects with previously treated, asymptomatic brain metastases may participate provided they meet the following criteria: clinically stable for at least 4 weeks and have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases and are off steroids 14 days prior to dosing with study medication. Stable brain metastases by this definition should be established prior to the first dose of study drug.\n2. Subjects with asymptomatic brain metastases (ie, no neurological symptoms, no requirements for corticosteroids, and no lesion >1.5 cm) may participate but will require regular imaging of the brain as a site of disease.\n3. Subjects with CNS symptoms should undergo a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain to exclude new or progressive brain metastases. Spinal cord metastasis is acceptable. However, subjects with spinal cord compression must be excluded.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "Exclusion criteria will be assessed within 28 days of starting study treatment and is listed below.\n\n1. Participation in another clinical study with an investigational product during the last 28 days.\n2. Prior treatment with CD137 agonists, anti-TIGIT antibody, anti-CTLA-4 or anti-PDL1/PD1 antibodies.\n3. Concurrent enrollment in another clinical study, unless it is an observational (non-interventional) clinical study or during the follow-up period of an interventional study.\n4. Receipt of the last dose of anticancer therapy (chemotherapy, immunotherapy, endocrine therapy, targeted therapy, biologic therapy, tumor embolization, monoclonal antibodies) ≤28 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter, prior to the first dose of study drug. If sufficient wash-out time has not occurred due to the schedule or PK properties of an agent, a longer wash-out period will be required, as agreed by study sponsors and the investigator.\n5. Any unresolved toxicity NCI CTCAE Grade ≥2 from previous anticancer therapy with the exception of alopecia, vitiligo, and the laboratory values defined in the inclusion criteria.\n\n   1. Patients with Grade ≥2 neuropathy will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis after consultation with the primary investigator.\n   2. Patients with irreversible toxicity not reasonably expected to be exacerbated by treatment with investigational therapy may be included only after consultation with the primary investigator.\n6.

Active infection including tuberculosis (clinical evaluation that includes clinical history, physical examination and radiographic findings, and TB testing in line with local practice), hepatitis B (known positive HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) result), hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus (positive HIV 1/2 antibodies).
