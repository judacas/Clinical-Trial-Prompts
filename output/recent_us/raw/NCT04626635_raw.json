    "official_title": "Reducing the Incidence of Symptomatic Brain Metastases With MRI Surveillance in Non-Squamous Locally Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Age â‰¥ 18 years of age.\n* Patients with non-squamous locally advanced lung cancer defined by American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) version 8 stage IIIA, IIIB, or IIIC disease.\n* Histology described as adeno-squamous or not otherwise specified favoring squamous are eligible.\n* Patients may be enrolled before or after the start of radiation therapy but must be enrolled and have their first surveillance MRI brain at 120 +/- 10 days of their first treatment of radiation therapy for their locally advanced lung cancer. The first radiation treatment is defined as day 1.\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 - 3.\n* Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) > 30 mL/min/1.73m2.\n* Patients must be eligible for a brain MRI per the Wake Forest MRI safety screening checklist questionnaire. This will be completed by a MRI imaging technician, enrolling physician, CPDM staff member, a magnetic resonance safety officer, and/or a radiologist as indicated in the form.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Known brain metastases on staging MRI.\n* Questionable findings that may represent a differential of vasculature abnormalities/stroke/ and or metastatic disease with recommended short interval follow-up are not an exclusion factor for study participation. The recommended follow-up imaging for such findings should have no bearing on the imaging schedule in this protocol, and this research protocol imaging should NOT serve as an official follow-up scan for such findings.\n* Patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding.\n* Premenopausal persons of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 14 days of enrollment. If women are not of childbearing potential as defined by women who are menopausal female or has had a hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or medically-documented ovarian failure, they will not require a pregnancy test. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.",
