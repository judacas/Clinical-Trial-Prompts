    "official_title": "Examination of Pirfenidone (Esbriet®) Therapy in Coal Workers' Pneumoconiosis With Pulmonary Fibrosis Associated With Radiographic and Functional Impairment to Examine the Reduction in Progression of Disease, Reduction of Exacerbation Rates and Possible Reduction of Inflammatory Biomarkers as an Index of Clinical Response.",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* 1. Able and willing to provide informed consent and to comply with study protocol\n* 2. Coal miners between the ages 40 to 79 years of age at visit 1with a minimum of 15 years in a coal mining environment\n* 3. Chest CT Scan or Chest Xray (within 6 months) confirming diagnosis of CWP, complicated black lung disease/progressive massive fibrosis will be recorded. If CT not available must be obtained at Visit 1.\n* 4. Evidence of Loss of lung function defined by decline in FEV1 or FVC or DLCO of 5% within the past 36 months prior to enrollment.\n* 5. FEV1 ≤ 75% or FVC ≤ 80% or DLCO ≤ 70% or abnormal 6MWT with oxygen desaturation of 4% or greater than resting at screening or within past 6 months.\n* 6. Former smokers and current smokers will be enrolled if documented evidence of CWP/PMF is present and meet PFT guidelines. Current smokers will be given smoking cessation counseling at each visit due to the effect on pirfenidone concentration and efficacy.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 40 Years\nMust have maximum age of 79 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* 1. History of prior therapy with Esbriet or Ofev (pirfenidone or nintedanib)\n* 2. Recent hospitalization (within 30 days prior to screening) for respiratory decompensation.\n* 3. Patients using monoclonal antibody therapy or immunosuppressive therapy for other disease process will be excluded, except for the following:\n\n  * Daily prednisone up to 10 mg daily (prescribed for lung disease or rheumatoid arthritis) will be permitted. Chronic use for 3 months prior to enrollment will be documented.\n  * Methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis will be permitted as long as chronic use for 6 months prior to enrollment is documented.\n* 4. Elevation of liver function test at screening documenting AST, ALT or total bilirubin > 3 x ULN or ALP > 2.5 x ULN.\n* 5. Patients who have other pulmonary pathology such as lung cancer, active tuberculosis or atypical mycobacterial infection requiring treatment.\n* 6. Patients with recurrent malignancy requiring chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Individuals with a prior diagnosis of localized skin cancer, prostate cancer, localized bladder cancer will not be excluded unless undergoing active treatment. Patients with a prior diagnosis of malignancy treated greater than 5 years ago will be considered for enrollment.\n* 7. History of alcohol or drug abuse that would impair or risk the patient's full participation in the drug study in the opinion of the investigator\n* 8. Use of any investigational therapy within 4 weeks of enrollment.\n* 9. Individuals with clinically significant unstable cardiac disease (ejection fraction ≤35%) or complex arrhythmias per PI discretion. Chronic atrial fibrillation will be permitted if heart rate is controlled. Historical values of ejection fraction will be accepted.\n* 10. Individuals with poorly controlled diabetes per PI discretion (Hemoglobin A1c >9). Historical values will be accepted.\n* 11. Pregnancy or lactation.",
