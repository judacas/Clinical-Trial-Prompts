Any investigational agents or study interventions from a previous clinical study within 5 half lives or 3 weeks (whichever is longer) of the first dose of study treatment.\n  2. Any other anticancer treatment within the following time periods prior to the first dose of study treatment: (i) Cytotoxic and non-cytotoxic treatment: 3 weeks or 5 half-lives (whichever is shorter). (ii) Biological products including immuno-oncology agents: 4 weeks before enrolment.\n  3. Any live virus or bacterial vaccine within 28 days of the first dose of study treatment.\n* Any concurrent anticancer therapy or concurrent use of prohibited medications.\n* Major surgery within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment.\n* Radiotherapy with a wide field of radiation within 4 weeks or radiotherapy with a limited field of radiation for palliation within 2 weeks of the first dose of study treatment.\n* With the exception of alopecia, and peripheral neuropathy; any unresolved toxicities from prior therapy greater than Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade 1 at the time of study enrolment.\n* Any history of persisting (> 2 weeks) severe pancytopenia.\n* Spinal cord compression, or brain metastases unless asymptomatic and treated and stable.\n* Any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic diseases, including, active bleeding diatheses, or active infection including hepatitis B, hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).\n* Patients with any known predisposition to bleeding (eg, active peptic ulceration, recent [within 6 months] haemorrhagic stroke, proliferative diabetic retinopathy.\n* Any clinically significant cardiac disorders including QT prolongation, abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG).\n* Any clinically significant cardiovascular diseases including symptomatic heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, acute coronary syndrome, cardiomyopathy, valvular heart disease, atrial fibrillation, stroke.\n* Patients with history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/ acute myeloid leukaemia (AML).\n* Refractory nausea and vomiting, chronic gastrointestinal diseases, inability to swallow the formulated product or previous significant bowel resection.\n* Known allergy or hypersensitivity to investigational product(s) or any of the excipients of the investigational product(s).\n* Any condition that would interfere with evaluation of the study treatment or interpretation of patient safety or study results.\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness within the last 12 months, including but not limited to, active interstitial lung disease, serious chronic gastrointestinal (GI) conditions associated with diarrhoea, or psychiatric illness/social situations\n* History of another primary malignancy except for malignancy treated with curative intent with no known active disease within 3 years before the first dose of study treatment and of low potential risk for recurrence.\n* Concurrent enrolment in another clinical study, unless it is an observational (non-interventional) clinical study or during the follow-up period of an interventional study.\n* Arm 1 (Enzalutamide) and Arm 4 (Apalutamide): History of seizure or any condition that may predispose to seizure (eg, prior cortical stroke, significant brain trauma).\n* Arm 2 (Abiraterone acetate) only: (i) Active infection or other medical condition that would contraindicate the use of systemic steroids (prednisone/prednisolone). (ii) Low serum potassium (< 3.5 mmol/L). (iii) History of uncontrolled pituitary or adrenal dysfunction.\n* Arm 4 (Apalutamide): (i) Moderate or severe skin conditions or diseases that could affect the skin (eg. scleroderma, lupus).
