Patients on dialysis are not eligible\n* The effects of ibrutinib and epcoritamab on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (double barrier method of birth control or abstinence) 2 weeks before initiation of treatment, for the duration of study participation and for 12 months after completing treatment. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect that she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform the treating physician immediately. Men must agree to refrain from sperm donation for at least 12 months after the last dose of epcoritamab\n* Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum (beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [β-hCG]) or urine pregnancy test at Screening. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding are ineligible for this study\n* Patients must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) consent document. Voluntary written consent must be given before the performance of any study-related procedure not part of standard medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn by the patient at any time without prejudice to future medical care\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Prior therapy with a bispecific antibody targeting CD3 and CD20\n* Prior lymphoma therapy should be completed greater than two weeks before the start of protocol therapy, except for corticosteroids used for palliation of symptoms\n* Patients who require immediate cytoreductive therapy for their lymphoma per the treating physician's assessment are ineligible\n* Patients with a history of allogeneic stem cell transplantation are excluded unless the transplant was > 180 days before the first scheduled dose of ibrutinib AND the patient does not have evidence of active acute or chronic graft versus host disease AND the patient must not have taken immunosuppressive medications associated with the transplant for at least 1 month before the first scheduled dose of ibrutinib\n* Ongoing systemic treatment with a strong CYP3A inhibitor or inducer. Treatment with any strong CYP3A inhibitor or inducer needs to be stopped for 5 half-lives prior to starting treatment on trial\n* Major surgery within 4 weeks before the start of treatment other than surgery performed for lymphoma diagnosis\n* Known active central nervous system (CNS) involvement by lymphoma. Patients who are enrolled and subsequently identified to have pathologic confirmation of CNS involvement by lymphoma may be continued on the study at the discretion of the principal investigator\n* Active uncontrolled infection or infection requiring intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy for > 2 consecutive days within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug\n* Evidence of current uncontrolled or symptomatic cardiovascular conditions, including, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmias, history of or symptomatic congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class III or greater), unstable angina, or myocardial infarction within the past 6 months. Poorly controlled or clinically significant atherosclerotic vascular disease including angioplasty, cardiac or vascular stenting within 6 months of enrollment\n* Known liver cirrhosis with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B or C)\n* Clinically significant pulmonary disease or history of bronchospasm requiring intubation, or clinically significant active interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis\n* History of cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack within the 6 months before day 1, cycle 1 of treatment\n* Any prior history of intracranial hemorrhage\n* Clinically significant known bleeding diatheses or platelet dysfunction disorders.\n* Receiving treatment with coumadin/warfarin\n* Known gastrointestinal disease or gastrointestinal procedure that will significantly interfere with the oral absorption or tolerance of ibrutinib including the inability to swallow pills/capsules\n* Any serious medical or psychiatric illness that could, in the investigator's opinion, potentially interfere with the completion of treatment according to this protocol\n* Known allergy to any of the study medications, their analogues, or excipients in the various formulations of any agent\n* Prior solid organ transplant\n* History of other malignancies that could affect compliance with the protocol or interpretation of results in the opinion of the investigator\n* Participation in other interventional clinical trials, including those with other investigational agents not included in this trial, within 21 days of the first scheduled dose of ibrutinib (cycle 1 day -7)\n* Known history of HIV, active hepatitis C infection (HCV ribonucleic acid [RNA] polymerase chain reaction [PCR]-positive) and/or active hepatitis B infections (HBV DNA PCR-positive). If hepatitis B core (HBc) antibody is positive, the patient must be evaluated for the presence of HBV DNA by PCR. If HCV antibody is positive, the patient must be evaluated for the presence of HCV RNA by PCR. Patients with positive HBc antibody and negative HBV DNA by PCR are eligible. Patients with positive HCV antibody and negative HCV RNA by PCR are eligible\n* Pregnant or breastfeeding women are excluded from this study. Because there is an unknown, but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with ibrutinib or epcoritamab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with ibrutinib or epcoritamab\n* Patients with ongoing clinically significant grade ≥ 2 toxicity from prior therapy",
