    "official_title": "TBCRC 042 - a Randomized Phase II Window-of-Opportunity Trial of Ruxolitinib in Patients with High Risk and Premalignant Breast Conditions",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Have a breast biopsy showing ADH (atypical ductal hyperplasia), ALH (atypical lobular hyperplasia), LCIS (lobular carcinoma in situ), or DCIS (ductal carcinoma in situ) requiring surgical excision. Microinvasive disease is allowed.\n\n  * NOTE: Tissue from the diagnostic biopsy must be accessible/available for research correlates (i.e., a tissue block or ~10 unstained slides). Due to the nature of the study, fewer slides may be accepted with prior permission from the Protocol Chair if there is insufficient tissue.\n* Women and men age 18 and older.\n* Adequate hematologic and organ function, defined as follows:\n\n  * Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1500/mm3\n  * Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL\n  * Platelet levels >200 x 109/L\n  * Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)\n  * AST/ALT ≤ 2.5 x institutional ULN\n  * Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 5 x institutional ULN\n  * Creatinine clearance > 50 mL/min as calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault method\n* Willing to not use concomitant strong CYP3A4 inhibitors as this could interfere with the metabolism of ruxolitinib (i.e azole antifungals, clarithromycin, conivaptan, grapefruit juice, mibefradil, nefazodone, protease inhibitors, telithromycin).\n* Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation.\n* If the patient undergoes germline genetic testing, the results must be received prior to randomization, as the results may affect the surgical approach and, in turn, the date of surgical excision.\n* Patient understands the study regimen, its requirements, risks, and discomforts, and is able and willing to sign a written informed consent document.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Treatment with selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) or aromatase inhibitors for breast cancer prevention within 1 year prior to starting study treatment.\n* Treatment with any other investigational agents within 30 days of starting study treatment.\n* Current diagnosis of invasive breast cancer (current microinvasive disease is allowed), or previous history of invasive breast cancer diagnosed within the last 5 years.\n\nNOTE: If previous history of ER+ invasive breast cancer diagnosed > 5 years ago, patient must be off endocrine therapy for at least 1 year prior to starting study treatment.\n\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, end stage renal disease (ESRD), or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* Women who are pregnant or nursing.\n* HIV-positive participants on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with ruxolitinib.\n* Prior or current treatment with a JAK inhibitor, for any indication.\n* Known active Hepatitis B or C.",
