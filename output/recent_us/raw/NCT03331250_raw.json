    "official_title": "SORAYA: A Phase 3, Single Arm Study of Mirvetuximab Soravtansine in Platinum-Resistant, Advanced High-Grade Epithelial Ovarian, Primary Peritoneal, or Fallopian Tube Cancers With High Folate Receptor-Alpha Expression",
    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Female participants ≥ 18 years of age\n2. Participants must have a confirmed diagnosis of high-grade serous epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), primary peritoneal cancer, or fallopian tube cancer\n3. Participants must have platinum-resistant disease:\n\n   1. Participants who have only had 1 line of platinum based therapy must have received at least 4 cycles of platinum, must have had a response (complete response/remission [CR] or partial response/remission [PR]) and then progressed between > 3 months and ≤ 6 months after the date of the last dose of platinum\n   2. Participants who have received 2 or 3 lines of platinum therapy must have progressed on or within 6 months after the date of the last dose of platinum\n\n   Note: Progression should be calculated from the date of the last administered dose of platinum therapy to the date of the radiographic imaging showing progression\n\n   Note: Participants who are platinum refractory during front-line treatment are excluded (see exclusion criteria)\n4. Participants must have progressed radiographically on or after their most recent line of anticancer therapy.\n5. Participants must be willing to provide an archival tumor tissue block or slides, or undergo procedure to obtain a new biopsy using a low-risk, medically routine procedure for immunohistochemistry (IHC) confirmation of Folate Receptor α (FRα) positivity\n6. Participant's tumor must be positive for FRα expression as defined by the Ventana FOLR1 Assay\n7. Participants must have at least 1 lesion that meets the definition of measurable disease by RECIST v1.1 (radiologically measured by the Investigator)\n8. Participants must have received at least 1 but no more than 3 prior systemic lines of anticancer therapy, including at least 1 line of therapy containing bevacizumab, and for whom single-agent therapy is appropriate as the next line of treatment:\n\n   1. Adjuvant ± neoadjuvant considered 1 line of therapy\n   2. Maintenance therapy (e.g., bevacizumab, poly adenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors) will be considered part of the preceding line of therapy (i.e., not counted independently)\n   3. Therapy changed due to toxicity in the absence of progression will be considered part of the same line (i.e., not counted independently)\n   4. Hormonal therapy will be counted as a separate line of therapy unless it was given as maintenance\n9. Participants must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) of 0 or 1\n10. Participants must have completed prior therapy within the specified times below:\n\n    1. Systemic antineoplastic therapy within 5 half-lives or 4 weeks (whichever is shorter) prior to first dose of MIRV\n    2. Focal radiation completed at least 2 weeks prior to first dose of MIRV\n11. Participants must have stabilized or recovered (Grade 1 or baseline) from all prior therapy-related toxicities (except alopecia)\n12. Participants must have completed any major surgery at least 4 weeks prior to first dose of MIRV and have recovered or stabilized from the side effects of prior surgery\n13. Participants must have adequate hematologic, liver and kidney functions defined as:\n\n    1. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 10^9/L (1,500/μL) without G-CSF in the prior 10 days or long-acting WBC growth factors in the prior 20 days\n    2. Platelet count ≥ 100 x 10^9/L (100,000/μL) without platelet transfusion in the prior 10 days\n    3. Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL without packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusion in the prior 21 days\n    4. Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN)\n    5. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 3.0 x ULN\n    6. Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN (patients with documented diagnosis of Gilbert syndrome are eligible if total bilirubin < 3.0 x ULN)\n    7. Serum albumin ≥ 2 g/dL\n14. Participants or their legally authorized representative must be willing and able to sign the informed consent form (ICF) and to adhere to the protocol requirements\n15. Women of childbearing potential (WCBP) must agree to use highly effective contraceptive method(s) while on MIRV and for at least 3 months after the last dose\n16. WCBP must have a negative pregnancy test within the 4 days prior to the first dose of MIRV\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be FEMALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Male participants\n2. Participants with endometrioid, clear cell, mucinous, or sarcomatous histology, mixed tumors containing any of the above histologies, or low-grade/borderline ovarian tumor\n3. Participants with primary platinum-refractory disease, defined as disease that did not respond to (CR or PR) or has progressed within 3 months of the last dose of first-line platinum-containing chemotherapy\n4. Participants with prior wide-field radiotherapy (RT) affecting at least 20 percent of the bone marrow\n5. Participants with > Grade 1 peripheral neuropathy per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)\n6. Participants with active or chronic corneal disorders, history of corneal transplantation, or active ocular conditions requiring ongoing treatment/monitoring, such as uncontrolled glaucoma, wet age-related macular degeneration requiring intravitreal injections, active diabetic retinopathy with macular edema, macular degeneration, presence of papilledema, and /or monocular vision\n7. Participants with serious concurrent illness or clinically relevant active infection, including, but not limited to the following:\n\n   1.
