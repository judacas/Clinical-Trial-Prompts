    "inclusion_criteria": "* INCLUSION CRITERIA:\n* Patients must have histologically documented solid tumors whose disease has progressed on standard therapy or for which there is no available standard therapy.\n* Age greater than or equal to 18 years of age.\n* ECOG performance status < 2\n* Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:\n\n  * absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1,500/mcL\n  * platelets greater than or equal to100,000/mcL\n  * total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 X institutional upper limit of normal (<=3 x upper limit of normal in the presence of documented Gilbert s syndrome)\n  * AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) less than or equal to 3 X institutional upper limit of normal\n\nOR\n\n* AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) less than or equal to 5 X institutional upper limit of normal for patients with liver metastases\n* creatinine less than or equal to 1.5X institutional upper limit of normal\n\nOR\n\n* creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels above 1.5X institutional normal\n\n  * Because nucleoside analogs are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use two forms of contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence; sterilization) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for 3 months after completing study treatment. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use two forms of contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and for 3 months after completion of administration of Aza-TdC.\n  * Patients must have completed any chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or biologic therapy greater than or equal to 4 weeks or 5 half-lives (whichever is shorter) (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study. Patients must be greater than or equal to 2 weeks since any prior palliative radiation or cyberknife therapy. Patients must have recovered to grade 1 from prior toxicity or adverse events. Patients with bone metastases or hypercalcemia on intravenous bisphosphonate treatment prior to study entry may continue this treatment.\n  * Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n  * Willingness to provide blood and urine samples for research purposes.\n  * Ability to swallow pills/capsules.\n  * Left ventricular ejection fraction greater than 45% or the institutional lower limit of normal by either ECHO or MUGA at entry.\n  * For patients enrolled on the expansion cohort, patients must have tumor amenable to biopsy (excisional or incision biopsies of skin or H & N lesions under visualization) and willingness to undergo tumor biopsies.\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\n* Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.\n* Pregnant women and women who are breastfeeding are excluded from this study.\n* Patients with clinically significant illnesses which would compromise participation in the study, including, but not limited to active or uncontrolled infection, immune deficiencies, known HIV infection requiring protease inhibitor therapy, known Hepatitis B, known Hepatitis C, uncontrolled diabetes, uncontrolled hypertension, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, myocardial infarction within the past 6 months, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* Patients with known brain metastases or carcinomatous meningitis are excluded from this clinical trial, with the exception of patients whose brain metastatic disease status has remained stable for greater than or equal to 1 month after treatment of the brain metastases.Patients should not be on anti-seizure medications. These patients may be enrolled at the discretion of the Principal Investigator.\n* Malabsorption syndrome or other conditions that would interfere with intestinal absorption.\n\nINCLUSION OF WOMEN AND MINORITIES:\n\nBoth men and women of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this trial.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 120 Years",
