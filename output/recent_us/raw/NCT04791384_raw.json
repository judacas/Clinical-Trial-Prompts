    "exclusion_criteria": "* Progression within 6 months of curatively intended systemic therapy given for locoregionally advanced disease.\n* Investigational therapy within 28 days of treatment start.\n* Prior systemic therapy for recurrent or metastatic disease.\n* Known CNS metastases/leptomeningeal metastatic disease.\n* Other malignancy unless curatively treated with no evidence of disease for ≥ 2 years except: adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer, curative treated in situ cancer of the cervix, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), stage 1 grade 1 endometrial carcinoma; or low risk-disease per discretion of the PI.\n* A history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to olaparib, pembrolizumab, carboplatin, or other agents used in the study.\n* Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, andti-PD-L1, or anti PD-L2 agent or with an agent directed to another stimulatory or co-inhibitory T-cell receptor (e.g., CTLA-4, OX 40, CD137).\n* Has received prior radiotherapy within 2 weeks of start of study intervention. Participants must have recovered from all radiation-related toxicities, not require corticosteroids, and not have had radiation pneumonitis. A 1-week washout is permitted for palliative radiation (≤2 weeks of radiotherapy) to non-CNS disease.\n* Concomitant use of known strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., itraconazole, telithromycin, clarithromycin, protease inhibitors boosted with ritonavir or cobicistat, indinavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, boceprevir, telaprevir) or moderate CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, diltiazem, fluconazole, verapamil). The required washout period prior to starting olaparib is 2 weeks.\n* Concomitant use of known strong CYP3A inducers (e.g. phenobarbital, enzalutamide, phenytoin, rifampicin, rifabutin, rifapentine, carbamazepine, nevirapine, and St. John's wort) or moderate CYP3A inducers (e.g., bosentan, efavirenz, modafinil). The required washout period prior to starting olaparib is 5 weeks for enzalutamide or phenobarbital and 3 weeks for other agents.\n* Resting ECG indicating uncontrolled, potentially reversible cardiac conditions as judged by the investigator (e.g., unstable ischemia, uncontrolled symptomatic arrhythmia, congestive heart failure, QTcF prolongation > 500 ms, electrolyte disturbances, etc.) or patients with congenital long QT syndrome.\n* Diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia or with features suggestive of MDS/AML.\n* Major surgery within 2 weeks of starting study treatment; must have recovered from any effects of major surgery.\n* Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic corticosteroid therapy (in doses exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of treatment.\n* Received a live vaccine or live-attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of pembrolizumab. Administration of killed vaccines is allowed. Examples of live vaccines is allowed. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g. FluMist®) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.\n* Considered a poor medical risk due to a serious, uncontrolled medical disorder, non-malignant systemic disease, or active, uncontrolled infection. Examples include, but are not limited to, uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia, recent (within 3 months) myocardial infarction, uncontrolled major seizure disorder, unstable spinal cord compression, superior vena cava syndrome, extensive interstitial bilateral lung disease on high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan or any psychiatric disorder that prohibits obtaining informed consent.\n* Unable to swallow orally administered medication or with gastrointestinal disorder likely to interfere with absorption of study medication.\n* Pregnant and/or breastfeeding.
