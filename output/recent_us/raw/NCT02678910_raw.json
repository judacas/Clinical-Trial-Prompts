CNS inclusion criteria:\n\nBased on screening contrast brain MRI, patients must have one of the following:\n\n1. No evidence of brain metastases 2. Untreated brain metastases not needing immediate local therapy. For patients with untreated CNS lesions > 2.0 cm on screening contrast brain MRI, discussion with and approval from the medical monitor is required prior to enrollment 3. Previously treated brain metastases\n\na. Brain metastases previously treated with local therapy may either be stable since treatment or may have progressed since prior local CNS therapy, provided that there is no clinical indication for immediate re-treatment with local therapy in the opinion of the investigator b. Patients treated with CNS local therapy for newly identified lesions found on contrast brain MRI performed during screening for this study may be eligible to enroll if all of the following criteria are met: i. Time since WBRT is ≥ 21 days prior to first dose of treatment, time since surgical resection of CNS metastases is ≥ 14 days prior to the first dose of study treatment, or time since SRS is ≥ 7 days prior to first dose of treatment.\n\nii. Other sites of disease evaluable by RECIST 1.1 or RANO-BM are present c. Relevant records of any CNS treatment must be available to allow for classification of target and non-target lesions. 13. Adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:\n\n* Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm3\n* Platelets ≥ 75,000/mm3\n* Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 mg/dL without red blood cell transfusion ≤ 7 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 of therapy\n* Total serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X upper limit of normal (ULN) except for subjects with known Gilbert's disease, who may enroll if the conjugated bilirubin is ≤ 1.5 ULN\n* AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) ≤2.5 X ULN;\n* Serum creatinine Estimated creatinine clearance ≥50 mL/min as calculated by Cockroft-Gault formula; actual body weight must be used for creatinine clearance calculations unless BMI > 30 kg/m2 then lean body weight must be used;≤ 1.5 mg/dL\n* International normalized ratio (INR) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) ≤ 1.5 X ULN unless on medication known to alter INR and aPTT\n* Fasting blood glucose ≤140 mg/dL\n* HbA1C≤6.4%\n* Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 50% (as assessed by ECHO or MUGA) documented within 4 weeks prior to first dose of study treatment\n* Serum or urine pregnancy test (for women of childbearing potential, defined as premenopausal women who are not permanently sterile due to hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral tubal occlusion) negative ≤ 7 days of starting treatment 14. Patients with body mass index >25, or FBG 110-140mg/dL, or HbA1C 5.7 - 6.4% should be agreeable for low glycemic diet and lifestyle modifications, and consulted by nutritionist prior to initiation of the study drugs. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent and comply with the study scheduled visits, treatment plans, laboratory tests and other procedures.\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\n1. Patients with contraindications to undergo contrast MRI imaging of the brain are excluded from the study\n2. Pregnancy or breast feeding\n3. Any systemic anti-cancer therapy (including hormonal therapy or investigational agents) or surgery in <14 days prior to the first dose of study treatment WBRT in <21 days, SBRT for CNS disease in <7 days, or palliative radiation to extracranial sites in <14 days prior to the first dose of study treatment5.\n4. Based on screening brain MRI, patients must not have any of the following:\n\n1. Any untreated brain lesions > 2.0 cm in size, unless discussed with medical monitor and approval for enrollment is given 2. Ongoing use of systemic corticosteroids for control of symptoms of brain metastases at a total daily dose of > 2 mg of dexamethasone (or equivalent). However, patients on a chronic stable dose of ≤ 2 mg total daily of dexamethasone (or equivalent) may be eligible with discussion and approval by the medical monitor 3. Any brain lesion thought to require immediate local therapy, including (but not limited to) a lesion in an anatomic site where increase in size or possible treatment-related edema may pose risk to patient (e.g. brain stem lesions). Patients who undergo local treatment for such lesions identified by screening contrast brain MRI may still be eligible for the study based on criteria described under CNS inclusion criteria 3b 4. Known or suspected leptomeningeal disease as documented by the investigator 5. Have poorly controlled (> 1/week) generalized or complex partial seizures, or manifest neurologic progression due to brain metastases notwithstanding CNS-directed therapy 5.

More than 1 line of therapy containing tucatinib, lapatinib, neratinib, afatinib, pyrotinib, or other EGFR or HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor in the metastatic setting. Note: receiving the above medications for <30 days is not considered to be a \"line of therapy\". Adjuvant treatment with EGFR or HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors does not count.\n\n7. Previous treatment with alpelisib or other PI3K, mTOR or AKT inhibitor of more than 30 days duration.\n\n8. An established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus type I, or uncontrolled diabetes mellitus type II 9. History of acute pancreatitis within 1 year of screening, or a past medical history of chronic pancreatitis 10. History of severe cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions (Steven Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme or toxic epidermal necrolysis) 11.

Patients with history of treated and cured HCV infection may enroll if they have documented undetectable viral load.\n\n13. Known HIV infection with CD4+ T-cell (CD4+) counts < 350 cells/μL. Note: pretesting is not required. Patients with known HIV infection and CD4+ T-cell (CD4+) counts ≥ 350 cells/μL may enroll.\n\n14. Inability to swallow pills or any significant gastrointestinal disease which would preclude the adequate oral absorption of medications 15. Use of prohibited medications listed in the Appendix D (strong CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors, and strong CYP2C8 inducers or inhibitors) within 3 elimination half-lives prior to initiation of study treatments 16. Myocardial infarction, severe/unstable angina, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty/stenting (PTCA), or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) within 6 month of the first dose of the study treatment 17.

Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric conditions or laboratory abnormalities that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study drug administration, or may interfere with the interpretation of study results, or in the judgment of the investigator would make the subject inappropriate for entry into the study.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
