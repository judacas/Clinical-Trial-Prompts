    "exclusion_criteria": "* Receipt of intervening therapy after CAR T-cell infusion\n* History of another primary malignancy that has not been in remission for at least 1 year (with the exception of non-melanoma skin cancer, curatively treated localized prostate cancer, curatively treated superficial bladder cancer and cervical carcinoma in site on biopsy or a squamous intraepithelial lesion on papanicolaou [PAP] smear)\n* Active hepatitis B, hepatitis C at time of screening\n* Known (human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]) seropositivity\n* Subjects with uncontrolled infection\n* Concurrent use of other anticancer agents or experimental treatments\n* Active autoimmune disease requiring immunosuppressive therapy with the exception of vitiligo and autoimmune alopecia\n* Known active central nervous system (CNS) involvement\n* Subjects with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (> 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study drug administration. Inhaled or topical steroids, and adrenal replacement doses are permitted in absence of active autoimmune disease\n* Known history of any active infectious pneumonitis\n* Presence of acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) requiring active treatment unless limited to skin involvement and managed with topical steroid therapy alone\n* Has active cytokine release syndrome\n* Pregnancy or breastfeeding: Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (urine pregnancy test: minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of human chorionic gonadotropin [hCG]) within 14 days of the first dose of study drug.
