Patients with elevated bilirubin due to Gilbert's syndrome may be permitted with PI approval (e.g. total bilirubin <3 mg/dL and normal direct bilirubin).\n* Must be able to take acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) daily as prophylactic anticoagulation. Patients intolerant to ASA may use low molecular weight heparin, apixaban, rivaroxaban, or equivalent.\n* All study participants must be registered into the mandatory Pomalyst REMS program and be willing and able to comply with the requirements of the Pomalyst REMS program.\n* Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must adhere to the scheduled pregnancy testing as required in the Pomalyst REMS program and agree to use a highly effective method of contraception during the study for 4 months after the last dose of treatment in the study (see Appendix) and agrees not to donate eggs (ova, oocytes) for the purpose of reproduction during this period). A WOCBP must have a negative highly sensitive serum pregnancy test within 72 hours before the first dose of study intervention and agree to use a highly effective method of contraception during the study and for 4 months after the last dose of belantamab mafodotin. Note: non childbearing potential defined as follows (by other than medical reasons):\n\n  * ≥ 45 years of age and has not had menses for > 1 year\n  * Patients who have been amenorrhoeic for < 2 years without history of a hysterectomy and oophorectomy must have a follicle stimulating hormone value in the postmenopausal range upon screening evaluation\n  * Post-hysterectomy, post-bilateral oophorectomy, or post-tubal ligation. Documented hysterectomy or oophorectomy must be confirmed with medical records of the actual procedure or confirmed by an ultrasound. Tubal ligation must be confirmed with medical records of the actual procedure.\n* A man who is sexually active with a WOCBP (even if they have undergone a successful vasectomy) must agree to use a barrier method of birth control e.g. either condom with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository or partner with occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository for 6 months after receiving the last dose of study drug.\n* Male participants must refrain from donating sperm for 6 months after the last dose of study drug.\n* Able to swallow capsules whole (pomalidomide capsules cannot be crushed, dissolved or broken).\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Participant must not have had current corneal epithelial disease except mild changes in corneal epithelium.\n* Participant must not use contact lenses while participating in this study.\n* Participants who have had myeloma therapy or investigational drug within 2 weeks prior to start of treatment or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 2 weeks earlier.\n* Participants who are receiving any investigational agents.\n* Prior therapy with anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody within six months. No other multiple myeloma monoclonal antibody therapy within 30 days of start of study treatment.\n* Prior therapy with anti-BCMA therapy.\n* Plasmapheresis within seven days prior to start of study treatment.\n* Primary refractory disease.\n* Concomitant high dose corticosteroids. Low dose corticosteroids (maximum dose prednisone 10 mg/day or equivalent) are permitted if given for disorders other than myeloma, e.g. adrenal insufficiency, rheumatoid arthritis, etc.\n* Pregnancy or lactation or planned lactation (breastfeeding).\n* Prior history of malignancies, other than MM, unless the patient has completed definitive treatment and has been free of the disease for ≥ 3 years. Patients who are free of disease < 3 years may enroll after discussion with and approval of the PI.

Subjects with resolved infection (i.e., subjects who are HBsAg negative but positive for antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen [anti-HBc] and/or antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen [anti-HBs]) must be screened for hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA levels. Those with positive HBV viral load will be excluded. Exception: subjects with serologic findings suggestive of HBV vaccination (anti-HBs positivity as the only serologic marker) and a known history of prior HBV vaccination do not need testing for HBV DNA.\n* Seropositive for hepatitis C (except in the setting of a sustained virologic response, defined as aviremia at least 12 weeks after completion of antiviral therapy).\n* Peripheral neuropathy ≥ grade 2 despite supportive therapy.\n* Hypersensitivity to isatuximab, belantamab mafodotin, pomalidomide, or dexamethasone, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome.
