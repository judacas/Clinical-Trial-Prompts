    "exclusion_criteria": "* Any condition, including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which places the subject at unacceptable risk if he/she/they were to participate in the study or confounds the ability to interpret data from the study as determined by the study principal investigator (PI) or enrolling physician\n* Known involvement by primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma or known uncontrolled involvement by non-primary CNS non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) at the time of study entry\n* Known history (within last 12 months) of or current relevant CNS pathology, such as:\n\n  * Epilepsy, seizure, paresis, aphasia, apoplexy, severe brain injury, cerebellar disease, organic brain syndrome, psychosis, cerebrovascular stroke or\n  * Evidence for presence of inflammatory lesions and/or vasculitis on cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\n* Another active malignancy (aside from B-cell NHL) in the past 5 years, with the following exceptions: non-melanoma skin cancer that has undergone potentially curative therapy, in situ cervical carcinoma, or any other tumor that has been deemed to be effectively treated with definitive local control and with curative intent as per treating investigator\n* Evidence of any active infection (bacterial, viral, fungal, mycobacterial, parasitic, or other) at study enrollment or within 2 weeks of study enrollment, if requiring ongoing treatment and/or has the potential to cause disseminated disease or severe infection upon immunosuppression.
