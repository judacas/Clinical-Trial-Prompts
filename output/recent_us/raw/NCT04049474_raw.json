A separate baseline assessment is required if a negative screening pregnancy test was obtained more than 72 hours before the first dose of study drug.\n\n  * Females of childbearing potential (all post pubertal females will be considered to be of childbearing potential unless they have early menopause [amenorrheic for at least 12 consecutive months, in the appropriate age group, and without other known or suspected cause] or have been sterilized surgically [ie, bilateral tubal ligation, total hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy, all with surgery at least 1 month before dosing]) who:\n  * Do not agree to use a highly effective method of contraception for the entire study period and for 6 months after study drug discontinuation, ie:\n  * Total abstinence (if it is their preferred and usual lifestyle);\n  * An intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS);\n  * A contraceptive implant;\n  * An oral contraceptive (must be on a stable dose of the same oral hormonal contraceptive product for at least 4 weeks before dosing with study drug and for the duration of the study and for 6 months after study drug discontinuation); or\n  * Do not have a vasectomized partner with confirmed azoospermia.\n\nFor sites outside of the European Union (EU), it is permissible that if a highly effective method of contraception is not appropriate or acceptable to the participant, or the participant has commenced/adjusted/changed oral hormonal contraceptive product/dose within 4 weeks prior to study drug administration, then the participant must agree to use a medically acceptable method of contraception, ie, double barrier methods of contraception such as condoms plus diaphragm or cervical/vault cap with spermicide.\n\n* Males who have not had a successful vasectomy (confirmed azoospermia) or if they and their female partners do not meet the criteria above (ie, not of childbearing potential or practicing highly effective contraception throughout the study period or for 3 months after study drug discontinuation).

Confirmation of radiographic stability must be done by comparing the brain scan (CT or MRI) performed during the Screening Period, using the same imaging modality, to a brain scan performed earlier (and following local therapy where applicable). Participants must be clinically stable. It is not the intention of this protocol to treat participants with active brain metastases.\n\nNote: CNS imaging is required to confirm eligibility for participants with a known history of CNS disease.\n\n* Have had or are planning to have the following invasive procedures:\n\n  * Major surgical procedure or significant traumatic injury within 28 days prior to study drug administration\n  * Laparoscopic procedure or open biopsy within 7 days prior to study drug administration\n  * Central line placement or subcutaneous port placement is not considered major surgery but must be placed at least 2 days prior to study drug administration\n  * Core biopsy, including bone marrow biopsy, within 2 days prior to study drug administration\n  * Fine needle aspirate within 3 days prior to study drug administration\n* Has any serious concomitant illness that in the opinion of the investigator(s) could affect the participant's safety or interfere with the study assessments\n* Participants with known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); due to lack of available safety data for eribulin therapy in HIV-infected participants",
