Any residual tumor; lack of complete pathologic response.\n* Patients planning to receive adjuvant radiation to the breast and/or regional nodes.\n* Patients planning to receive capecitabine per the treating physician\n\nPatients already receiving capecitabine as adjuvant therapy are eligible to enroll in this study, provided adverse events deemed by the treating physician as possibly, probably or definitely related to adjuvant capecitabine prior to study therapy have resolved to CTCAE v.5.0 grade 1 or below (except alopecia), and provided duration of planned capecitabine includes entire duration of planned radiotherapy.\n\n* ECOG performance status 0 or 1\n* Tamoxifen: patients who have received Tamoxifen as chemoprevention are still eligible.\n\nEndocrine receptor therapies (Hormone receptor inhibitors) may not be given with study treatment.\n\n* .

    "exclusion_criteria": "* Pregnant or lactating females. Women who are pregnant or who become pregnant are excluded from this study because capecitabine is a chemotherapeutic agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with capecitabine, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with capecitabine. These potential risks may also apply to radiotherapy used in this study.\n* Serious medical or psychiatric illness that in the judgement of the treating physician places the patient at risk & would limit compliance with the study requirements.\n* Inability to swallow or retain whole pills.\n* Patients with known or suspected allergy to capecitabine or 5-FU.\n* Contraindications to capecitabine or radiotherapy as determined by the treating physician including severe renal impairment (GFR < 30).\n* Prior radiation to the ipsilateral breast.",
