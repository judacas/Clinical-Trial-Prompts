    "inclusion_criteria": "* Performance status </=2 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale\n* Life expectancy > 3 months\n* Relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Participants with primary refractory myeloma only allowed in dose-escalation phase of the study.\n* Prior treatment: Treated with at least three prior lines of multiple myeloma therapy including a proteasome inhibitor and an immuno modulatory agent or who are double refractory to a proteasome inhibitor and an immuno modulatory agent. Prior anti-CD38 antibody (e.g., daratumumab, isatuximab) treatment is acceptable only for participants receiving monotherapy treatment.\n* Prior treatment: Treated with two or more lines of prior therapy, with disease refractory to both a proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent, and disease progression (as defined by International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria) following treatment with an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody given as monotherapy or in combination therapy. The most recent treatment regimen must have contained an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody.\n* Treatment with prior autologous transplant is permitted\n* Documented diagnosis of symptomatic multiple myeloma, as defined by the IMWG\n* Measurable disease defined as at least one of the following: serum M-protein >/=1 grams/deciliter (g/dL), urine M-protein >/= 200 milligrams/24 hours (mg/24h), serum free light chain (SFLC) assay: involved SFLCs >/= 10 mg/dL (>/= 100 mg/L) and an abnormal SFLC ratio (<0.26 or >1.65).\n* Female participants of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within the 7 days prior to the first study drug administration.\n* For women of childbearing potential: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive methods that result in a failure rate of < 1% per year during the treatment period and for at least 2 months after the last dose of RO6870810 as monotherapy, or for at least 3 months after the last dose of daratumumab.\n* For men: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive measures and agreement to refrain from donating sperm, as defined: With female partners of childbearing potential or pregnant female partners, men must remain abstinent or use a condom during the treatment period and for at least 4 months after the last dose of RO6870810 as monotherapy, or for at least 3 months after the last dose of daratumumab.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Plasma cell leukemia defined as peripheral plasma cell count > 2000/cubic millimeter (mm^3)\n* For expansion cohorts only: Primary refractory multiple myeloma defined as disease that is non-responsive in participants who have never achieved a minimal response or better with any therapy\n* History of other malignancy within 2 years prior to screening, except for ductal carcinoma in situ not requiring chemotherapy, appropriately treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix, non-melanoma skin carcinoma, low-grade, localized prostate cancer (Gleason score </= 7) not requiring treatment or appropriately treated Stage I uterine cancer\n* POEMS syndrome (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal protein and skin changes)\n* Current or prior disease or treatment that could compromise protocol objectives in the opinion of the Investigator and/or the Sponsor\n* Pregnant or breastfeeding female.\n* Consumption of agents which strongly inhibit CYP3A4 enzyme, within 7 days prior to the first dose of study treatment and during the study.\n* Consumption of agents which strongly induce CYP3A4 enzyme, within 14 days prior to the first dose of study treatment and during the study.\n* Surgery within 21 days prior to study entry.\n* Prior treatment with small molecule BET family inhibitor or receiving steroids >the equivalent of 10mg prednisone daily\n* participants who are currently receiving any other investigational agent or have received an investigational agent within 30 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer, prior to study entry\n* Uncontrolled cancer pain\n* Prior anti-cancer therapy (chemotherapy, targeted agents, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy) within 14 days except for alkylating agents (e.g., melphalan) within 28 days.",
