    "inclusion_criteria": "Key Inclusion Criteria for all Individuals:\n\n* Histologically confirmed advanced or metastatic solid tumor that is measurable or nonmeasurable.\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0, 1, or 2.\n* Adequate hematologic counts without transfusional or growth factor support within 2 weeks of study drug initiation (hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1,500/mm^3, and platelets ≥ 100,000/ μL).\n* Creatinine clearance ≥ 30 mL/min as assessed by the Cockcroft-Gault equation.\n\nKey Inclusion Criteria for Individuals with Normal Hepatic Function:\n\n* Normal hepatic function (total bilirubin ≤ ULN and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 3.0× ULN).\n\nKey Inclusion Criteria for Individuals with Moderate Hepatic Function:\n\n* Moderate hepatic impairment (1.5 × ULN < total bilirubin < 3.0 × ULN and any level of AST).\n* For individuals with hepatic encephalopathy, the condition does not, in the Investigator's opinion, interfere with the individual's ability to provide an appropriate informed consent.\n\nKey Exclusion Criteria for all Individuals:\n\n* Have poor venous access.\n* Donated or lost 500mL or more of blood volume (including plasmapheresis) to plans to donate during the study.\n* Have had a prior anticancer biologic agent within 4 weeks prior to Day 1 or have had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy within 2 weeks prior to Day 1 and who have not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1) from adverse events (AEs) at the time of study entry. Individuals participating in observational studies are eligible.\n* Had prior treatment with irinotecan within 4 weeks prior to Day 1.\n* Have not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1) from AEs due to a previously administered agent.\n* Have an active second malignancy.\n* Have known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Individuals with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they have stable CNS disease for at least 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug and all neurologic symptoms have returned to baseline, have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are taking < 20 mg/day of prednisone or its equivalent. All individuals with carcinomatous meningitis are excluded regardless of clinical stability.\n* Have history of cardiac disease.\n* Have active chronic inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease) or gastrointestinal (GI) perforation within 6 months of enrollment.\n* Have active serious infection (Contact medical monitor for clarification).\n* High-dose systemic corticosteroids (≥20 mg of prednisone or its equivalent) are not allowed within 2 weeks of Check-In. However, inhaled, intranasal, intra-articular, and topical steroids are allowed.\n* Use of strong inhibitor or inducer of UGT1A1.\n* Have a known history of Gilbert's disease.\n\nKey Exclusion Criteria for Individuals with Normal Hepatic Impairment:\n\n* Must have pre-existing condition interfering with hepatic and/or renal function that could interfere with the metabolism and/or excretion of the study drug.\n\nKey Exclusion Criteria for Individuals with Moderate Hepatic Impairment:\n\n* Had a clinical exacerbation of liver disease within the 2-week period before administration of study drug (i.e., abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, or fever).\n* Had clinically demonstrable, tense ascites.\n* Had evidence of acute viral hepatitis within 1 month prior to administration of study drug.\n* Have evidence of hepatorenal syndrome.\n* Individuals with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement.\n* Have active Stage 3 or 4 encephalopathy.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
