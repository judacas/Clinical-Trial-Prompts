WOCBP are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not been free from menses for > 1 year. The two birth control methods can be composed of: two barrier methods or a barrier method plus a hormonal method to prevent pregnancy. WOCBP subjects will also be instructed to tell their male partners to use a condom.\n\nExclusion Criteria for the Study:\n\nSubjects meeting any of the following exclusion criteria will not be able to participate in this study (procurement, lymphodepletion, and cell infusion):\n\n* Subject is pregnant or lactating.\n* Tumor in a location where enlargement could cause airway obstruction.\n* Current use of systemic corticosteroids at doses ≥10mg prednisone daily or its equivalent; those receiving <10mg daily may be enrolled at the discretion of investigator. Patients with primary CNS lymphoma can receive higher doses of steroids per the investigator's discretion.\n* Active infection with HIV, HTLV, HBV, and HCV (can be pending at the time of cell procurement; only those samples confirming lack of active infection will be used to generate transduced cells) defined as not being well controlled on therapy. Subjects are required to have negative HIV antibody, negative HTLV1 and HTLV2 antibodies, negative Hepatitis B surface antigen, and negative HCV antibody or viral load. In addition, subjects with positive Hepatitis B core antibody will have Hepatitis B viral load tested and subjects with positive Hepatitis B viral load will also be excluded.\n* Subject must either have core antibody negative HBV (results can be pending at the time of cell procurement) OR if a subject is hepatitis B core antibody positive they must have their hepatitis B viral load checked. These subjects will be excluded if their viral load is positive at baseline. Subjects who are core antibody positive and viral load negative at baseline will be considered eligible.\n* A history of intolerance to fludarabine. Note: subjects with history of intolerance to bendamustine may be considered for enrollment at the discretion of the clinical investigator if they are candidates for lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine.\n\nEligibility criteria to be met prior to procurement:\n\n* Subjects must sign a consent to undergo cell procurement.\n* Life expectancy ≥ 12 weeks.\n* Evidence of adequate organ function as defined by:\n\nThe following is required within 7 days prior to procurement:\n\n* Bilirubin ≤1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). Subjects with Gilbert's syndrome may be enrolled despite a total bilirubin level >1.5 mg/dL if their conjugated bilirubin is <1.5× ULN)\n* AST ≤ 3 times ULN\n* Creatinine Clearance (CrCl) >30mL/min per Cockcroft and Gault\n* Pulse oximetry of >90% on room air\n\n  * Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥35% as measured by ECHO, with no additional evidence of decompensated heart failure.\n  * In patients with disease assessed by imaging, imaging results from within 90 days prior to procurement to assess the presence of active disease. If disease is not measurable by imaging, evidence of active disease within 90 days of procurement via bone marrow biopsy or SPEP/immunofixation.\n  * Negative serum pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to procurement or documentation that the subject is post-menopausal. Post-menopausal status must be confirmed with documentation of absence of menses for >1 year, or documentation of surgical menopause involving bilateral oophorectomy.\n\nEligibility criteria to be met prior to lymphodepletion:\n\n* Written informed consent to enroll in the CAR T-cell therapy trial must be obtained prior to lymphodepletion.\n* Imaging results from within 7 days prior to lymphodepletion. Imaging must occur at least 3 weeks after most recent therapy (used as baseline measure for documentation of progression before the lymphodepletion) to document measurable or assessable disease. Imaging does not need to be repeated if it is within 7 days prior to lymphodepletion. For WM, imaging does not need to be repeated prior to lymphodepletion if no evidence of disease at screening.\n* Evidence of adequate organ function as defined by:\n\nThe following are required within 72 hours prior to lymphodepletion:\n\n* Adequate bone marrow function (ANC ≥1.0 x 10^9/L and platelets ≥50 x 10^9/L) unless related to lymphoma involvement. Subjects cannot have received platelet transfusion within 7 days of lymphodepletion.\n* Bilirubin ≤1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). Subjects with Gilbert's syndrome may be enrolled despite a total bilirubin level >1.5 mg/dL if their conjugated bilirubin is <1.5× ULN)\n* AST ≤ 3 times ULN\n* Creatinine Clearance (CrCl) >30mL/min per Cockcroft and Gault\n* Pulse oximetry of > 90% on room air\n* Negative serum pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to lymphodepletion or documentation that the subject is post-menopausal. Post-menopausal status must be confirmed with documentation of absence of menses for > 1 year, or documentation of surgical menopause involving bilateral oophorectomy.\n* In subjects with CLL/SLL or lymphoma with bone marrow only involvement, a bone marrow biopsy within 28 days prior to lymphodepletion.\n* Subjects that have received therapy with murine antibodies must have documentation of absence of human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA) prior to lymphodepletion. Subjects who have received prior therapy with murine antibodies must have documentation of absence of HAMA within 8 weeks of lymphodepletion or after their most recent murine antibody therapy (whichever is shortest). For subjects that receive murine monoclonal antibodies or murine-human chimeric monoclonal antibodies between procurement and lymphodepletion, HAMA testing should be performed within 4 weeks prior to lymphodepletion and after the last monoclonal antibody dose.\n* Available autologous transduced activated T cells product meets the certificate of analysis.\n* Has not received any investigational agents or received any tumor vaccines within the previous six weeks prior to lymphodepletion.\n* Subject is not taking a prohibited or contraindicated medication prior to lymphodepletion. Contraindicated medications should be discontinued at least two weeks prior to the scheduled lymphodepletion or by at least 5 half-lives of the contraindicated medication, whichever is shorter.\n* Subject is not taking strong inhibitors of CYP1A2 (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin) as these may increase plasma concentrations of bendamustine, and decrease plasma concentrations of its metabolites. See http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/ for an updated list of strong inhibitors of CYP1A2. (This applies to subjects who receive bendamustine for lymphodepletion (required) up through 72 hours after the last dose of bendamustine).\n* Subject has not received chemotherapy within the previous 3 weeks prior to lymphodepletion.\n\nEligibility criteria to be met prior to cell infusion after lymphodepletion:\n\n* No evidence of uncontrolled infection or sepsis.\n* Negative serum pregnancy within 7 days of cell infusion (does not need to be repeated if pre-lymphodepletion pregnancy test is within window).\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
