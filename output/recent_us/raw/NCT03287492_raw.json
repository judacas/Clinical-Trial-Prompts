Exceptions may be considered after documented discussion with Novartis.\n\nOther inclusion criteria included in the protocol might apply.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Use of systemic chronic steroid therapy (≥10mg /day of prednisone or equivalent), or any immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days of first dose of study treatment.
