    "inclusion_criteria": "* >= 2 years and < 18 years at the time of enrollment\n* Weight must be >= 18 kg. For patients < 12 years of age and expected to receive cyclosporine, weight must be >= 30kg\n* Planned allogeneic HCT (bone marrow, peripheral blood stem cell, or cord blood transplant)\n* Patient must be CMV sero-positive (i.e., recipient CMV immunoglobulin G positive)\n* Patient is eligible for entry only if it is feasible for plasma CMV PCR testing to be sent and resulted within the protocol mandated time period\n\n  * Reminder: To limit the likelihood of positive plasma CMV PCR post-enrollment and prior to start of study treatment period, it is recommended that patient enrollment proceed after patients start their transplant preparative regimen\n* Patient must have a performance status corresponding to Lansky/Karnofsky scores > 50\n\n  * Note: Use Lansky for patients =< 16 years of age and Karnofsky for patients > 16 years of age. For further reference, see performance status scales scoring under the standard sections for protocols among protocol reference materials provided on the Children's Oncology Group (COG) member website: https://members.childrensoncologygroup.org/prot/reference_materials.asp\n* Estimated glomerular filtration rate > 15 mL/min/1.73 m^2 and not receiving dialysis\n* Total bilirubin =< 2.5 mg/dL and serum glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (SPGT) (alanine transaminase [ALT]) =<10 x upper limit of normal (ULN) for age\n\n  * Note: For the purpose of this study, the ULN for SGPT (ALT) has been set to the value of 45 U/L\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 2 Years\nMust have maximum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Expected inability to tolerate oral formulation (e.g., unable swallow whole tablets) of letermovir\n\n  * Note: Determination of ability to tolerate the oral formulation will be based on a self-assessment or caregiver assessment; eligible subjects and their caregiver will be shown a life size picture of a tablet (or actual tablet) and confirm ability to swallow whole tablet in order to meet study eligibility\n* Hypersensitivity to letermovir or any component of the formulation\n* History of CMV end organ disease within 6 months (180 days) prior to enrollment\n\n  * Note: CMV end organ disease based on proposed definitions by Ljungman et al. and inclusive of proven, probable or possible disease\n* Receipt of prior allogeneic HCT within one year of study enrollment\n* Planned prophylactic administration of other anti-CMV medications or cellular products during the study, including:\n\n  * High dose acyclovir (defined as doses >= 1500 mg/m^2 IV or >= 3200 mg oral (patients >= 40 kg) or >= 2400 mg/m^2 (patients < 40 kg) per day)\n  * High dose valacyclovir (defined as doses >= 3000 mg/day in patients > 20 kg)\n  * Foscarnet\n  * Ganciclovir\n  * Valganciclovir\n  * CMV-directed cytotoxic T lymphocytes\n* Planned receipt of the following contraindicated medications during the study treatment period; contraindicated medications must be discontinued at least 14 days prior to Day +1\n\n  * Contraindicated medications for all patients:\n\n    * Pimozide\n    * Ergot alkaloids\n  * Contraindicated medications for patients planned to receive cyclosporine:\n\n    * Bosentan\n    * Lovastatin\n    * Pitavastatin\n    * Rosuvastatin\n    * Simvastatin\n* Female patients who are pregnant since fetal toxicities and teratogenic effects have been noted in certain animal reproduction studies with letermovir. A pregnancy test is required for female patients of childbearing potential\n* Lactating females who plan to breastfeed their infants\n* Sexually active female patients of reproductive potential who have not agreed to use an effective contraceptive method for the duration of their letermovir treatment and through at least 4 weeks after the last dose of letermovir.\n\n  * Note: No contraception measures are needed specifically during letermovir treatment for male trial participants who have pregnant or non-pregnant female partner(s) of reproductive potential. Contraception measures may be required for other aspects of the HCT procedure.\n* All patients and/or their parents or legal guardians must sign a written informed consent\n* All institutional, Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and National Cancer Institute (NCI) requirements for human studies must be met",
