The need to exclude patients with AIDS from this protocol is necessary because the treatments involved in this protocol may be significantly immunosuppressive and worsen the patient's HIV symptoms.\n  * Active connective tissue disorders, such as lupus or scleroderma, which in the opinion of the treating physician may put the patient at high risk for immunologic toxicity.\n  * History of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids, evidence of interstitial lung disease or active, non-infectious pneumonitis\n  * Patients with active autoimmune disease or history of autoimmune disease that might recur, which may affect vital organ function or require immune suppressive treatment including systemic corticosteroids, should be excluded. These include but are not limited to patients with a history of immune related neurologic disease, multiple sclerosis, autoimmune (demyelinating) neuropathy, Guillain-Barre syndrome or Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy, myasthenia gravis; systemic autoimmune disease such as Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, connective tissue diseases, scleroderma, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's, ulcerative colitis, hepatitis; and patients with a history of toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome, or phospholipid syndrome should be excluded because of the risk of recurrence or exacerbation of disease.\n  * Of note, patients with vitiligo, endocrine deficiencies including thyroiditis managed with replacement hormones including physiologic corticosteroids are eligible. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis and other arthropathies, Sjögren's syndrome and psoriasis controlled with topical medication and patients with positive serology, such as antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-thyroid antibodies should be evaluated for the presence of target organ involvement and potential need for systemic treatment but should otherwise be eligible.\n  * Any other major medical illnesses or psychiatric impairments that in the investigator's opinion will prevent administration or completion of protocol therapy.\n  * Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment. Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical cancer.\n  * Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least four weeks prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using steroids for at least 7 days prior to trial treatment. This exception does not include carcinomatous meningitis which is excluded regardless of clinical stability.\n  * Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (eg, thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment.\n  * Has known history of, or any evidence of active, non-infectious pneumonitis.\n  * Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy?\n  * Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.\n  * Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial\n  * Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.\n  * Has received prior therapy with an anti-Programmed Death 1 (PD-1), anti- Programmed Death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), or anti- Programmed Death-ligand 1 (PD-L2) agent.\n  * Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV ½ antibodies).\n  * Has known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HbsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (eg, HCV RNA [qualitative] is detected).\n  * Has received a live attenuated vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy.\n\n    * Note: Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and are allowed; however Intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.\n* Patient must have < 1.0 cm midline shift pre-operative\n* History of severe hypersensitivity reaction to any monoclonal antibody including pembrolizumab.\n* Patients who cannot safely undergo MRI due to non-MRI compatible pacemaker, or other reason.\n* Patients who have tumors for which the Gd-enhancing mass appears to be covered ≤ 90% using 2 catheters and assuming a 3.0 cm diameter based on pre-operative planning are unlikely to have adequate LITT and thus ineligible for the study.",
