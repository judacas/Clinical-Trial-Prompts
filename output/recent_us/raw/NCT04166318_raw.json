Lists including medications and substances known or with the potential to interact with the specified CYP3A4 isoenzymes.\n* Participants with evidence of ongoing hemorrhage, active signs/symptoms of bleeding, or history of severe bleeding complications in the one year prior to enrollment.\n* Any history of CTCAE grade >= 2 symptomatic non-dysrhythmia cardiac conditions or cardiac dysrhythmia within the last 6 months.\n* History of thrombosis, troponin-positive (Tpos) or myocardial infarction within the last 6 months\n* Participants with moderate (Child-Pugh Score B) or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Score C)\n* Diagnosis of primary effusion lymphoma [PEL] or another lymphoma.\n* Participants with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment that has potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the regimen.\n* Pregnant individuals as evaluated by a positive serum or urine beta-hCG at screening.\n* There is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the nursing person with pacritinib. Breastfeeding should be discontinued if the nursing person is treated with pacritinib.\n* Participants with the following cardiac conditions at screening:\n\n  * symptomatic congestive heart failure\n  * unstable angina pectoris\n  * uncontrolled cardiac dysrhythmias\n  * QTc(Fredericia) prolongation >480 ms or other factors that increase the risk for QT prolongation (i.e., heart failure, or a history of long QT interval syndrome).\n* Uncontrolled bacterial, mycobacterial, or fungal infection at screening.\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness that would limit compliance with study requirements, including results of hematology and chemistry testing, infection disease (etc.)\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 120 Years",
