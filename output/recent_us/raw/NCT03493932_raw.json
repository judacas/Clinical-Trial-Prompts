Non-childbearing potential for a person assigned as female at birth is defined as 1 of the following:\n\n≥ 45 years of age and has not had menses for >1 year\n\nAmenorrheic for > 2 years without a hysterectomy and/or oophorectomy and follicle-stimulating hormone value in the postmenopausal range upon pretrial (screening) evaluation\n\nStatus is post-hysterectomy, -oophorectomy, or -tubal ligation\n\nPersons of childbearing potential must be willing to use highly effective contraceptive measures during sexual contact with a person assigned as male at birth starting with the Screening visit through 90 days after last dose of trial treatment.\n\nNote: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the established and preferred contraception for the participant.\n\nPersons assigned as male at birth with a partner(s) of childbearing potential must agree to use highly effective contraceptive measures throughout the trial starting with the Screening visit through 90 days after the last dose of trial treatment is received. Persons assigned as male at birth with pregnant partners must agree to use a condom; no additional method of contraception is required for the pregnant partner.\n\nNote: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the established and preferred contraception method for the participant.\n\nKnown history or current symptoms of cardiac disease, or history of treatment with cardiotoxic agents, should have a clinical risk assessment of cardiac function using New York Heart Association Functional Classification. To be eligible for this trial, patients should be Class 2 or lower. Class 2 is defined as slight limitation of physical activity, in which ordinary physical activity leads to fatigue, palpitation, or dyspnea; the person is comfortable at rest.\n\nPatients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessments of the investigational arms are eligible for this trial.\n\nPatients with known HIV infection who are on effective anti-retroviral therapy with undetectable viral load within 6 months are eligible for this trial.\n\nPatients with evidence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection must have an undetectable HBV viral load on suppressive therapy, if indicated.\n\nPatients with a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection must have been treated and cured. For patients with known HCV infection who are currently on treatment, they are eligible if they have an undetectable HCV viral load.\n\nWilling and able to comply with the requirements of the protocol.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 99 Years",
