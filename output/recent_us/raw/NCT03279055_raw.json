Patient with any histologically or cytologically confirmed solid tumor that is locally advanced or metastatic or unresectable tumor and has disease progression after treatment with available therapies that are known to confer clinical benefit or who are intolerant to treatment.\n\n   Note: Tumor types of primary interest in Part 1 Dose Escalation include tumors which are relapsed or refractory after anti PD-1/PD-L1 therapy (include but not limited to malignant melanoma, HNSCC, renal cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, Merkel cell carcinoma, urothelial, non-small cell lung cancer, gastric carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma, endometrial, TNBC, cervical cancer, and colorectal carcinoma)\n3. Disease characteristics and prior treatments for patients in Part 2:\n\n   1. Cohort A (Melanoma): Patients with advanced or metastatic melanoma who have progressed following treatment with an anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibody. Patients with BRAF mutated melanoma must have previously received BRAF/MEK targeted therapy.\n   2. Cohort B (Head and Neck): Patient has anti-PD-1/PD-L1 refractory metastatic or recurrent HNSCC of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx.

Women of childbearing potential include any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or is not postmenopausal. Postmenopausal is defined as: (1) Amenorrhea ≥12 consecutive months without another cause and a documented serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level >35 mIU/mL; (2) Women with irregular menstrual periods and a documented serum FSH level >35 mIU/mL; or (3) Women on hormone replacement therapy (HRT)\n10. All patients, male and female, who are not surgically sterilized or postmenopausal as defined above, must agree to use dual effective birth control during the study and for at least 28 days after the last dose of study medication and 5 months after the last dose of atezolizumab.\n\n    Highly effective methods of contraception are hormonal contraceptives (oral, injectable, patch, intrauterine devices), male partner sterilization, or total abstinence from heterosexual intercourse, when this is the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Note: The double-barrier method (eg, synthetic condoms, diaphragm, or cervical cap with spermicidal foam, cream, or gel), periodic abstinence (such as calendar, symptothermal, post-ovulation), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), lactational amenorrhea method, and spermicide only are not acceptable as highly effective methods of contraception\n11. Patients has adequate hematologic and organ function, defined as:\n\n    1. ANC ≥1500 mm3 without requiring G-CSF\n    2. Platelets ≥100,000/mm3\n    3. Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL Note: Patients with Hb 7 to ≤9 g/dL (without bleeding) transfused prior to dosing in order to meet eligibility criteria\n    4. Serum creatinine ≤1.5× upper limit of normal (ULN) for the reference laboratory or creatinine clearance ≥50 mL/min within the 28 days before enrollment (calculated from Cockcroft-Gault formula or 24 hour urine collection).\n    5. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST) ≤3.0× the upper limit of normal (ULN) if no liver involvement or ≤5×ULN with liver involvement\n    6. Adequate coagulation: prothrombin time (PT), an International Normalized Ratio (INR) or activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) ≤1.5×ULN or for patients requiring anticoagulant therapy, the PT/INR, aPTT should be within therapeutic range of the given anticoagulant agent\n    7. Total bilirubin ≤1.5×ULN (or total serum bilirubin ≤3×ULN for patients with Gilbert's disease)\n12. Patients must be willing and able to provide written informed consent prior to the performance of any study-specific procedure\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
