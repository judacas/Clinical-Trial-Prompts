Men must refrain from donating sperm during this this same period.\n  * With a pregnant female partner, men must remain abstinent or use a condom during the treatment period and for 6 months after the final dose of bevacizumab and 90 days after the final dose of tiragolumab to avoid potential exposure to the embryo.\n  * The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not adequate methods of contraception.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
