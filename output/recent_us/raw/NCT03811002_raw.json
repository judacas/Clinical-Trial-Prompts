Participants receiving ART that are strong CYP3A4 inducers are not eligible to be included in the study.\n* Participants who are hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive are eligible if they have received hepatitis B virus (HBV) antiviral therapy for at least 4 weeks and have undetectable HBV viral load prior to randomization.\n\nNote: Participants should remain on anti-viral therapy throughout study intervention and follow local guidelines for HBV anti-viral therapy post completion of study intervention. Hepatitis B screening tests, including HBsAg and hepatitis B core antibodies (anti-HBc), are required for all participants.\n\n* Participants with history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are eligible if HCV viral load is undetectable at screening (Participants must have completed curative anti-viral therapy at least 4 weeks prior to the first administration of the study treatment).\n* A person of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required.\n* Participants of child-bearing potential must agree to use 2 methods of birth control or be surgically sterile or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course of the study through 6 months after the last dose of study medication. Should a person of child-bearing potential become pregnant or suspect they are pregnant while they or their partner is participating in this study, they should inform their treating physician immediately.\n* Participant must understand the investigational nature of this study and sign an Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board approved written informed consent form prior to receiving any study related procedure.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PDL2 agent or with an agent directed to another stimulatory or co-inhibitory T-cell receptor (e.g., CTLA-4, OX40, CD137).\n* Has received prior systemic anti-cancer therapy within 5 half-lives of last dose (or within 30 days for cellular therapy or investigational agents, or within 100 days post allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and without any grade ≥ 2 graft versus host disease) prior to enrollment.\n* Has received prior radiotherapy within 2 weeks of start of study intervention or radiation related toxicities requiring corticosteroids.
