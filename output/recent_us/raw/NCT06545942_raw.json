    "official_title": "A Multi-centre, Randomised, Placebo-controlled, Double-blind, Parallel-group Trial to Evaluate Safety and Efficacy of Spesolimab (BI 655130) in Adult Patients With Ulcerative Pyoderma Gangrenosum (PG) Who Require Systemic Therapy",
    "inclusion_criteria": "Inclusion criteria:\n\n1. Adult trial participants, aged ≥18 years (if local legislation for age of consent differs, then local legislation will be followed) at screening.\n2. Signed and dated written informed consent in accordance with International Council on Harmonisation-Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP) and local legislation prior to admission to the trial.\n3. A confirmed diagnosis of ulcerative pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) (≥10 points on the PARACELSUS score) that requires systemic therapy in the opinion of the investigator. The diagnosis needs to be confirmed by an Adjudication Committee. Trial participants with mixed PG subtypes are eligible as long as the target lesion is of the ulcerative subtype.\n4. At least one measurable (defined as measuring ≥5 cm^2) PG ulcer. In trial participants with more than one PG ulcer, the target PG ulcer will be selected by the investigator and confirmed by external Adjudication Committee.\n5. At the time of the Screening Visit, a maximum duration of 6 months since the target ulcer in the current PG episode was diagnosed. Target ulcers >6 months since diagnosis are allowed if they are active and progressing, as judged by the investigator and confirmed by an Adjudication Committee.\n6. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must be ready and able to use highly effective methods of birth control per ICH M3 (R2) that result in a low failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly. A list of contraception methods meeting these criteria and instructions on the duration of use is provided in the participant information and in the protocol.\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\n1. Trial participants with non-PG lesions.\n2. Trial participants with a target PG ulcer measuring >80 cm^2.\n3. Trial participants with chronic, non-inflamed PG wounds or ulcers that are not responsive to immunosuppressive therapy, as determined by an Adjudication Committee.\n4. Presence of active ulcer infection at the Screening Visit (unless treated and resolved prior to administration of the first dose of trial medication) based on investigator assessment.\n5. Presence of persistent or recurring bacterial infection requiring systemic antibiotic therapy; or clinically significant viral, fungal, or parasitic infections within 2 weeks prior to the Screening Visit. Any such infection must be resolved, with treatment completed ≥2 weeks prior to the Screening Visit. No new/recurrent infections should have occurred prior to Visit 2.\n6. \"Active or latent tuberculosis (TB)\n\n   * Participants with active TB are excluded\n   * Participants with latent TB may be included if treatment of latent TB, as per local guidelines, is initiated prior to randomization and completed during the course of the trial.\"\n7. Chronic or acute infections including Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections and viral hepatitis (including occult hepatitis); the corresponding laboratory tests will be performed during screening. A trial participant can be re-screened if the trial participant was treated and is cured from the acute infection.\n8. Severe, progressive, or uncontrolled hepatic disease, defined as >3x Upper Limit of Normal (ULN) elevation in Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or alkaline phosphatase, or >2x ULN elevation in total bilirubin.\n\nFurther exclusion criteria apply.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
