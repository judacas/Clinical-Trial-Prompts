    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Subjects must be at least 22 years of age.\n2. Subjects must have the ability to provide written informed consent.\n3. Subjects must have tumor(s) invading bone and requiring surgical excision including but not limited to craniomaxillofacial, spine, long bone, and pelvis.\n4. Subjects must be willing to have quality cross-sectional imaging that will allow for use to develop a 3D printed model.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 22 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Pregnant or nursing women.\n2. Subjects that have a serious systemic pathology.\n3. Subjects that have clotting disorders.\n4. Subjects that have uncontrolled hypertension.\n5. Subjects that are HIV-positive.\n6. Subjects that are unable to be randomized; i.e surgical team prefers to use either 3D model or standard cross-sectional imaging for surgical pre-planning.\n7. Subject anatomy has changed substantially since the date medical imaging from which the model is derived was obtained (as applicable).\n8. Subject is a poor surgical or poor study candidate which may include, any medical, social or psychological problem that could complicate the procedure.",
