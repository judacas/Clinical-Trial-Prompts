    "exclusion_criteria": "* Any of the following because this study involves an agent that has known genotoxic, mutagenic and teratogenic effects:\n\n  * Pregnant persons.\n  * Nursing persons.\n  * Persons of childbearing potential and with partners of childbearing potential who are unwilling to employ adequate contraception.\n* CTCAE >= grade 3 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) to prior checkpoint inhibitor, TEAE requiring systemic corticosteroids, or permanent treatment discontinuation due to toxicity.\n* Neuromuscular disorders (e.g. inflammatory myopathies, muscular dystrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and spinal muscular atrophy), or a history of rhabdomyolysis.\n* Concomitant treatment with drugs that are recognized to cause rhabdomyolysis, including statins.\n\n  * NOTE: Patients taking such medications need to be discontinued at least 2 weeks prior to starting sonidegib treatment.
