    "official_title": "A Randomized Prospective Trial of Adjuvant Chemotherapy in Patients With Completely Resected Stage I or IIA Non-Squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Identified as Intermediate or High Risk by a 14-Gene Prognostic Assay",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Written informed consent\n* Age ≥ 18 years\n* Able to comply with the protocol, including acceptable candidacy for adjuvant chemotherapy according to local institutional standards and likely compliance with follow-up for anticipated length of study (i.e. 5 years from the initiation of enrollment).\n* Willing to be randomized to chemotherapy.\n* Histologically documented completely resected (R0) Stage I or IIA non-squamous NSCLC (per 8th edition, TNM staging system)\n* Adequate tissue sample for the 14-Gene Prognostic Assay\n* Life expectancy excluding NSCLC diagnosis ≥ 5 years\n* ECOG performance status 0-1\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Final pathologic diagnosis of pure squamous cell, pure small cell, or pure neuroendocrine histology, or any combination of only these three histologies\n* Evidence of greater than stage IIA pathologic staging\n* Evidence of incomplete resection\n* Pregnant or lactating women\n* Unwilling to use an effective means of contraception\n* Active infection, either systemic or at site of primary resection\n* Systemic chemotherapy or anti-cancer agent within 5 years prior to enrollment\n* Radiotherapy to the chest in the immediate pre- or post- operative period\n* Malignancies other than the current NSCLC within 5 years prior to randomization, except for adequately treated CIS of the cervix, non-melanoma skin cancer, localized prostate cancer treated locally, ductal carcinoma in situ treated surgically\n* Treatment with any investigational drug or participation in another clinical trial within 28 days prior to enrollment\n* Known hypersensitivity to study treatment agents\n* Evidence of any other disease including infection that contraindicates the use of systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy or puts the patient at high risk for treatment-related complications\n* Wound dehiscence or infection",
