    "official_title": "Phase I Study of Th-1 Dendritic Cell Immunotherapy in Combination with Standard Chemotherapy for the Adjuvant Treatment of Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma (DECIST)",
    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Provision of signed and dated informed consent form for Step 1\n2. Male or female, aged 18 years and older\n3. Diagnosed with adenocarcinoma or adenosquamous carcinoma of the pancreas deemed to be potentially resectable and who are deemed to be good candidates for adjuvant and/or neoadjuvant chemotherapy. This may include patients whose tumors are deemed suitable for upfront resection as well as patients whose tumors are deemed borderline resectable and thus undergo neoadjuvant therapy prior to resection. Note: Women of child-bearing potential must be on birth control for 30 days prior to first vaccination; it is recommended to discuss this requirement with subjects at Step 1.\n\nStep 1\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Unresectable or metastatic (stage IV) pancreatic cancer.\n2. Patients with known HIV and a positive viral load.\n3. Patients with active HBV and HCV infection. Those who are Hepatitis B sAb positive as well as those who are Hepatitis C Ab positive, but Hepatitis C RNA viral load negative will not be excluded.\n4. Patients with any active autoimmune disease or immune deficiency or previous Guillain-Barre syndrome. Patients with eczema, psoriasis, lichen simplex chronicus, or vitiligo with dermatologic manifestations only (e.g. patient with psoriatic arthritis are excluded) are eligible provided all of the following conditions are met:\n\n   1. Rash that covers &gt; 10 % of body surface area.\n   2. Disease is well controlled at baseline and requires only low-potency topical corticosteroids.\n   3. No occurrence of acute exacerbations of the underlying condition requiring psoralen plus ultraviolet A radiation, methotrexate, retinoids, biologic agents, oral calcineurin inhibitors, or high-potency or oral corticosteroids within the previous 12 months.\n\nStep 2 Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Provision of signed and dated informed consent form for Step 2\n2. Must have completed standard neo-adjuvant and/or adjuvant chemotherapy and surgery, as deemed by a clinical study investigator.\n3. Must have completed standard care within 3 months of step 2 registration.\n4. Must have adequate tissue obtained from surgery, as determined and confirmed by Sponsor\n5. Adequate kidney, liver, bone marrow function, and immune function, as follows, within 28 days prior to Step 2 registration:\n\n   1. Hemoglobin ≥ 8.0 gm/dL\n   2. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,500 cells/mm3\n   3. Platelet count ≥ 75,000 /mm3\n   4. Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN),\n   5. Aspartate transaminase AST (SGOT) and alanine aminotransferase ALT (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 times the ULN\n   6. TSH range between 0.4 - 4.0 mIU / L\n   7. RF ≤ 15 IU/mL\n6. Negative Hepatitis B and C serology. Positive HBs Ab indicating immunity is not exclusionary. Those who are Hepatitis B sAb positive as well as those who are Hepatitis C Ab positive, but Hepatitis C RNA viral load negative will not be excluded.\n7. ECOG performance status ≤ 2.\n8. For women of childbearing potential (WOCBP): At the time of (or prior to) registration to Step 2, use of highly effective contraception must be discussed with participants. NOTE: Patient must agree to start contraception at least 30 days before first vaccination and continue for at least 12 weeks after her last vaccination.\n9. WOCBP must have a negative serum pregnancy within 28 days of registration to Step 2.\n10. For males of reproductive potential: use of condoms or other methods to ensure effective contraception with partner during study participation and for an additional 12 weeks following discontinuations of last vaccination.\n11. Patient must agree to not donate blood for up to 90 days after last vaccination.\n\nStep 2 Exclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Use of nonstandard adjuvant chemotherapy regimen, as determined by the Investigator.\n2. Female patients who are pregnant, breast feeding, or of childbearing potential without a negative pregnancy test within 28 days of registration to Step 2 (or decline contraception requirements as outlined above). Post-menopausal women must be amenorrheic for at least 12 months to be considered of non-childbearing potential.\n3. Patients unwilling or unable to comply with the protocol or provide informed consent.\n4. Any severe or uncontrolled medical condition or other condition that could affect participation in this study (in the opinion of the investigator), including but not limited to hyper/hypothyroidism, active systemic autoimmune disorders, untreated viral hepatitis or autoimmune hepatitis.\n5. Treatment with a systemic steroid or with any systemic immunosuppressive agent within 7 days of Step 2 registration.",
