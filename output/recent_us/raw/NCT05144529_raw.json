    "official_title": "A Phase II Trial Evaluating Feasibility and Quality of Life of Second Look Laparoscopy With HIPEC in Patients With Ovarian, Fallopian Tube or Primary Peritoneal Carcinoma",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Patients must have histologically I-III epithelial carcinoma of the ovary, fallopian tube or peritoneum or Stage IVA disease in which is there complete resolution of disease (pleural effusion) with chemotherapy\n* Patients must have undergone cytoreductive surgery and 3-8 cycles of platinum-based systemic chemotherapy prior to the second look surgery. Systemic platinum based chemotherapy must be completed less than 18 weeks prior to second look surgery.\n* Cytoreductive surgery must result in an R-0, R-1 resection prior to systemic chemotherapy\n* The intraoperative peritoneal adhesion index should be < 10.\n* Patients must be without clinical evidence of disease including a negative exam, imaging (CT or PET/CT) and normal tumor markers (CA125) after completion of systemic chemotherapy.\n* Age ≥ 18 years.\n* ECOG performance status ≤ 2.\n* Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined below (within 30 days of registration): absolute neutrophil count >1,500/mcL; platelets >100,000/mcL; total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dL; creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mg/dL; AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤ 3X; institutional upper limit of normal; alkaline phosphatase 3X institutional upper limit of normal\n* Adequate contraception and negative pregnancy test if pregnancy possible.\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign an IRB-approved informed consent document.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be FEMALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
