Head and Neck Cancer\n\n      * Prior treatment requirement in the metastatic or unresectable locally advanced setting include:\n      * Subjects must have received a platinum containing chemotherapy regimen for treatment of primary tumor in locally advanced, or metastatic settings\n      * Subjects must have received an anti-PD-1/ PD-L1 as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy.\n8. Progressed following therapy with at least one PD-1 or PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor (regardless of PD-L1 expression status), except for patients with pancreatic cancer.\n\n   a) Prior progression on a PD-1 or PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor should be unequivocal; progression that occurs within the first 8 weeks of treatment on these agents should be confirmed with a second CT at least 4 weeks apart (to exclude pseudo-progression).\n9. Patients with activating EGFR mutation or ALK rearrangement which is expected to be responsive to available tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy, must have been previously treated with an applicable tyrosine kinase inhibitor.\n10. Tumor lesion which is deemed feasible for biopsy and injection under CT or ultrasound guidance (based on size, location, and visibility) by an interventional radiologist, and patient willing and able to provide tissue from biopsy of this lesion. Injected tumor should be > 1 cm3 in volume and should not encase or be inseparable from vital structures such as major nerves or blood vessels.\n\n    a) For Part 1 monotherapy patients treated at the first dose level, the tumor for injection must be an accessible cutaneous, subcutaneous, or superficial lymph node lesion that is palpable.\n11. Measurable disease, as defined per RECIST version 1.1.\n12. Prior history of brain metastases are eligible, provided:\n\n    1. Brain metastases have been treated\n    2. Asymptomatic from the brain metastases\n    3. Corticosteroids prescribed for the management of brain metastases have been discontinued at least 7 days before registration to study\n    4. Brain metastases are stable on pre-registration imaging\n    5. No evidence of leptomeningeal disease\n13. Life expectancy > 3 months.\n14. Adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:\n\n    1. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1.5 x 10^9/L\n    2. Hemoglobin ≥90 g/L (or ≥9 g/dL)\n    3. Platelets ≥100 x 10^9/L\n    4. Calculated creatinine clearance of >50 mL/min using Cockcroft Gault equation\n    5. Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal\n    6. AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) ≤2.5 x institutional upper limit of normal\n    7. If Alkaline Phosphatase ≥ 2.5 x institutional upper limit of normal, then AST and ALT must be ≤ 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal\n15. Patients of childbearing age must not be pregnant and must use established contraceptive strategies:\n\n    1. Female subjects of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required.\n    2. Female subjects of childbearing potential should be willing to use 2 methods of birth control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course of the study through 120 days after the last dose of study medication. Subjects of childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not been free from menses for > 1 year.\n    3. Male subjects should agree to use an adequate method of barrier contraception starting with the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
