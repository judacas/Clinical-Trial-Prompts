    "exclusion_criteria": "* Diagnosis of small cell lung cancer or, for mixed tumors, presence of small cell elements.\n* Has Grade ≥2 peripheral neuropathy.\n* History of documented severe dry eye syndrome, severe Meibomian gland disease and/or blepharitis, or corneal disease that prevents/delays corneal healing.\n* Has active inflammatory bowel disease requiring immunosuppressive medication or previous clear history of inflammatory bowel disease (eg, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, or chronic diarrhea).\n* Has uncontrolled, significant cardiovascular disease or cerebrovascular disease within the 6 months preceding study intervention.\n* Received prior systemic anticancer therapy for their metastatic NSCLC.\n* Received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent, or with an agent directed to another stimulatory or coinhibitory T-cell receptor Note: Prior treatment with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD- L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting for nonmetastatic resectable NSCLC is allowed as long as therapy was completed at least 12 months before diagnosis of metastatic NSCLC.\n* Received prior systemic anticancer therapy including investigational agents within 4 weeks before randomization.\n* Received radiation therapy to the lung that is >30 Gy within 6 months of start of study intervention.\n* Received prior radiotherapy within 2 weeks of start of study intervention, or radiation-related toxicities, requiring corticosteroids.\n* Received a live or live-attenuated vaccine within 30 days before the first dose of study intervention. Administration of killed vaccines are allowed.\n* Diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy\n* Known additional malignancy that is progressing or has required active treatment within the past 3 years.\n* Known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis.\n* Known intolerance to sacituzumab tirumotecan or pembrolizumab and/or any of their excipients; for pembrolizumab, severe hypersensitivity (≥Grade 3) is exclusionary.\n* Known hypersensitivity to sacituzumab tirumotecan or other biologic therapy.\n* Active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years.\n* History of (noninfectious) pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease (ILD) that required steroids or has current pneumonitis/ILD.\n* Active infection requiring systemic therapy\n* Concurrent active Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C virus infection.\n* Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected participants with a history of Kaposi's sarcoma and/or Multicentric Castleman's Disease.\n* History of allogeneic tissue/solid organ transplant.\n* Requires treatment with a strong inhibitor or inducer of Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) at least 14 days before the first dose of study intervention and throughout the study.",
