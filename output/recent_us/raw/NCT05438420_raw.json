NOTE: Women of reproductive potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test performed within 48 hours before starting conditioning chemotherapy. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because axicabtagene ciloleucel has not been studied in pregnant women. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with axicabtagene ciloleucel, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study\n* Use of the following:\n\n  * Therapeutic doses of corticosteroids (defined as > 20 mg/day prednisone or equivalent) within 7 days before leukapheresis or 72 hours before axicabtagene ciloleucel administration.

These patients should have assessment by a total spine and brain gadolinium enhanced MRI within 5 days before axi-cel infusion to document the extent of CNS disease prior to axi-cel infusion. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling for cell count, cytology and cell markers by flow cytometry should also be included within 5 days of axi-cel infusion if previously positive\n* Inhaled or topical steroids and adrenal replacement doses =< 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease.

A brief course of corticosteroids for prophylaxis (e.g., contrast dye allergy) or for treatment of non-autoimmune conditions (e.g., delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction caused by contact allergen) is permitted. Use of anabolic steroids is permitted\n* The participant has not recovered to baseline or CTCAE =< grade 1 from toxicity due to all prior therapies except =< grade 2 alopecia, neuropathy, and other non-clinically significant adverse events (AEs), provided that all other eligibility criteria are met\n* Opportunistic infection within the last 3 months, with the exception of oropharyngeal candidiasis\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to axicabtagene ciloleucel or other agents used in study\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, or psychiatric illness with potential to limit compliance with study requirements",
