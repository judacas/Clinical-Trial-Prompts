    "exclusion_criteria": "* Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or has required active treatment within the past 3 years.

Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster (chicken pox), yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed\n* Is currently receiving either strong (e.g., itraconazole, telithromycin, clarithromycin, protease inhibitors boosted with ritonavir or cobicistat, indinavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, boceprevir, telaprevir) or moderate (e.g., ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, diltiazem, fluconazole, verapamil) inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) that cannot be discontinued for the duration of the study\n* Is currently receiving either strong (phenobarbital, enzalutamide, phenytoin, rifampicin, rifabutin, rifapentine, carbamazepine, nevirapine and St John's Wort) or moderate (e.g., bosentan, efavirenz, modafinil) inducers of CYP3A4 that cannot be discontinued for the duration of the study\n* Is currently participating in a study of an investigational agent or is currently using an investigational device\n* Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy\n* Has active bacillus tuberculosis (TB)\n* Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy (dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to randomization\n* Has a known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.
