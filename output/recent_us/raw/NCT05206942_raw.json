If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required\n  * Patients must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Diagnosis of nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma\n* Patients who have had prior systemic chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, or other systemic therapy (including investigational agents) for the treatment of cHL.\n\nNOTE: If patient received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting therapy. No radiation therapy for Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) will be allowed prior to and while participation on this clinical trial, including for system control\n\n* Patients who are actively participating in a clinical trial with an investigational agent or device or has participated in a clinical trial with an investigational agent or device within 30 days of the anticipated treatment start date.\n\nNOTE: Patients who have entered the follow-up phase of an investigational study will be eligible to participate as long as ≥ 30 days has elapsed since the administration of the last dose of an investigational treatment for a disease/condition other than cHL\n\n* Patients who have known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or lymphomatous meningitis are not eligible\n* Patients who have a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to pembrolizumab, and/or any of its excipients\n* Patients who have any contraindication to the use of any of the chemotherapeutic agents used in this study\n* Patients who have had an allogenic tissue or solid organ transplant\n* Patients who are pregnant or nursing NOTE: Pregnant persons are excluded from this study because the chemotherapy regimen (AVD) includes adriamycin (also known as doxorubicin), which is an anthracycline; anthracyclines are known chemotherapy agents with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. In addition, the investigational agent, pembrolizumab, has the potential for embryo-fetal toxicity. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with adriamycin (doxorubicin) as part of the AVD chemotherapy regimen, and the investigational agent, pembrolizumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with AVD and/or pembrolizumab.\n* Patients who have a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or are receiving systemic steroid therapy or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to registration are not eligible.
