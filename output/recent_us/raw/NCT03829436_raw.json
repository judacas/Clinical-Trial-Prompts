fertility and developmental studies with MLN0128 (TAK-228) have not been conducted; on the basis of potential hazard of other mTOR inhibitors (i.e., rapamycin and other rapalogs) on the developing fetus, women of childbearing age should avoid becoming pregnant while taking any mTOR inhibitor including MLN0128 (TAK-228)\n\n  * Female patients must:\n\n    * Be postmenopausal for at least 1 year before the screening visit, OR\n    * Be surgically sterile, OR\n    * If they are of childbearing potential, agree to practice 1 highly effective method of contraception and 1 additional effective (barrier) method, at the same time, from the time of signing the informed consent through 90 days (or longer, as mandated by local labeling [e.g., United States product insert [USPI], summary of product characteristics [SmPC], etc.;]) after the last dose of study drug, OR\n    * Agree to practice true abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient; NOTE: periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods], withdrawal, spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea are not acceptable methods of contraception; female and male condoms should not be used together\n  * Male patients, even if surgically sterilized (i.e., status postvasectomy), must:\n\n    * Agree to practice highly effective barrier contraception during the entire study treatment period and through 120 days after the last dose of study drug, OR\n    * Agree to practice true abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient (NOTE: periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods for the female partner], withdrawal, spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea are not acceptable methods of contraception; female and male condoms should not be used together)\n    * AND agree not to donate sperm during the course of this study or within 120 days after receiving their last dose of study drug\n* Ability to swallow oral medications\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",

breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with MLN0128 (TAK-228)\n* Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with MLN0128 (TAK-228);
