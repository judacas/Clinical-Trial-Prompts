Serum creatinine <= 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) or creatinine clearance >= 50 milliliters per minute (mL/min) (as calculated using the Cockcroft Gault equation or measured using 24-hour urine creatinine clearance) for participants with creatinine levels > 1.5 times institutional ULN.\n  5. Total bilirubin <= 1.5 times ULN except in participants with Gilbert's syndrome. Participants with Gilbert's syndrome may enroll if direct bilirubin <= 1.5 times ULN of the direct bilirubin.\n  6. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) <= 2.5 times ULN unless liver metastases are present, in which case they must be <= 5 times ULN.\n* Participant must have recovered to Grade 1 toxicity from prior cancer therapy (a participant with Grade 2 neuropathy or Grade 2 alopecia is an exception to this criterion and may qualify for this study).\n* Participant agrees to submit formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue specimen, which may have been collected at any time prior to screening. If no archival FFPE tumor tissue is available, participant agrees to undergo a tumor tissue biopsy before Cycle 1/Day 1. (For Cohort 3 only: if diagnosis was made by cytology and archival tissue is not available, participant will not need to provide tumor tissue).\n* Participants is able to take oral medications.\n* Female participant meets the following criteria:\n\n  a) Female participant (of childbearing potential) is not breastfeeding, has a negative serum pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to taking study drug, and agrees to abstain from activities that could result in pregnancy from enrollment through 180 days after the last dose of study treatment or is of nonchildbearing potential; or b) Female participant is of nonchildbearing potential, other than medical reasons, defined as follows: i) >=45 years of age and has not had menses for > 1 year. ii) Amenorrheic for < 2 years without a hysterectomy and oophorectomy and a follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) value in the postmenopausal range upon screening evaluation.\n\niii) Post hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or tubal ligation. Documented hysterectomy or oophorectomy must be confirmed with medical records of the actual procedure or confirmed by an ultrasound. Tubal ligation must be confirmed with medical records of the actual procedure, otherwise the participant must be willing to use 2 highly effective contraception methods throughout the study, starting with the screening visit through 180 days after the last dose of study therapy.\n\n* Male participant agrees to use an adequate method of contraception and not donate sperm starting with the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy.\n* Participant is able to understand the study procedures and agree to participate in the study by providing written informed consent.\n\nCohort Specific Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Cohorts 1 and 1A (combination of niraparib and PD-1 inhibitor): participants must have tumors with high PD-L1 expression (TPS >= 50%) per local assessment; with no known Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)-sensitizing mutation and/or ROS -1 or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) translocation, and no prior systemic chemotherapy or PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor treatment for metastatic NSCLC.\n* Cohorts 2 and 2A (combination of niraparib and PD-1 inhibitor): participants must have tumors with PD-L1 expression (TPS between 1% and 49%) per local assessment, with no known EGFR-sensitizing mutation and/or ROS-1 or ALK translocation, and no prior systemic chemotherapy or PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor treatment for metastatic NSCLC.\n* Cohort 3 (single agent niraparib): participants must have metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer (sqNSCLC) and have progressed after both prior platinum-based chemotherapy and prior PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor treatment.\n\nExclusion Criteria for Cohorts 1, 1A , 2 and 2A:\n\n* Participant has received systemic therapy for the treatment of advanced stage NSCLC. Completion of treatment with chemotherapy and/or radiation as part of neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy is allowed as long as therapy was completed at least 6 months prior to the diagnosis of metastatic disease.\n* Prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent.\n* Known hypersensitivity to the components of niraparib, pembrolizumab, TSR-042 (Dostarlimab), or their excipients.\n* Known EGFR (exon 19 and 21) mutations, ALK translocations, and/or ROS-1 translocations.\n* Participant has a history or current condition (such as transfusion-dependent anemia or thrombocytopenia), therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the study results, or interfere with the participant's participation for the full duration of the study treatment.\n* Known diagnosis of immunodeficiency or receiving systemic steroid therapy or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of study treatment.\n* Participant is immunocompromised, in the opinion of the Investigator.\n* Current participation in a treatment study or past participation in a study of an investigational agent within 4 weeks before the first dose of study treatment.\n* Symptomatic uncontrolled brain or leptomeningeal metastases.
