    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Prior histopathologically proven diagnosis of astrocytoma (grade 2-4) or oligodendroglioma (grade 2-3) according to the World Health Organization (WHO) 2021 Classification System that is progressive or recurrent following at least one prior alkylating chemotherapy regimen (i.e., temozolomide and/or lomustine), +/- radiation therapy\n2. Patient's tumor must have a known mutation in IDH1 or IDH2. IDH1/2 mutation status must be confirmed by DNA sequencing and could have been performed in any CLIA/CAP-certified laboratory.

Patients with exclusively non-enhancing tumors must have least a 25% increase in bi-dimensional product of FLAIR signal abnormality (measurable disease) compared to the patient's best MRI scan (smallest bi-dimensional product of FLAIR signal abnormality) obtained following completion of the patient's most recent line of therapy\n   * Safety Run-In: Must have failed temozolomide OR another alkylator (e.g. lomustine, procarbazine, carmustine). May have failed an unlimited number of prior systemic regimens, +/- prior radiotherapy.\n   * Arm A: Must have failed temozolomide AND another alkylator (e.g. lomustine, procarbazine, carmustine). May have failed an unlimited number of prior systemic regimens, +/- prior radiotherapy.\n   * Arm B: Must have failed temozolomide OR another alkylator (maximum one prior chemotherapy regimen) +/- prior radiotherapy, AND must have gone at least 12 months since last treatment (chemotherapy or radiotherapy).\n4. Surgical patients (Arm C and Arm D):\n\n   * Must have clinical indication for surgical resection of the suspected recurrent/progressive tumor, as determined by patient's care providers; measurable disease is not required\n   * 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) is not allowed for intraoperative tumor visualization due to the photosensitizing agent interaction with ATRA\n   * Patient may have had an unlimited number of relapses and prior therapy regimens\n5. Patient must have documented 1p/19q and O-6-methylguanine-deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methyltransferase (MGMT) methylation testing. If either of these has not been performed previously, they can be done prior to enrollment.\n6. Patients must be able to undergo MRI of the brain with gadolinium. Patients must be maintained on a stable or decreased dose of corticosteroid regimen (no increase for 5 days) prior to this baseline MRI.\n7.

Reproductive Status\n\n    1. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 7 days prior to the start of study drug.\n    2. b) Women must agree to not breastfeed during the study or for 180 days after the last dose of study treatment\n    3. WOCBP must agree to use an adequate method to avoid pregnancy (as defined below) from the time of study screening through 180 days from last dose of study drug\n    4. Males who are sexually active with WOCBP must agree to follow instructions for method(s) of contraception (as defined below) starting with the first dose of study drug through 180 days after the last dose of study\n    5. Azoospermic males and WOCBP who are continuously not heterosexually active are exempt from contraceptive requirements. However, these WOCBP must still undergo pregnancy testing as described in this section.\n\n    At a minimum, participants of childbearing potential who are sexually active and their partners must agree to the use of a highly effective form of contraception (as defined below) throughout their participation beginning with the time of consent, during the study treatment, and for 180 days after last dose of study treatment(s).\n\n    HIGHLY EFFECTIVE METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION:\n    * Hormonal methods of contraception including combined oral contraceptive pills, vaginal ring, injectables, implants and intrauterine devices (IUDs) by WOCBP subject or male subject's WOCBP partner. Female partners of male subjects participating in the study may use hormone-based contraceptives as one of the acceptable methods of contraception since they will not be receiving study drug\n    * Nonhormonal IUDs\n    * Bilateral Tubal ligation\n    * Vasectomy\n    * Sexual Abstinence\n\n      * It is not necessary to use any other method of contraception when complete abstinence is elected.\n      * WOCBP participants who choose complete abstinence must continue to have pregnancy tests.\n      * Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective contraception must be discussed in the event that the WOCBP participants chooses to forego complete abstinence.\n15.
