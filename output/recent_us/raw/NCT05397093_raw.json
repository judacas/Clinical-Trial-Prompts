    "inclusion_criteria": "* Males and females age â‰¥18 years\n* Able to understand, sign and date written informed consent\n* Written informed consent must be obtained before any assessment is performed\n* Subjects being considered for a possible diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis by\n* 1. One of the following conditions:\n\n  * Established systemic amyloidosis without proven cardiac involvement,\n  * Known plasma cell dyscrasia (MGUS, multiple myeloma),\n  * Pathological free light chain levels in urine or serum,\n  * Presence of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction\n* 2. AND one of the following parameters, indicative of cardiac manifestation:\n\n  * Mean (left ventricular (LV) wall + septum) thickness >12mm as measured by echocardiography in absence of other known cause of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH),\n  * NT-proBNP >335 ng/L\n* Planned diagnostic procedure to establish diagnosis and cardiac involvement (e.g., endomyocardial biopsy or extracardiac biopsy in conjunction with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging/echocardiography or bone scintigraphy)\n* Female subjects must be documented by medical records or physician's note to be either surgically sterile (by means of hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy) or post-menopausal for at least 1 year (no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause). If they are of child-bearing potential, they must commit to use of a highly effective contraceptive measure for at least one week following the PET scan\n* Male subjects and their partners of childbearing potential must commit to the use of a highly effective method of contraception for a minimum of 90 days following the PET scan\n* Male subjects must commit to not donate sperm for a minimum of 90 days after the PET scan\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
