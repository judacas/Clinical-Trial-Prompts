the following are exceptions:\n\n  * Intranasal, topical, inhaled, or local steroid injections (e.g., intra-articular injection)\n  * Chronic systemic corticosteroids at physiologic doses not to exceed 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent\n  * Steroids as premedication for hypersensitivity reaction (e.g., infusion-related reactions, computed tomography [CT] scan premedication)\n* Subject has plasma cell leukemia, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, POEMS syndrome (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal protein, and skin changes), or primary amyloidosis\n* Subjects with uncontrolled, systematic infection should be excluded\n* Subject has known chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) < 50% predicted normal; Note that FEV1 testing is required for patients suspected of having COPD and subjects must be excluded if FEV1 < 50%\n* Subject has known moderate or severe persistent asthma within 2 years, or currently has uncontrolled asthma of any classification; (Note that subjects who currently have controlled intermittent asthma or controlled mild persistent asthma are allowed in the study)\n* Subject has active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders (including inflammatory bowel disease [e.g., Crohn's disease], diverticulitis, celiac disease, irritable bowel disease, or other serious gastrointestinal chronic conditions associated with diarrhea; systemic lupus erythematosus; Wegener syndrome; myasthenia gravis; Graves' disease; rheumatoid arthritis; hypophysitis, uveitis, etc) within the past 3 years prior to the start of treatment; the following are exceptions:\n\n  * Subjects with vitiligo or alopecia\n  * Subjects with hypothyroidism (e.g., following Hashimoto's disease) stable on hormone replacement\n  * Psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment\n* Subject has known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to monoclonal antibodies or human proteins, or their excipients\n* Subject has history of primary immunodeficiency\n* Subject is seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1)\n* Active hepatitis A\n* Seropositive for hepatitis B (defined by a positive test for hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]);
