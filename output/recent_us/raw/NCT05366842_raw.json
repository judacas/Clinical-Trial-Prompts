Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 2.5 × ULN or ≤ 5 × ULN for subjects with known hepatic metastases\n    3. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 × ULN or ≤ 5 × ULN for subjects with known hepatic metastases\n13. Have adequate renal function as defined by the following criteria:\n\n    Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN and CrCl ≥ 30 ml/min per Cockcroft Gault formula:\n14. Have adequate hematologic function, defined as meeting all of the following criteria:\n\n    1. Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL (uncorrected by RBC transfusion)\n    2. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 × 109/L\n    3. Platelet count ≥ 100 × 109/L\n15. Have adequate coagulation functioning within 15 days prior to start of study treatment, defined by either of the following criteria:\n\n    1. INR < 1.5 × ULN\n    2. OR for subjects receiving warfarin or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), the subjects must, in the Investigator's opinion, be clinically stable with no evidence of active bleeding while receiving anticoagulant therapy. The INR for these subjects may exceed 1.5 × ULN if that is the goal of anticoagulant therapy.\n    3. Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) < 1.5 × ULN unless subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants\n16. Female subjects of childbearing potential as defined in Section 5.7.2 must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required.\n17. If of childbearing potential as defined in Section 5.7.2, must be willing to use an adequate method of contraception (see Section 5.7.2) from the first dose of study medication through 120 days after the last dose of study medication\n18. Be willing and have the ability to comply with scheduled visits (including geographical proximity), treatment plans, laboratory tests, and other study procedures\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
