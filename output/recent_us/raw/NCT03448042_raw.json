    "official_title": "Ability of Androgen-receptor Blockade to Normalize Progesterone-induced Augmentation of Gonadotropin Secretion in PCOS (CRM010)",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Post-pubertal (> 4 years post-menarche) adult woman aged 18-30 years\n* PCOS, defined as clinical and/or laboratory evidence of hyperandrogenism (hirsutism and/or elevated serum [calculated] free testosterone concentration) plus ovulatory dysfunction (irregular menses, fewer than 9 per year), but without evidence for other potential causes of hyperandrogenism and/or ovulatory dysfunction\n* General good health (excepting overweight, obesity, hyperandrogenism, PCOS, and adequately-treated hypothyroidism)\n* Capable of and willing to provide informed consent\n* Willing to strictly avoid pregnancy with use of reliable non-hormonal methods during the study period\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be FEMALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 30 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Inability/incapacity to provide informed consent\n* Males will be excluded (PCOS is unique to females)\n* Age < 18 years or > 30 years (ovarian reserve may decrease beyond age 30)\n* Obesity resulting from a well-defined endocrinopathy or genetic syndrome\n* Positive pregnancy test or current lactation\n* Evidence for non-physiologic or non-PCOS causes of hyperandrogenism and/or anovulation\n* Evidence of virilization (e.g., rapidly progressive hirsutism, deepening of the voice, clitoromegaly)\n* Total testosterone > 150 ng/dl, which suggests the possibility of virilizing ovarian or adrenal tumor\n* DHEA-S elevation > 1.5 times the upper reference range limit. Mild elevations may be seen in PCOS, and will be accepted in these groups\n* Early morning 17-hydroxyprogesterone > 200 ng/dl measured in the follicular phase, which suggests the possibility of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (if elevated during the luteal phase, the 17-hydroxyprogesterone will be repeated during the follicular phase). NOTE: If a 17-hydroxyprogesterone > 200 ng/dl is confirmed on repeat testing, an ACTH stimulated 17-hydroxyprogesterone < 1000 ng/dl performed by the subject's personal physician will be required for study participation.\n* Abnormal thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH): Note that subjects with stable and adequately treated primary hypothyroidism, reflected by normal TSH values, will not be excluded.\n* Hyperprolactinemia > 20% higher than the upper limit of normal. Mild prolactin elevations may be seen in women with PCOS, and elevations within 20% higher than the upper limit of normal will be accepted in this group.\n* History and/or physical exam findings suggestive of Cushing's syndrome, adrenal insufficiency, or acromegaly\n* History and/or physical exam findings suggestive of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (e.g., symptoms of estrogen deficiency) including functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (which may be suggested by a constellation of symptoms including restrictive eating patterns, excessive exercise, psychological stress, etc.)\n* Persistent hematocrit < 37% and hemoglobin < 12 g/dl\n* Severe thrombocytopenia (platelets < 50,000 cells/microliter) or leukopenia (total white blood count < 4,000 cells/microliter)\n* Previous diagnosis of diabetes, fasting glucose > or = 126 mg/dl, or a hemoglobin A1c > or = 6.5%\n* Given that this study involves flutamide use, any liver panel abnormality will be grounds for exclusion\n* Significant history of cardiac or pulmonary dysfunction (e.g., known or suspected congestive heart failure, asthma requiring intermittent systemic corticosteroids, etc.)\n* Decreased renal function evidenced by GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73m2\n* A personal history of breast, ovarian, or endometrial cancer\n* History of allergy to micronized progesterone, flutamide, or transdermal estradiol\n* BMI < 18 or > 40 kg/m2\n* Due to the amount of blood being drawn, volunteers with body weight < 110 pounds must be excluded",
