    "exclusion_criteria": "Patients who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from study entry.\n\nGeneral Exclusion Criteria:\n\n* Any prior systemic or radiotherapy within the last 4 months directed towards the squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck that is to be resected as part of SOC therapy.\n* Standard of care anticancer therapy, including chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or radiotherapy, for concurrent malignancy or unresected squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck within 3 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment.\n* AEs from prior anticancer therapy that have not resolved to Grade 1 except for alopecia, Grade 2 neuropathy or endocrine-related AEs Grade ≤2 requiring treatment or hormone replacement are eligible\n* Pregnancy, lactation, or breastfeeding\n* Inability to comply with study and follow-up procedures\n* Has a known active Hepatitis B (defined as Hepatitis B RNA detected) or known active Hepatitis C virus (defined as HCV RNA is detected) infection, or known active HIV (defined as HIV RNA is detected) infection.\n* Active tuberculosis\n* Severe infections within 4 weeks prior to treatment, including but not limited to hospitalization for complications of infection, bacteremia, or severe pneumonia\n* Signs or symptoms of infection as determined by the treating team within 2 weeks prior to treatment\n* Major surgical procedure within 28 days prior to treatment\n* Has received a live vaccine or live-attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug. Administration of killed or mRNA vaccines is allowed.\n* Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or has required active treatment within the past 3 years. Participants with basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, well-differentiated thyroid cancer, or carcinoma in situ that have undergone potentially curative therapy are not excluded.\n* History of significantly impaired cardiac function such as unstable angina pectoris, congestive heart failure with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV, myocardial infarction within the last 12 months prior to trial entry; signs of pericardial effusion, serious arrhythmia (including QTc prolongation of >470 ms and/or pacemaker) or prior diagnosis of congenital long QT syndrome or left ventricular ejection fraction <50% on echocardiogram.\n* History of cerebral vascular accident or stroke within the previous 2 years.\n* Uncontrolled hypertension (>160/100mm Hg).\n* History of Grade 3 or 4 allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemicalor biologic composition as TTI-101 (hydroxyl-naphthalene sulfonamides).\n* Patients with prior allogeneic bone marrow transplantation or prior solid organ transplantation\n* Previous treatment of the current malignancy with a STAT inhibitor.\n* Any other diseases, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that contraindicates the use of an investigational drug or that may affect the interpretation of the results or render the patient at high risk from treatment complications\n\nMedication-Related Exclusion Criteria:\n\n* Bisphosphonate therapy for symptomatic hypercalcemia\n\n  - Use of bisphosphonate therapy for other reasons (e.g., osteoporosis) is allowed.\n* Received oral or IV antibiotics within 2 weeks prior to treatment\n\n  - Patients receiving prophylactic antibiotics (e.g., for prevention of a urinary tract infection or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) are eligible.\n* Treatment with an investigational agent (not standard of care) within 3 weeks prior to treatment (or within five halflives of the investigational product, whichever is longer)\n* Treatment with systemic immunosuppressive medications (including but not limited to prednisone, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate, thalidomide, and anti-tumor necrosis factor [anti-TNF] agents) within 2 weeks prior to treatment\n\n  * Patients who have received acute, low dose, systemic immunosuppressant medications (e.g., a one-time dose of dexamethasone for nausea) may be enrolled.\n  * The use of inhaled corticosteroids and mineralocorticoids (e.g., fludrocortisone) for patients with orthostatic hypotension or adrenocortical insufficiency is allowed.",
