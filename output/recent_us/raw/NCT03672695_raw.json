The ELN definitions of resistance/intolerance to HU (hydroxyurea) requires the fulfillment of at least one of the following criteria:\n\n  * Platelet count greater than 600 × 109/L after 3 months of at least 2 g/day of HU (2.5 g/day in patients with a body weight over 80 kg);\n  * Platelet count greater than 400 × 109/L and leukocytes less than 2.5 × 109/L or hemoglobin (Hb) less than 100 g/L at any dose of HU;\n  * Presence of leg ulcers or other unacceptable mucocutaneous manifestations at any dose of HU;\n  * HU-related fever.\n* Requires treatment in order to lower platelet counts based on the Clinically Relevant IPSET (International Prognostic Score for Thrombosis in Essential Thrombocythemia) -Thrombosis Guidelines.\n* Platelet count >450 x 109/L pre-dose Day 1.\n* Peripheral blast count <10% pre-dose Day 1.\n* ANC (absolute neutrophil count) ≥0.5 x 109/L pre-dose Day 1.\n* Fibrosis Score ≤ grade 2, as per a slightly modified version (Arber et al., 2016) of the European Consensus Criteria for Grading Myelofibrosis, (Thiele et al., 2005).\n* Life expectancy > 36 weeks.\n* Able to swallow capsules.\n* Amenable to spleen size determination, bone marrow evaluations, and peripheral blood sampling during the study.\n* Must have discontinued ET therapy at least 2 weeks (4 weeks for interferon) prior to study drug initiation.\n* Agrees to use an approved method of contraception from Screening until 28 days after last administration of the study drug. Acceptable methods of birth control include: birth control pills, depo-progesterone injections, a vaginal hormonal contraceptive ring, a barrier contraceptive such as a condom with spermicide cream or gel, diaphragms or cervical cap with spermicide cream or gel, or an intrauterine device (IUD).\n* If male, agrees not to donate sperm or father a child for at least one month after the last dose of the study medication.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
