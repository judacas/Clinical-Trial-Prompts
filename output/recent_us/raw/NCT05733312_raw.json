Note: Patient with pre-HCT disease relapse will no be included if mIDH1 is not detected after relapse\n* Day 30 marrow post alloHCT should show evidence of morphologic remission with < 5% bone marrow (BM) blasts. Patients with MRD-positive status either by flow cytometry or IDH1 mutation testing will be eligible\n* Patients with previous therapy with IDH1 inhibitors will be included\n* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) > 1000/mm^3 (within 28 days prior to day 1 of protocol)\n* Hemoglobin ≥ 8.0 gm/dL (within 28 days prior to day 1 of protocol)\n* Platelets ≥ 50,000/mm^3 (within 28 days prior to day 1 of protocol) Note: Patients with lower counts can enroll if infection cytomegalovirus (CMV)/human herpes virus 6 (HHV6), etc. is being treated actively\n* Bilirubin ≤ 2 x upper limit of normal (ULN) (within 28 days prior to day 1 of protocol) (unless has Gilbert's disease).

Patients with abnormal LFTs due to active GVHD will not be eligible\n* Creatinine clearance of ≥ 30/min/1.73 m^2 for participants with creatinine levels above institutional normal per 24 hour urine test or the Cockcroft-Gault formula (within 28 days prior to day 1 of protocol)\n* Corrected QT interval (QTc) ≤ 480 ms (Note: To be performed within 28 days prior to day 1 of protocol therapy)\n* Seronegative for HIV antigen/antibody (Ag/Ab) combo, hepatitis C virus (HCV) (if positive, hepatitis C ribonucleic acid [RNA] quantitation must be performed), active hepatitis B virus (HBV) (surface antigen negative), and syphilis (rapid plasma reagin [RPR]) (within 28 days prior to day 1 of protocol)\n* Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP): negative urine or serum pregnancy test (within 28 days prior to day 1 of protocol). If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required\n* Agreement by females and males of childbearing potential, defined as not being surgically sterilized (men and women) or have not been free from menses for > 1 year (women only), to use an effective method of birth control or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course of the study through at least 3 months after the last dose of protocol therapy\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",

Participants with history of prior malignancy treated with curative intent who achieved CR more than 2 years before study entry are eligible. This exclusion rule does not apply to non-melanoma skin tumors and in-situ cervical cancer\n* Females only: Pregnant or breastfeeding\n* Active grade II-IV acute GVHD per Mount Sinai Acute Graft Versus Host Disease International Consortium (MAGIC) criteria and/or requiring systemic steroids with prednisone dose equivalent of ≥ 0.25 mg/kg at end of 4 weeks.
