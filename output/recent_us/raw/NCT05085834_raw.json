    "inclusion_criteria": "* Adults aged ≥ 18 years at screening (Note: Legal adult age for Korea is ≥ 19 years).\n* Diagnosis of AD as defined by the Hanifin and Rajka (1980) criteria.\n* AD duration of at least 2 years.\n* IGA score of 3 at screening and Day 1.\n* EASI score > 7 at screening and Day 1.\n* Itch NRS score ≥ 4 at Day 1, defined as the average of the 7 days directly before Day 1, with Itch NRS values available for at least 4 of the 7 days.\n* %BSA (excluding the scalp) with AD involvement of at least 10% and up to 20% at screening and Day 1.\n* DLQI score > 10 at screening and Day 1.\n* Documented recent history (within 12 months before the screening visit) of inadequate response, intolerance, or contraindication to TCSs and TCIs.\n* Agree to discontinue all agents used to treat AD from screening through the final follow up visit, except as outlined in the protocol.\n* Willingness to avoid pregnancy or fathering children based on the criteria as outlined in the protocol.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Unstable course of AD (spontaneously improving or rapidly deteriorating) as determined by the investigator in the 4 weeks prior to Day 1.\n* Concurrent conditions and history of other diseases as follows:\n\n  * Immunocompromised (eg, lymphoma, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome).\n  * Chronic or acute infection requiring treatment with systemic antibiotics, antivirals, antiparasitics, antiprotozoals, or antifungals within 2 weeks before Day 1.\n  * Active acute bacterial, fungal, or viral skin infection (eg, herpes simplex, herpes zoster, chickenpox) within 1 week before Day 1.\n  * Any other concomitant skin disorder (eg, generalized erythroderma, such as Netherton syndrome), pigmentation, or extensive scarring that, in the opinion of the investigator, may interfere with the evaluation of AD lesions or compromise participant safety.\n  * Presence of AD lesions only on the hands or feet without prior history of involvement of other classic areas of involvement such as the face or the flexural folds.\n  * Other types of eczema within the 6 months prior to screening. Note: Seborrheic dermatitis on the scalp is allowed, as the scalp will not be treated with study cream.\n  * Current or history of hepatitis B or C virus infection.\n* Any serious illness or medical, physical, or psychiatric condition(s) that, in the investigator's opinion, would interfere with full participation in the study, including administration of study cream and attending required study visits; pose a significant risk to the participant; or interfere with interpretation of study data.\n* Any of the following clinical laboratory test results at screening:\n\n  * Hemoglobin < 10 g/dL.\n  * Liver function tests:\n\n    * AST or ALT ≥ 2 × ULN.\n    * Alkaline phosphatase > 1.5 × ULN.\n    * Bilirubin > 1.5 × ULN (isolated bilirubin > 1.5 × ULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin < 35%) with the exception of Gilbert's disease.\n  * Estimated glomerular filtration rate < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation).\n  * Positive serology test results for HIV antibody.\n  * Any other clinically significant laboratory result that, in the opinion of the investigator, poses a significant risk to the participant.\n* Use of any of the following treatments within the indicated washout period before Day 1:\n\n  * 5 half-lives or 12 weeks, whichever is longer: biologic agents. For biologic agents with washout periods longer than 12 weeks (eg, rituximab), consult the medical monitor.\n  * 4 weeks: systemic corticosteroids or adrenocorticotropic hormone analogs, cyclosporine, methotrexate, azathioprine, or other systemic immunosuppressive (eg, JAK inhibitors) or immunomodulating agents (eg, mycophenolate or tacrolimus).\n  * 2 weeks or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer - strong systemic CYP3A4 inhibitors.\n  * 2 weeks: immunizations with live-attenuated vaccines; sedating antihistamines unless on a long-term stable regimen (nonsedating antihistamines are permitted).\n\nNote: COVID-19 vaccination is allowed.\n\n• 1 week: use of other topical treatments for AD, other than bland emollients (eg, Aveeno creams, ointments, sprays, soap substitutes), such as antipruritics (eg, doxepin cream), corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, PDE4 inhibitors, coal tar (shampoo), antibiotics, or antibacterial cleansing body wash/soap.\n\nNote: Diluted sodium hypochlorite \"bleach\" baths are allowed as long as they do not exceed 2 baths per week and their frequency remains the same throughout the study.\n\n* History of treatment failure with any systemic or topical JAK inhibitor (eg, ruxolitinib, tofacitinib, baricitinib, abrocitinib, upadacitinib) for AD or any other inflammatory condition.\n* Ultraviolet light therapy or prolonged exposure to natural or artificial sources of UV radiation (eg, sunlight or tanning booth) within 2 weeks prior to the baseline visit and/or intention to have such exposure during the study that is thought by the investigator to potentially impact the participant's AD.\n* Current treatment or treatment within 30 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) before baseline with another investigational medication or current enrollment in another investigational drug protocol.\n* In the opinion of the investigator, are unable or unlikely to comply with the administration schedule, study evaluations, and procedures (eg, eDiary compliance).\n\nOther protocol-defined Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria may apply.",
