    "official_title": "A Pilot Study of the Combination of 5-azacitidine (5-AZA) and All-trans Retinoic Acid (ATRA) for Prostate Cancer (PCa) With PSA-only Recurrence After Definitive Local Treatment",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate\n* Rising PSA\n* PSADT ≤ 10 months prior to initiation of ADT\n* No evidence of regional or active distant metastases, except for regional metastasis where salvage radiation therapy is not an option\n* Indication for ADT after receiving definitive local therapy\n* Males ≥ 18 years.\n* ECOG performance status of ≤ 2\n* Men must agree to use a condom and not father a child or donate sperm for the duration of the study and for 90 days after completion of therapy\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent\n* Ability to adhere to the study visit schedule and requirements of the protocol\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be MALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Patients who have received ADT and/or other chemotherapy within 3 months prior to entering the study.\n* Patients who have had radiotherapy or surgery within 4 weeks prior to entering the study. Minimally-invasive procedures for the purpose of diagnosis or staging of the disease are permitted.\n* Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.\n* Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to 5-AZA and ATRA.\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* Significant active cardiac disease within the previous 6 months\n* Inadequate organ and marrow function as defined below:\n* leukocytes ≤ 3,000/mcL\n* absolute neutrophil count ≤ 1,500/mcL\n* platelets ≤ 100,000/mcl\n* total bilirubin above normal institutional limits\n* AST(SGOT)/ALT(SPGT) ≥ 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal\n* creatinine above normal institutional limits",
