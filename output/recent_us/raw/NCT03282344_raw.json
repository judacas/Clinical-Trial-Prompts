If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required\n* FOCBP agree to use a highly-effective method of contraception starting with the first dose of study therapy up to 7 months after the last dose of study therapy\n\n  * FOCBP are those who are not proven postmenopausal. Postmenopausal is defined as:\n\n    * Amenorrheic for > 24 consecutive months following cessation of exogenous hormonal treatments\n    * Luteinizing hormone (LH) and Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels in the post menopausal range for women under 50 years of age\n    * Radiation-induced oophorectomy with last menses > 1 year ago\n    * Chemotherapy-induced menopause with > 1 year interval since last menses\n    * Surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy or tubal ligation)\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 100 Years",
