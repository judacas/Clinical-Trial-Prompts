    "inclusion_criteria": "* Patients with biopsy proven R/M HNSCC that is considered incurable by local therapies.\n\n  * Participant must have at least 2 lesions\n\n    * At least one lesion will be the target lesion, which will be injected with NBTXR3 and radiated and must be in either the head and neck (HN) or lung or liver.\n    * The other lesion will be a non-target lesion, which will not be treated with NBTXR3 or RT, but will be followed for response.\n  * Prior systemic therapy (i.e., chemotherapy or targeted therapy) given as part of multimodal treatment for locally advanced disease is allowed.\n  * Prior anti-PD-1/L1 therapy allowed in the PD-1 refractory cohort (cohort 2)\n* Have results from testing of human papillomavirus (HPV) status for oropharyngeal cancer defined as p16 immunohistochemistry (IHC) testing using CINtec p16 Histology assay, or equivalent, and a 70% cutoff point.\n\n  * If HPV status previously tested using aforementioned method or an equivalent, no additional testing needed.\n  * Oral cavity, hypopharynx, and larynx cancer are not required to undergo HPV testing by p16 IHC as by convention these tumor locations are assumed to be HPV negative\n* Have provided tissue for PD-L1 biomarker analysis from a core or excisional biopsy, fine needle aspirate (FNA) not adequate.\n\n  * A newly obtained biopsy (within 90 days prior to NBTXR3 injection is preferred), but an archival sample is acceptable.\n  * PD-1/L1 naive patients with 1% =< combined positive score (CPS) < 20 based on IHC testing.\n  * PD-1/L1 refractory patients all CPS levels allowed\n* Amenable to undergo the image guided intratumoral/intranodal injection of NBTXR3 in up to 3 target lesions, as per investigator or treating physician discretion.\n\n  * For the HN target lesions (< 60 cm^3 per site, total volume < 120 cm^3) may be injected and irradiated, including the primary tumor and involved lymph node(s).\n  * For the lung or liver target lesion no maximum volume threshold has been defined. However, target lesions must be amenable to receive NBTXR3 injection and RT (50 Gy in 4 fx or 60 Gy in 10 fx)\n* The selected target lesion and non-target lesion should be measurable as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v)1.1 on cross sectional imaging and repeated measurements at the same anatomical location should be achievable\n\n  * Target lesion(s) must be located in the HN or lung or liver\n  * Target lesion must be amenable to receive RT regimens specified in this protocol at the discretion of the investigator or treating radiation oncologist.\n  * Nodal target lesions must be â‰¥15mm (short axis) based on CT (slice thickness of 5 mm or less) or MRI\n* Age >= 18 years\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2\n* Hemoglobin >= 9.0 g/dL\n* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >= 1,000/mm^3\n* Platelet count >= 100,000/mm^3\n* Leukocytes >= 1500/mm^3\n* Calculated (Calc.) creatinine clearance > 40 mL/min\n* Total bilirubin =< 2.0 mg/dL\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) =< 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) or =< 5 x ULN for patients with liver metastasis\n* For patients with lung metastases, adequate lung function with expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) >= 0.8 L or >= 35% predicted and carbon monoxide diffusing capability (DLCO) >= 40% with or without bronchodilator within 28 days prior to NBTXR3 injection\n* Patients who meet the criterion above without oxygen (O2), but need acute (started within 7 +/- 3 days) supplemental oxygen due to tumor-caused obstruction/hypoxia are eligible, provided the amount of the O2 needed has been stable\n* Negative urine or serum pregnancy test =< 7 days prior to NBTXR3 injection in all women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP). WOCBP must agree to follow instructions for method(s) of contraception for the duration the entire study period and 6 months after the last dose of anti-PD-1 treatment. Local laws and regulations may require use of alternative and/or additional contraception methods. WOCBP who are continuously not heterosexually active are exempt from contraceptive requirements but should still undergo pregnancy testing\n* Signed informed consent form (ICF) indicating that participant understands the purpose of, and procedures required for, the study and is willing to participate in the study\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
