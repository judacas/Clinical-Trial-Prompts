    "exclusion_criteria": "* Patients with known symptomatic brain metastases requiring systemic corticosteroids; patients with previously diagnosed brain metastases are eligible if they have completed their treatment and have recovered from the acute effects of radiation therapy or surgery prior to the start of study medication, have discontinued corticosteroid treatment for these metastases for at least 4 weeks and are neurologically stable; mild neurological deficit is allowed, if it does not interfere with the ability to judge the safety on the trial\n* Prior treatment with an mTOR inhibitor (including, but not limited to, everolimus, temsirolimus, sirolimus, and ridaforolimus)\n* Prior treatment with axitinib\n* History of or active autoimmune disorders (including but not limited to: Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, systemic lupus erythematosus, Grave's disease) and other conditions that compromise or impair the immune system\n* Active bacterial, fungal or viral infection including hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C (HCV), known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) -related illness\n* Any condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (> 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days prior to the first dose of study drug; inhaled steroids and adrenal replacement steroid doses > 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease\n* Uncontrolled adrenal insufficiency\n* Any known active chronic liver disease\n* Prior malignancy active within the previous 3 years except for locally curable cancers that have been apparently cured, such as basal or squamous cell skin cancer, superficial bladder cancer, or carcinoma in situ of the prostate, cervix or breast\n* Known medical condition (e.g., a condition associated with diarrhea or acute diverticulitis) that, in the investigator's opinion, would increase the risk associated with study participation or study drug administration or interfere with the interpretation of safety results\n* Prior treatment with an anti-CD137, or OX40 antibody, or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation or checkpoint pathways except anti-PD1, anti-PDL1/2 antibodies or ipilimumab\n* Major surgery less than 6 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug; minor surgery less than 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug\n* Anti-cancer therapy less than 6 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug (less than 28 days for bevacizumab) or palliative, focal radiation therapy less than 14 days prior to the first dose of study drug\n* Presence of toxicities attributed to prior therapy other than alopecia that have not resolved to grade 1 (National Cancer Institute [NCI] Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] version 4) or baseline before administration of study drug\n* History of grade 3 or higher immune-mediated adverse event (including AST/ALT elevations that where considered drug related and cytokine release syndrome) that was considered related to prior immune-modulatory therapy (e.g., checkpoint inhibitors, costimulatory agents etc.) or any grade immune-related adverse events (AEs) that required immune suppressive therapy\n* Patients with intolerance to or who have had a severe (>= grade 3) allergic or anaphylactic reaction to antibodies or infused therapeutic proteins, or patients who have had a severe allergic or anaphylactic reaction to any of the substances included in the investigational product (including excipients)\n* Patients with a previous history of adriamycin treatment and are at risk of cardiac failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class II or above)\n* Any one of the following currently or in the previous 6 months:\n\n  * Myocardial infarction\n  * Congenital long QT syndrome\n  * Torsade's de points\n  * Arrhythmias (including sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia and ventricular fibrillation), and left anterior hemiblock (bifascicular block)\n  * Unstable angina, coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft\n  * Symptomatic congestive heart failure (congestive heart failure [CHF] New York Heart Association class III or IV)\n  * Cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic attack or symptomatic pulmonary embolism or other clinical significant episode of thrombo-embolic disease (Cases must be discussed in detail with study chair to judge eligibility;
