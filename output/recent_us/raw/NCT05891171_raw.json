Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative serum screening for pregnancy within 14 days prior to screening. Women and men of child-bearing potential must agree to use highly effective methods of birth control before entry and throughout the study, for up to 12 weeks following the last dose of ON 123300.\n8. Patients must understand and voluntarily sign an ICF prior to any study-related assessments/procedures being conducted;\n9. Patients must have the ability to understand the nature of the study and any hazards of participating in the study and communicate satisfactorily with the investigator to participate in the study.\n10. Patients must be willing and able to adhere and comply to the requirements of the entire study including study visit schedule and other protocol requirements;\n11. Have adequate organ function, including:\n\n    a. Hematologic: i. absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1.0 × 109/Liter (L) ii. platelets ≥100 × 109/L, and iii. hemoglobin ≥8 g/deciliter (dL). b. Hepatic: i. Total bilirubin ≤1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) and ii. alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤3.0 times ULN (or ALT and AST ≤5 times ULN if liver metastases are present).\n\n    c. Renal: i. Serum creatinine ≤1.5 times ULN. or estimated creatinine clearance (calculated according to normal institutional practice) greater than 50 ml/min.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Patients that have any significant medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric illness that would prevent the patient from participating in the study or present an unacceptable risk to the patient;\n2. Patients at risk for Torsades de pointes (TdP):\n\n   1. Who have a marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval (e.g., repeated demonstration of a QTc interval >480 milliseconds (ms) (CTCAE grade 1) using Fredericia's QT correction formula, or\n   2. who have a history of additional risk factors for TdP (e.g., heart failure, hypokalemia, family history of Long QT Syndrome), or\n   3. who are currently taking medications that prolong the QT/QTc interval;\n3. Patients with a diagnosis of hematological malignancies except for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma;\n4.

History of allergic reaction attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition/structure to ON 123300 (e.g. prior CDK4/6 inhibitors);\n7. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including but not limited to ongoing or active infection, bleeding, congestive heart failure, unstable angina, cardiac arrhythmia, oxygen-dependent lung disease, psychiatric illness/social situations that limit participation compliance with study procedures and requirements;\n8. Patients with a recent history of venous thromboembolic events, defined as event occurring ≤ 6 months prior to screening and also currently on therapy;\n9. Patients with baseline Grade ≥ 2 diarrhea;\n10. Patients with Grade ≥ 3 hypercalcemia (Corrected serum calcium > 12.5 mg/dL);\n11. Pregnant or nursing mothers;\n12.
