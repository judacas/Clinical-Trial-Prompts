    "official_title": "A Phase 3 Randomized, Double-Blind Clinical Study of Pembrolizumab + Epacadostat vs Pembrolizumab + Placebo as a Treatment for Recurrent or Progressive Metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma in Patients Who Have Failed a First-Line Platinum-containing Chemotherapy Regimen for Advanced/Metastatic Disease (KEYNOTE-698/ECHO-303)",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Histologically-confirmed diagnosis of urothelial carcinoma of the renal pelvis, ureter, bladder, or urethra, that is transitional cell, or mixed transitional/non-transitional (predominantly transitional) cell type.\n* Progression or recurrence of urothelial carcinoma following one prior platinum containing chemotherapy regimen for metastatic or unresectable locally advanced disease. A participant who receives a neoadjuvant or adjuvant platinum-containing regimen following cystectomy for localized muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma is acceptable (without further systemic treatment), if recurrence/progression occurs â‰¤ 12 months following completion of therapy.\n* Measurable disease based on RECIST v1.1.\n* Have provided an archival tumor tissue sample or newly obtained core or excisional biopsy of a tumor lesion not previously irradiated for PD-L1 analysis.\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.\n* Adequate organ function per protocol-defined criteria.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Urothelial carcinoma that is suitable for local therapy with curative intent.\n* History or presence of an abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) that, in the investigator's opinion, is clinically meaningful.\n* Known additional malignancy that is progressing or has required active treatment within the past 3 years.\n* Known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Participants with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are radiologically stable, ie, without evidence of progression for at least 4 weeks by repeat imaging.\n* Active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in past 2 years.\n* Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. HIV testing is not required unless mandated by local health authority.\n* Known history of or is positive for active hepatitis B (HBsAg reactive) or has active hepatitis C (HCV RNA).
