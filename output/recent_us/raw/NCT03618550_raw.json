Patients must have normal organ and bone marrow function measured within 7 days prior to administration of study treatment as defined below: i. Hemoglobin >/= 10.0 g/dL dL (unless due to bone marrow infiltration by tumor, in which case hemoglobin >/=8gdL is allowed). Patient may have blood transfusions prior to study enrollment. ii. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >/= 1.5 x 10^9/L (unless due to bone marrow infiltration by tumor, in which case ANC >1,000/mm3 is allowed) iii.

No features suggestive of myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia on peripheral blood smear v. Platelet count >/= 100 x 10^9/L (unless due to bone marrow infiltration by tumor, in which case platelet >/=50,000/ mm3 is allowed) vi. Total bilirubin </=1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) (except for patients with known Gilbert's disease).\n13. (continued from Inclusion Criteria #11 vii. aspartate aminotransferase (serum glutamine oxaloacetic transminase) and alanine aminotransferase (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase) </= 2.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (unless liver metastases are present in which case it must be </= 5x ULN) viii. Calculated creatinine clearance (Cockcroft-Gault Equation) >/= 40 mL/min.\n14. Able to swallow study drugs whole as a tablet/capsule.\n15. Patients who have partners of childbearing potential (e.g. female that has not been surgically sterilized or who are not amenorrheic for >/= 12 months) must be willing to use a method of birth control in addition to adequate barrier protection as determined to be acceptable by the investigator during the study and for 13 weeks after last study drug administration. Please note that the efficacy of hormonal contraception may be decreased if administered with olaparib.\n16. Patient is willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study including undergoing treatment and scheduled visits and examinations including follow up.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be MALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Involvement in the planning and/or conduct of the study (applies to both AstraZeneca staff and/or staff at MD Anderson)\n2. Previous enrolment or randomization in the present study\n3. Any prior treatment for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) with carboplatin, cisplatin, cabazitaxel or olaparib.\n4. Patients whose disease is refractory (defined as evidence of disease progression while on drug or within 3 months of its discontinuation) to more than 2 lines of chemotherapy given for CRPC. Any number of chemotherapies to which the patient's disease is not refractory are allowed, as long as time on treatment did not exceed 6 months (counted from day 1 of cycle 1 to day 1 of the last cycle of treatment).\n5. Patients who have not recovered from adverse events secondary to systemic therapy (except for luteinizing hormone-releasing (LHRH) hormone agonist or antagonist treatment for prostate cancer, and bisphosphonates or receptor activator of Nf kappa (RANK) ligand inhibitors for bone strengthening), major surgery or radiotherapy for the treatment of prostate cancer to a grade </= 2.\n6. Persistent toxicities (>/= common terminology criteria for adverse events grade 2) with the exception of alopecia, caused by previous cancer therapy.\n7. Chronic use of known strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, indinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, clarithromycin, voriconazole, nefazodone, posaconazole, ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, indinavir, saquinavir, boceprevir, telaprevir and nelfinavir), moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. amprenavir, aprepitant, atazanavir, ciprofloxacin, crizotinib, darunavir/ritonavir, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, imatinib, verapamil), strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. phenytoin, rifampicin, carbamazepine, St.John's Wort, phenobarbital) and moderate CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. bosentan, efavirenz, etravirine, modafinil and nafcillin). Concomitant use of these drugs with olaparib is not allowed. Patients may undergo limited courses of them prior to starting olaparib but will be required to have >/= 5 week washout period from phenobarbital, and >/=3 week washout period from the rest, before randomization.\n8. Active uncontrolled infection ( patients completing a course of antibiotic or antiviral therapy whose infection is deemed to be controlled may be allowed on study after discussion with the PI; the PI will serve as the final arbiter regarding eligibility).\n9. Active or symptomatic viral hepatitis or chronic liver disease.\n10. A diagnosis or suspicion of myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia.\n11. A history of pneumonitis or extensive bilateral lung disease of non-malignant etiology.\n12. A malignancy [other than the one treated in this study] which required radiotherapy or systemic treatment within the past 5 years, or has a >/= 30% probability of recurrence within 24 months (except for adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer, curatively treated in-situ cancer of the Ta urothelial carcinomas).\n13. Any underlying medical or psychiatric condition, which in the opinion of the Investigator, will make the administration of study drug hazardous or obscure the interpretation of adverse events. Examples include, but are not limited to, uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia, recent (within 3 months) myocardial infarction, superior vena cava syndrome, extensive bilateral lung disease on high-resolution computed tomography scan, uncontrolled seizures or any psychiatric disorder that prohibits obtaining informed consent.\n14. Patients unable to swallow orally administered medication and patients with gastrointestinal disorders likely to interfere with absorption of the study medication.\n15. Patients with symptomatic uncontrolled brain metastases or spinal cord compressions. A scan to confirm the absence of brain metastases is not required. The patient can receive a stable dose of corticosteroids before and during the study as long as these were started at least 28 days prior to treatment.\n16. Patients with a known hypersensitivity to the olaparib, carboplatin or cabazitaxel.\n17. Prisoners or subjects who are involuntarily incarcerated.\n18. Subjects who are compulsorily detained for treatment of either a psychiatric or physical (e.g. infectious disease) illness.",
