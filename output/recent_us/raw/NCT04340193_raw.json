    "inclusion_criteria": "* Male or female participants aged ≥18 years.\n* Unresectable, incurable, locally advanced or metastatic epithelial-origin solid tumor that is refractory to standard therapies, or has no approved standard therapies, or no approved standard therapies at its current treatment stage.

Study participants on therapeutic doses of anticoagulation medication must have INR and/or aPTT ≤ the upper limit of the therapeutic range for intended use\n* Have recovered (ie, improvement to Grade 1 or better) from all acute toxicities from previous therapy, excluding alopecia and vitiligo.\n\nBHV-1510 in Combination with specific inclusion criteria:\n\n* histologically or cytologically documented advanced (locally, recurrent, inoperable, cannot be treated with curative intent) or metastatic cancer.\n* received ≤ 2 prior lines of systemic anti-cancer therapy and at most one prior anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) (programmed death-ligand 1 [PD-L1]) therapy for advanced/ metastatic disease.\n\nKey\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Women who are pregnant or lactating.\n* Clinically significant intercurrent disease.\n* Has symptomatic brain metastases or has had any radiation or surgery for brain metastases within 4 weeks of C1D1.\n* Has clinically significant corneal disease.\n* Requires supplemental oxygen for daily activities.\n* Previous treatment with a Trop-2-targeted therapy, including Trop-2 ADCs.\n* Has a medical history of interstitial lung disease (eg, noninfectious interstitial pneumonia requiring steroid treatment, pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, or severe radiation pneumonitis) or current interstitial lung disease or are suspected to have any of these diseases based on imaging at Screening.\n* Any standard cancer therapy (eg, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, biologic therapy treatment) or experimental therapy within 3 weeks or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter, prior to C1D1. The interval may be reduced to 2 weeks for bone-only radiation therapy. Any major surgical procedure within 6 weeks prior to C1D1.\n* History of severe hypersensitivity reactions to other monoclonal antibodies or either the drug substances or inactive ingredients of BHV-1510.\n* History of interstitial lung disease (eg, noninfectious interstitial pneumonia requiring steroid treatment, pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, or severe radiation pneumonitis) or current interstitial lung disease or are suspected to have any of these diseases based on most recent imaging.\n\nBHV-1510 in Combination Specific Exclusion Criteria:\n\n* Hypersensitivity to cemiplimab or any of its excipients or contraindicated to cemiplimab per approved local labeling.\n* Experienced Grade 3 or higher immune-related AEs with prior treatment of anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent or with an agent directed to another stimulatory or co-inhibitory T-cell receptor (eg, CTLA-4, OX 40, CD137).\n* Prior allogeneic stem cell or solid organ transplantation.\n* Patients with history of myocarditis.",
