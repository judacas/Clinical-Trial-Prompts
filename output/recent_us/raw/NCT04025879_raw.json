    "official_title": "Feasibility Study of a Bronchoscopic Ultrasound-Guided Tissue Acquisition System With Real-time Visualization for Collection of Cytology Specimens of Peripheral Pulmonary Lesions",
    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Subject is age 18 years or older.\n2. Subject is willing and able to comply with study procedures and provide written informed consent to participate in study.\n3. Subject with a predominantly solid lung lesion, 1 cm to 7 cm in diameter, which has been identified on chest CT (obtained within 6 weeks) with the intention to undergo a clinically indicated bronchoscopic evaluation under routine clinical care. If the lesion is partially solid (i.e. there is a ground glass component) then the solid portion must make up 80% of the lesion.\n4. Subject for whom the decision to pursue biopsy has been made by the treating physician and agreed upon by the subject.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Subjects with pure ground glass opacity, a subsolid target lesion, and/or a ground glass opacity identified on Chest CT.\n2. Subjects with lesions that include endobronchial involvement, per Chest CT.\n3. Subjects who lack fitness to undergo flexible bronchoscopy and standard of care Radial EBUS-guided cytological assessment evaluations, as determined by the investigator.\n4. Subjects with known coagulopathy.\n5. Subjects who are pregnant or nursing mothers.\n6. Subjects who are currently enrolled in another investigational study that would directly interfere with the current study, without prior written approval from the sponsor.",
