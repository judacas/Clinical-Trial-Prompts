    "inclusion_criteria": "1.1 INCLUSION CRITERIA\n\n1. Diagnosis: ALL In view of the PI and the primary oncologist, there must be no available alternative curative therapies or subject has declined to pursue alternative therapy; and subjects must be either ineligible for allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT), have refused SCT, recurred after SCT, or have disease activity that prohibits SCT at the time of enrollment.\n\n   1. Chemotherapy refractory disease in subjects with B-ALL is defined as progression or stable disease after two lines of therapies\n   2. Recurrence of disease after achieving a complete response (CR).\n   3. Subjects with persistent or relapsed minimal residual disease (MRD) (by flow cytometry, PCR, FISH, or next generation sequencing) require verification of MRD positivity on two occasions at least 4 weeks apart.\n   4. Subjects with Philadelphia Chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ALL) subjects are eligible if they progressed, had stable disease or relapsed after two lines of therapy, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).\n   5. Subjects with recurrence of isolated CNS relapse after achieving complete remission (CR); if relapsed with MRD, will require verification of MRD positivity on two occasions at least 4 weeks apart.\n2. Diagnosis: Lymphoma Subjects with lymphoma must have progressed, had SD, or recurred after initial treatment regimens that include an anthracycline and an anti CD20 monoclonal antibody. Subjects who relapse ≥12 months after therapy should have progressed after autologous transplant or been ineligible for autologous transplant.\n3. CD19 expression CD19 expression is required at any time since diagnosis. If patient has received anti-CD19 targeted therapy (i.e. Blinatumomab), then CD19 expression must be subsequently demonstrated. CD19 expression. must be detected on greater than 50% of the malignant cells by immunohistochemistry or ≥ 90% by flow cytometry. The choice of whether to use flow cytometry or immunohistochemistry will be determined by what is the most easily available tissue sample in each subject. In general, immunohistochemistry will be used for lymph node biopsies, flow cytometry will be used for peripheral blood and bone marrow samples.\n4. Subjects who have undergone autologous SCT with disease progression or relapse following SCT will be eligible if all other eligibility criteria are met. Subjects who have undergone allogeneic SCT will be eligible if, in addition to meeting other eligibility criteria, they are at least 100 days post-transplant, they have no evidence of active GVHD and have been without immunosuppressive agents for at least 30 days.\n5. Subjects who have undergone prior anti-CD19 or anti-CD22 CAR therapy will be eligible if < 5% of circulating levels of CD3+ cells express the previous CAR by flow cytometry.\n6. Must have evaluable or measurable disease; subjects with lymphoma must have evaluable or measurable disease according to the revised IWG Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma[66] must be present. Lesions that have been previously irradiated will be considered measurable only if progression has been documented following completion of radiation therapy.\n7. At least 2 weeks or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter, must have elapsed since any prior systemic therapy at the time the subject is planned for leukapheresis, except for systemic inhibitory/stimulatory immune checkpoint therapy, which requires 5 half-lives.\n\n   Exceptions:\n\n   f. There is no time restriction with regard to prior intrathecal chemotherapy (incl. steroids) provided there is complete recovery from any acute toxic effects of such; g. Subjects receiving hydroxyurea may be enrolled provided there has been no increase in dose for at least 2 weeks prior to starting apheresis; h. Subjects who are on standard ALL maintenance type chemotherapy (vincristine, 6-mercaptopurine or oral methotrexate) may be enrolled provided that chemotherapy is discontinued at least 1 week prior to apheresis.\n\n   i. Subjects receiving steroid therapy at physiologic replacement doses (≤ 5 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent doses of other corticosteroids) only are allowed provided there has been no increase in dose for at least 2 weeks prior to starting apheresis; j. For radiation therapy: Radiation therapy must have been completed at least 3 weeks prior to enrollment, with the exception that there is no time restriction if the volume of bone marrow treated is less than 10% and also the subject has measurable/evaluable disease outside the radiation port.\n8. Toxicities due to prior therapy must be stable and recovered to ≤ Grade 1 (except for clinically non-significant toxicities, such as alopecia, nutritional support measures, electrolyte abnormalities, or those not impacting the investigator's ability to assess treatment emergent toxicities)\n9. Age Greater than or equal to 1 year of age and less than or equal to 30 years of age at time of enrollment; must meet parameters for apheresis per institutional guidelines. NOTE: The first subject in the first dose cohort must be ≥ 18 years of age if an adult has not been treated at that dose cohort on the companion Stanford protocol \"Phase 1 Dose Escalation Study of CD19/CD22 Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T Cells in Adults with Recurrent or Refractory B Cell Malignancies\" and undergone safety evaluation at Day 28 without evidence of DLT.\n10.

Absolute lymphocyte count ≥150/uL*\n    4. Adequate renal, hepatic, pulmonary and cardiac function defined as:\n\n       * Serum ALT/AST ≤10 ULN (unless elevated ALT/AST is attributed to leukemia or lymphoma involvement of the liver, in which case this criterion will be waived and not disqualify a patient).\n       * Total bilirubin ≤1.5 mg/dl, except in subjects with Gilbert's syndrome.\n       * Cardiac ejection fraction ≥ 45%, no evidence of physiologically significant pericardial effusion as determined by an ECHO, and no clinically significant ECG findings\n       * No clinically significant pleural effusion\n       * Baseline oxygen saturation >92% on room air at rest\n       * creatinine: within age adjusted normal institutional limits (see table below) OR\n       * creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (as estimated by Cockcroft Gault Equation) for subjects with creatinine levels above institutional normal.\n\n    Age (Years) Maximum Serum Creatinine (mg/dL)\n\n    ≤5 0.8 5 < age ≤ 10 1.0 >10 1.2\n\n    * if these cytopenias are not judged by the investigator to be due to underlying disease (i.e. potentially reversible with anti-neoplastic therapy); A subject will not be excluded because of pancytopenia ≥ Grade 3 if it is due to disease, based on the results of bone marrow studies.\n12. CNS Status\n\n    1.

History of severe immediate hypersensitivity reaction to any of the agents used in this study.\n11. Women of child-bearing potential who are pregnant or breastfeeding because of the potentially dangerous effects of the conditioning lymphodepletion chemotherapy on the fetus or infant. Females who have undergone surgical sterilization or who have been postmenopausal for at least 2 years are not considered to be of childbearing potential.\n12. In the investigator's judgment, the subject is unlikely to complete all protocol-required study visits or procedures, including follow-up visits, or comply with the study requirements for participation.\n13.
