    "inclusion_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria for all Patients in all Modules:\n\n1. Provision of signed and dated, written informed consent form prior to any mandatory study specific procedures, sampling, and analyses\n2. Participant must be ≥18 years of age at the time of signing the inform consent form (ICF)\n3. Participants must have prostate cancer with histological or cytological confirmation\n4. Participants must have previously received and progressed on standard-of-care therapy(ies)\n5. Participants must be able to provide an archival tumor tissue sample. If archival tumor tissue is not available, then tissue from a fresh tumor biopsy is required.\n6. All participants will be required to have a site of disease that is safely accessible for biopsy (paired) upon enrollment unless there are sufficient paired samples for the analysis. Accessible lesions are defined as those which are biopsiable (at screening) and amenable to repeat biopsy (after 2 weeks of AZD4635 therapy), unless clinically contraindicated. The provision of paired biopsies will be closely monitored to ensure the desired number of biopsiable participants are enrolled and investigators are aware of this requirement at all times.\n7. Participants with measurable disease must have at least 1 documented lesion on either a bone scan or a computed tomography (CT)/ magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan that can be followed for response and is suitable for repeated measurement, or participants with non-measurable disease must have measurable PSA ≥1.0 ng/mL if the confirmed rise is the only indication of progression (excluding small cell carcinoma) 8 Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 with no clinical deterioration over the previous 2 weeks prior to the 28-day screening period and likely able to complete at least 12 weeks of treatment.\n\n9. Ability to swallow and retain oral medication. 10. Must have life expectancy of at least 12 weeks 11. Body weight ≥ 35 kg at screening 12. Willingness to adhere to the study treatment-specific contraception requirements: Participants must be surgically sterile or using an acceptable method of contraception (defined as barrier methods in conjunction with spermicides) for the duration of the study (from the time they sign ICF) and for 3 months after the last dose of AZD4635 to prevent pregnancy in a female partner.
