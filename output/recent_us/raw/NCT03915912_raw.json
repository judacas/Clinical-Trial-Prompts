High risk, locally advanced HNSCC which may include any of the following by AJCC 8th Edition:\n\n   * Stage III Hypopharyngeal Carcinoma AJCC v8\n   * Stage III Laryngeal Cancer AJCC v8\n   * Stage III Lip and Oral Cavity Cancer AJCC v8\n   * Stage III Oropharyngeal (p16-Negative) Carcinoma AJCC v8 or Stage III Oropharyngeal (p16-positive) Carcinoma ≥ 10 pack-years history of smoking\n   * Stage IVA Hypopharyngeal Carcinoma AJCC v8\n   * Stage IVA Laryngeal Cancer AJCC v8\n   * Stage IVA Lip and Oral Cavity Cancer AJCC v8\n   * Stage IVA Oropharyngeal (p16-Negative) Carcinoma AJCC v8 or Stage IVA Oropharyngeal (p16-positive) Carcinoma ≥ 10 pack-years history of smoking\n   * Stage IVB Hypopharyngeal Carcinoma AJCC v8\n   * Stage IVB Laryngeal Cancer AJCC v8\n   * Stage IVB Lip and Oral Cavity Cancer AJCC v8\n   * Stage IVB Oropharyngeal (p16-Negative) Carcinoma AJCC v8 or Stage IVB Oropharyngeal (p16-positive) Carcinoma ≥ 10 pack-years history of smoking\n7. Patient is not a candidate for definitive surgical resection\n8. Patients must have normal organ and bone marrow function measured within 28 days prior to administration of study treatment as defined below:\n\n   * Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL\n   * Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 109/L\n   * White blood cells (WBC) > 3 x 109/L\n   * Platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L\n   * Total bilirubin < 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal\n   * AST and ALT < 2.5 x institutional upper limit of normal\n9. For women of childbearing potential, a negative serum pregnancy test within 28 day screening to confirm eligibility. (Note: Pregnancy test will be repeated within 48 hours prior to the first dose of sEphB4-HAS) .\n10. ECOG performance status ≤ 2.\n11. Be deemed ineligible by a medical oncologist to receive concurrent platinum-based chemotherapy with radiotherapy or patient refusal of platinum-based chemotherapy.\n12. Be deemed eligible by a medical oncologist to receive cetuximab.\n13. Agreement to exercise appropriate use of contraception, as indicated.\n\n    * For females of reproductive potential: use of highly effective contraception from time of screening through 12 weeks following the final dose of study treatment (see section 8.5).\n    * For males of reproductive potential: use of condoms from time of screening through 12 weeks following the final dose of study treatment.\n14. Pretreatment imaging to include the following within 28 days of treatment initiation:\n\n    CT Neck (with contrast unless contraindicated) with CT chest OR PET-CT. MRI of the neck with contrast (unless contraindicated) can replace CT neck.\n\n    N.B.: a CT Neck performed for radiation planning and read by a radiologist may serve as appropriate staging and planning tools.\n15. General history and physical examination by a radiation or medical oncologist within 28 days prior to enrollment.\n16. Examination by an ENT or head and neck surgeon, including laryngopharyngoscopy (mirror and/or fiberoptic and/or direct procedure) within 56 days prior to enrollment.\n17. Dental evaluation and, if applicable, prophylaxis per NCCN guidelines performed within 84 days of treatment initiation.\n18. Eligible for definitive therapy.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 100 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Pregnant, attempting to conceive, lactating, or declining to use appropriate contraception for duration of study.\n2. Hypertension that is uncontrolled (requiring 3+ antihypertensive medications to control).\n3. Hypertension at screening (SBP ≥140mmHg or DBP ≥90mmHg, corresponding to Stage 2 according to JNC 7).\n4. Prior history of allergic or infusion reaction to cetuximab or sEphB4.\n5. Febrile illness within 7 days prior to enrollment.\n6.

Stage IVC (M1) disease per AJCC 8th edition.\n13. Prior receipt of systemic chemotherapy for the study cancer (including \"induction\" or \"neoadjuvant\" chemotherapy) within 60 days of diagnosis; prior chemotherapy for a different cancer diagnosis is allowed.\n14.
