Signed Informed Consent Form(s)\n13. Ability to comply with all the study-related procedures, in the investigator's judgement\n14. Female patients who are not of child bearing potential (i.e., who are postmenopausal or surgically sterile). For male participants: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive methods, and agree to refrain from donating sperm, as defined below: With a female partner of childbearing potential or pregnant female partners, male participants must remain abstinent or use a condom plus an additional contraceptive method that together result in a failure rate of < 1% per year during the treatment period and for at least 6 months after pretreatment with obinutuzumab, 6 months after the last dose of polatuzumab, 160 days after the last dose of rituximab, 2 months after the final dose of glofitamab or 2 months after the last dose of tocilizumab (as applicable), whichever is longer. Male participants must refrain from donating sperm during this same period. The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the individual. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not adequate methods of contraception. If required per local guidelines or regulations, locally recognized adequate methods of contraception and information about the reliability of abstinence will be described in the local Informed Consent Form.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 65 Years\nMust have maximum age of 80 Years",
