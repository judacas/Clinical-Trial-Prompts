    "exclusion_criteria": "* Patients receiving any other investigational agents are ineligible\n* Patients with a history of hypersensitivity or allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to valacyclovir, acyclovir, or temozolomide are ineligible; the valacyclovir and temozolomide package inserts can be referenced for more information\n* Patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reaction to any monoclonal antibody are ineligible\n* Patients who require therapy with systemic immunosuppressive drugs except corticosteroids are ineligible\n* Patients with a history of active autoimmune disease requiring treatment in the past 2 years are ineligible\n* Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, active liver disease or active hepatitis, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements, are ineligible\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study; breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with these agents through 1 week after receiving the last dose of study drugs\n* Patients who are known to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive are ineligible",
