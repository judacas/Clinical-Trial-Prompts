    "inclusion_criteria": "* Subjects with histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum.\n\n  * Documented RAS status (mutant or wild-type [WT]), by tissue-based analysis.\n  * Documented NOT to have microsatellite instability-high (MSI-high) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) CRC by tissue-based analysis.\n* Has received standard-of-care (SOC) anticancer therapies as prior therapy for metastatic CRC and has radiographically progressed, is refractory or intolerant to these therapies.\n\n  * Systemic SOC anticancer therapy if approved and available in the country where the subject is randomized.\n  * Radiographic progression during treatment with or within 4 months following the last dose of the most recent approved SOC chemotherapy regimen.\n* Measurable disease according to RECIST v1.1 as determined by the Investigator.\n* Available archival tumor biopsy material. If archival tissue is unavailable, must provide fresh tumor tissue biopsy prior to randomization.\n* Recovery to baseline or â‰¤ Grade 1 severity (CTCAE v5) from adverse events (AEs) related to any prior treatments, unless AE(s) are clinically nonsignificant and/or stable on supportive therapy.\n* Age 18 years or older on the day of consent.\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1.\n* Adequate organ and marrow function.\n* Fertile subjects and their partners must agree to use highly effective methods of contraception during the course of the study and after the last dose of treatment.\n* Female subjects of childbearing potential must not be pregnant at screening.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
