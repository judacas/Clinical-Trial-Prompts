    "inclusion_criteria": "* Diagnosis of colorectal adenoma of any grade\n* Age >= 18 years.

    "exclusion_criteria": "* Current (within three weeks of randomization) or planned use during the study intervention of the following:\n\n  * Aspirin, other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or COX-2 inhibitors\n  * Anticoagulants, anti-platelet agents, or corticosteroids\n  * Gingko\n  * Ethanol consumption > 1 standard drinks/day for women, or > 2 standard drinks/day for men\n  * Methotrexate (MTX)\n  * Study participants will be instructed to use Tylenol or some other non-excluded agent to treat common ailments (i.e. headache/minor aches and pains)\n* History of\n\n  * Any invasive malignancy within the past 2 years, with the exception of non-melanoma skin cancer\n  * Chronic renal diseases or liver cirrhosis\n  * Diseases such as anemia, peptic ulcer, gastrointestinal bleeding, active colitis and inflammatory bowel disease\n  * Hemorrhagic stroke or uncontrolled hypertension\n* Participants may not be receiving any other investigational agents\n* History of allergic reactions or intolerance attributed to aspirin or compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness that would limit compliance with study requirements\n* Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding; pregnant women are excluded from this study because aspirin has the potential for abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events (AEs) in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with aspirin, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with aspirin",
