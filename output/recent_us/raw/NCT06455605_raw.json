    "inclusion_criteria": "Subjects should meet all of the following inclusion criteria:\n\n1. Male or female age > / = 12 years.\n2. Recipient of a solid organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplant.\n3.

Active GI symptoms (diarrhea, or vomiting) that, in the opinion of the PI, are secondary to Norovirus. Patients must have active diarrhea, which is defined as at least 3 days of Bristol 6 or 7 stools in the past 2 weeks prior to enrollment per patient report.\n5.

    "exclusion_criteria": "Subjects meeting any of the exclusion criteria at baseline will be excluded from study participation:\n\n1. Other identified infectious causes of diarrhea at screening. Alternative diagnosis requiring treatment would be considered a co-infection; if the testing is positive for a pathogen that the PI does not feel is causing the symptoms, they may be included but the PI or his/her designee must document that the positive test is not clinically significant, does not require treatment and is not causing the symptoms making the patient eligible for enrollment.\n2. Any condition that would, in opinion of the Site Investigator, place the subject at an unacceptable risk of injury or render the subject unable to meet the requirements of the protocol.\n3. Subjects receiving oral or intravenous immunoglobulin therapy concurrently or in the 14 days prior to enrollment.\n4. Nitazoxanide use for any illness in the previous 30 days prior to randomization.\n5. Have received experimental products within 30 days prior to the study entry or plan to receive experimental products at any time during the study\n6. Known sensitivity to nitazoxanide or any of the excipients comprising the nitazoxanide tablets.\n7. Subjects unable to swallow oral medications.\n8. Subjects with ostomy.\n9.
