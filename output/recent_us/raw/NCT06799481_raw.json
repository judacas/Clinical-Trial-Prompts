    "inclusion_criteria": "* Pathologically-proven diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx or larynx. Squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary is not allowed.\n* Patients must have clinically or radiographically evident measureable disease at the primary site and/or nodal stations. Patients may undergo a diagnostic tonsillectomy, and diagnostic lymph node excision (< 2 nodes) is also allowable.\n* Clinical stage I-IVB (AJCC, 7th edition); stages I-II glottic cancer are excluded\n* Age ≥ 18 years.\n* ECOG Performance Status 0-2\n* Adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:\n* leukocytes ≥ 3,000/mcL\n* absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcL\n* platelets ≥ 100,000/mcl\n* total bilirubin within normal institutional limits\n* AST(SGOT)/ALT(SPGT) ≤ 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal\n* Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for 90 days following completion of therapy. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.\n\n  * A female of child-bearing potential is any woman (regardless of sexual orientation, having undergone a tubal ligation, or remaining celibate by choice) who meets the following criteria:\n\n    * Has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or\n    * Has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months).\n* Negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 2 weeks before registration for women of childbearing potential.\n* Neck CT and/or neck MRI, and whole body PET-CT.\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 99 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Distant metastasis or adenopathy below the clavicles.\n* Inability to undergo PET-CT.\n* Stage I and II glottic carcinoma.\n* Gross total excision of both the primary and nodal disease.\n* Synchronous primaries outside of the oropharynx and larynx.\n* Prior invasive malignancy (except non-melanomatous skin cancer) unless disease-free for a minimum of 1 years\n* Prior systemic chemotherapy for the study cancer; prior chemotherapy for a remote cancer is allowable\n* Prior radiotherapy to the region of the study cancer that would result in overlap of radiation fields.\n* Subjects may not be receiving any other investigational agents.\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to the chemotherapy agents in this study (if necessary).\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* Subjects must not be pregnant or nursing due to the potential for congenital abnormalities and the potential of this regimen to harm nursing infants.\n* History of immunosuppression or autoimmunity, including HIV, and organ or stem cell transplant, or an autoimmune condition previously treated with immunosuppressive therapy",
