    "exclusion_criteria": "* Systemic Illness: Patients with any clinically significant unrelated systemic illness (serious infections or significant cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic or other organ dysfunction), that in the opinion of the investigator would compromise the patient's ability to tolerate protocol therapy, put them at additional risk for toxicity or would interfere with the study procedures or results.\n* Other Malignancy: Patients with a history of any other malignancy.\n* Concurrent Therapy: Patients who are receiving any other anticancer or investigational drug therapy are not eligible.\n* Inability to Participate: Patients who in the opinion of the investigator are unwilling or unable to return for required follow-up visits or obtain follow-up studies required to assess toxicity to therapy or to adhere to device usage plan, other study procedures, and study restrictions.\n* Stratum 1 Tumor Location: Patients with primarily infra-tentorial or spinal cord tumor are not eligible.\n* Tumor Dissemination: Patients for who clinical suspicion is present of metastatic disease in the CSF or Spine must have MRI of Spine and CSF obtained (Lumbar puncture or through ommaya, EVD or Shunt) with negative cytology. Patients with CSF that is positive for tumor cells or metastatic disease found on MRI are ineligible.\n* Skull Defects: Patients with major skull defects (such as missing bone without replacement) are not eligible.\n* Neurological Disorder: Patients with active implanted electronic devices in the brain or spinal cord such as programmable VP shunts, deep brain stimulators, vagus nerve stimulators, are not eligible.\n* Cardiac Disorder: Patients with pacemaker, defibrillator, or documented significant arrhythmia, are not allowed.\n* Intracranial Objects: Patients with foreign body intracranially, such as bullet fragments, are not allowed, with the exception of VP-shunts (non-programmable) and Ommaya catheters.\n* Allergy: Patients with history of hypersensitivity to conductive hydrogel are not eligible.",
