Patients must have persistent/refractory or relapsed disease for which standard curative measures are no longer effective, as defined in the protocol\n   4. Patients must have evaluable or measurable disease per the revised International Neuroblastoma Response Criteria (INRC)\n3. Adequate washout from prior treatment regimens\n4. Adequate organ function\n5. Adequate performance status defined as Lansky or Karnofsky performance score ≥50%\n6.

Patients who have received prior CART-cell or other gene-modified immune-effector cell therapy, are not eligible unless they are >8 weeks from time of infusion, have fully recovered from any associated toxicities and have documented lack of persistence of the product\n5. Patients with a known additional malignancy other than non-melanomatous skin cancer or carcinoma in situ, unless not requiring active treatment and stable or disease-free for at least 3 years\n6. Uncontrolled CNS metastasis\n7. CNS disorder such as cerebrovascular ischemia/hemorrhage, dementia, cerebellar disease, or autoimmune disease with CNS involvement which may impair the ability to evaluate neurotoxicity\n8.
