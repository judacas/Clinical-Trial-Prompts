    "exclusion_criteria": "* Previous radiotherapy to the intended treatment site that precludes developing a treatment plan that respects normal tissue tolerances.\n* Serious medical co-morbidities precluding radiotherapy.\n* Pregnant or breast-feeding women.\n* Lesions excluded from de-escalation include regions in which the risk of local disease progression is unacceptably high, including CNS disease and cord compression, and areas in which re-irradiation would not be feasible, including spinal cord overlap.",
