The ability to communicate during the screening process (e.g., no aphasia or other severe language impairment).\n3. Meet DSM-5 criteria for insomnia disorder assessed by Duke Structured Interview for Sleep Disorders.\n4.

    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Evidence of recent severe mental health disorders (e.g., suicide attempt or psychiatric hospitalization in the past year).\n2. Presence of psychotic disorder, substance abuse or dependence, or bipolar disorder assessed by MINI International Neuropsychiatric Inventory (to increase generalizability other psychiatric comorbidities such as depression or anxiety will not be excluded).\n3. Untreated comorbid sleep disorders based on structured diagnostic interview including: narcolepsy, periodic leg movement disorder, and/or obstructive sleep apnea risk.\n4. Cognitive impairment defined as <20 on the Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE) that could potentially limit comprehension of the intervention. Note, while an MMSE of <24 is often used as a cutoff for cognitive impairment, we do not wish to exclude those with mild cognitive problems from this study as there is evidence that individuals with mild cognitive problems still benefit from insomnia treatments.",
