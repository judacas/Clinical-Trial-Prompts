    "official_title": "Randomized Prospective Trial of Breast Cancer Locator Guided vs. Wire Localized Partial Mastectomy for Breast Cancer",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Female gender\n* Age > 18 years\n* Histologic diagnosis of invasive breast cancer or DCIS\n* The surgeon determines that pre-operative tumor localization is required because the tumor cannot be definitively detected by palpation\n* The tumor is unifocal or multifocal with satellite lesions < or = 2 cm from primary tumor\n* The tumor enhances on prone breast MRI imaging\n* The tumor is â‰¥ 1 cm in diameter on prone breast MRI\n* Subject and surgeon agree to perform BCS\n* Subject voluntarily provides informed consent\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be FEMALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Absolute contraindication to MRI, including presence of implanted electrical device (e.g., pacemaker or neurostimulator), aneurysm clip, or metallic foreign body in or near eyes\n* Severe claustrophobia that precludes prone or supine MRI\n* Contraindication to use of gadolinium-based intravenous contrast, including life- threatening allergy\n* Compromised renal function including chronic, severe kidney disease (GFR < 30 ml/min/1.73m2), or acute kidney injury\n* Pregnancy - In women of childbearing potential, a urine pregnancy test will be performed\n* Subjects who have received or plan to receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy\n* Sternal notch to nipple distance of > 32 cm as measured in a sitting or standing position\n* Measurement of widest circumference around breasts and arms > 135 cm for sites using 60cm bore scanners, and measurement of widest circumference around breasts and arms >145 cm for sites using 70 cm bore scanners\n* Subjects with known allergy to materials present in the device\n* Use of localization with devices other than a localization wire, including intraoperative ultrasound guidance, radiofrequency emitting implants, magnetic seeds, radioactive seeds, and tissue inspection devices (MarginProbe)\n* Subject would require > 2 localization wires, if randomized to standard of care\n* Subjects with multicentric tumors (additional tumors > 2 cm from primary)\n* Subject would require chest wall muscle nerve block as part of the operation",
