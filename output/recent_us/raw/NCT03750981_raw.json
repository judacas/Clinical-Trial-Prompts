Subjects should have recovered from previous treatment toxicity (except hair loss and peripheral neuropathy).\n* History of uncontrolled brain metastasis.\n* Subject has received extended field radiotherapy ≤4 weeks before the start of treatment (≤2 weeks for limited field radiation to alleviate symptoms), and who has not recovered from related side effects of such therapy (except for hair loss).\n* Subjects who have previously experienced an immune-related adverse event (irAE) to pembrolizumab, for which permanent discontinuation is required. Subjects without a formal contraindication due to previous irAE are not eligible if the AE has not resolved or requires steroids (>10 mg prednisone-equivalent per day) for ongoing management.\n* Subjects with active severe infection requiring oral antibiotics.\n* Clinical evidence of an active second invasive malignancy with the exception of stable prostate cancer on watchful waiting.\n* Uncontrolled or significant cardiovascular disease.\n* History of autoimmune disease requiring systemic immunosuppressive therapy (daily prednisone equivalent doses >10 mg/day).\n* HIV patients can be enrolled if the infection is adequately controlled.\n* Known bleeding disorder or coagulopathy. Subjects on stable anticoagulant therapy are allowed.\n* Known or suspected allergy to study treatment or related products.\n* Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding, or trying to become pregnant.\n* Patients with chronic viral hepatitis.\n\nExclusion criteria (Part 2):\n\n* Previous therapy with immunotherapy (anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, and anti-PD-L2, anti-CTLA-4, or other approved or investigational checkpoint-inhibitors).\n* Subject is unable or unwilling to take folic acid or vitamin B12 supplementation.\n* Subject is unable to interrupt aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), other than an aspirin dose ≤ 1.3 g per day, for a 5-day period (8-day period for long-acting agents, such as piroxicam).\n\nOther protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
