Albumin >= 2.5 mg/dL.\n   8. International normalized ratio (INR) or prothrombin time (PT) =< 1.5 x ULN unless subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants.\n   9. Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) =< 1.5 x ULN unless subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or aPTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants (within 10 days of treatment initiation)\n10. Negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication (day 1) (female participants of childbearing potential). If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required\n11. Male and female participants of childbearing potential must be willing to use an adequate method of contraception* for the course of the study through 120 days after the last dose of study medication. * Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and preferred contraception for the subject\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",

Currently participating in or has participated in a study of an investigational agent or has used an investigational device within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment.\n\n   * Note: Participants who have entered the follow-up phase of an investigational study may participate as long as it has been 4 weeks since the last dose of the previous investigational agent\n6. Diagnosis of immunodeficiency or receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy (in dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment.\n7. Known history of active Bacillus tuberculosis (TB).\n8. Severe hypersensitivity (>= grade 3) to pembrolizumab/axitinib or any of their excipients.\n9.

Participants with =< grade 2 neuropathy may be eligible.\n   * Note: If subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting study treatment.\n   * Participants must have recovered from all radiation-related toxicities, not require corticosteroids, and not have had radiation pneumonitis. A 1-week washout is permitted for palliative radiation (=< 2 weeks of radiotherapy) to non-central nervous system (CNS) disease.\n10.

Participants with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are radiologically stable, i.e., without evidence of progression for at least 4 weeks by repeat imaging (note that the repeat imaging should be performed during study screening), clinically stable and without requirement of steroid treatment for at least 14 days prior to first dose of study treatment. This exception does not include carcinomatous meningitis, which is excluded regardless of clinical stability.\n12. Active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e., with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment and is allowed.\n13.

Any prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1,or anti-PD-L2 agent or with an agent directed to another stimulatory or co-inhibitory T cell receptor (e.g., cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), OX-40, CD137).\n22. Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. No HIV testing is required unless mandated by local health authority.\n23.

No testing for hepatitis B and hepatitis C is required unless mandated by local health authority.\n24. Live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug. Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster (chicken pox), yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., FluMist) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.\n25.
