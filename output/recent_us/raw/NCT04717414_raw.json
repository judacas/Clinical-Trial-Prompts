Non-English speaking patients are eligible.\n* Karnofsky performance status 70 (Appendix A.).\n* Adequate organ function (Please see Table 2. below). Participant agrees to not donate blood while taking lenalidomide and for 28 days after stopping lenalidomide.\n* Patient agrees to enroll in the lenalidomide REMS program.\n* Woman of child-bearing potential (WOCPB) must abstain from hetersosexual sexual contact or agrees to use a contraceptive method that is highly effective (with a failure rate of <1% per year), preferably with low user dependency (as described in Appendix C), plus one additional effective method at least 28 days before starting therapy (for lenalidomide), during the intervention period, at least 28 days after the last dose of lenalidomide and at least 4 months after the last dose of belantamab mafodotin, and agrees not to donate eggs (ova, oocytes) for reproduction during this period. The investigator should evaluate the effectiveness of the contraceptive method in relation to the first dose of the study intervention.\n\nA WOCBP must have a negative highly sensitive serum pregnancy test (as required by local regulations) within 10-14 days and also within 24 hours before the first dose of the study intervention.\n\nNonchildbearing potential is defined as follows (by other than medical reasons):\n\n* ≥ 45 years of age and has not had menses for >1 year.\n* Patients who have been amenorrhoeic for <2 years without a history of a hysterectomy and oophorectomy must have a follicle-stimulating hormone value in the postmenopausal range upon screening evaluation.\n* Post-hysterectomy, post-bilateral oophorectomy, or post-tubal ligation. 9. Male participant agrees to contraceptive use that should be consistent with institutional guidelines regarding the methods of contraception for those participating in clinical studies.\n\nMale participants are eligible to participate if they agree to the following during the intervention period and for 6 months after the last dose of study treatment to allow for clearance of any altered sperm:\n\n• Refrain from donating sperm during treatment (including dose interruptions) and for 4 weeks after their last dose of lenalidomide.\n\nPLUS, either:\n\n• Be abstinent from heterosexual intercourse as their preferred and usual lifestyle (abstinent on a long term and persistent basis) and agree to remain abstinent.\n\nOR Must agree to use contraception/barrier as detailed in Appendix C.\n\n• All prior auto-HCT- related toxicities (defined by National Cancer Institute - Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE), version 5 must be ≤ Grade 1 at the time of enrollment except for alopecia, fatigue, and amenorrhea.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* History of progressive disease at any time before starting maintenance.\n* Patients with smoldering MM (IMWG criteria, Appendix F.).\n* Patients with plasma cell leukemia.\n* Patients with non-secretory MM (no measurable disease on electrophoresis and immunofixation).

Note: Stable non-cirrhotic chronic liver disease (including Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones) or hepatobiliary involvement of malignancy is acceptable if otherwise meets entry criteria\n* Participant must not have presence of active renal condition (infection, requirement for dialysis or any other condition that could affect participant's safety). Participants with isolated proteinuria resulting from MM are eligible, provided they fulfil inclusion criteria.\n* Current corneal or epithelial disease (except mild punctate keratopathy; see Appendix E.).\n* Participant must not use contact lenses while participating in this study.\n* Participant must not have used an investigational drug or approved systemic anti-myeloma therapy (including systemic steroids) within 14 days or five half-lives, whichever is shorter, preceding the first dose of study drug.\n* Participant must not have received prior treatment with a monoclonal antibody within 30 days of receiving the first dose of study drugs.\n* Participant must not have had major surgery ≤ 4 weeks before initiating study treatment.\n* The participant must not have any evidence of active mucosal or internal bleeding.\n* Participant must not have known immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reaction or idiosyncratic reactions to belantamab mafodotin or drugs chemically related to belantamab mafodotin, or any of the components of the study treatment.\n* Participant must not have an active infection requiring treatment.\n* Participant must not have evidence of cardiovascular risk, including any of the following:\n\n  1. Evidence of current clinically significant uncontrolled arrhythmias, including clinically significant ECG abnormalities such as 2nd degree (Mobitz Type II) or 3rd degree atrioventricular (AV) block.\n  2. History of myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndromes (including unstable angina), coronary angioplasty, or stenting or bypass grafting within three (3) months of screening.\n  3.
