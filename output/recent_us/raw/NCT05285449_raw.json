Subjects with hemoglobin values at the screening visit equal to or greater than 12.0 g/dL.\n7. Subjects with a platelet count of at least 100 x10^9 at the screening visit.\n8. Subjects with an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of equal to or higher than 0.5 x10^9 at the screening visit.\n9. Subject who are willing to undergo a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy and CT scan for disease burden assessment.\n10. Patient who are capable to return to MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) for follow-up\n11. Subjects with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1 or 2\n12.

Subjects with inadequate liver or renal function at screening and baseline visits: A) Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) > 2.5x Upper limit of normal (ULN). B) Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) calculated GFR < 30 mL/min\n5. Subjects with active uncontrolled infection or who are HIV positive (Subjects with acute infections requiring treatment should delay screening/enrollment until the course of therapy has been completed and the event is considered controlled).\n6.
