    "official_title": "An Open-Label, Phase 2, Parallel Arm Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Activity of TAK-931 Single Agent in Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer, Metastatic Colorectal Cancer, and Other Advanced Solid Tumors",
    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Adult male or female participants aged >=20 years (Japan) or >=18 years (United States).\n2. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1\n3. Has pathologically confirmed metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma that has progressed after, at least, a first line of standard systemic chemotherapy for the metastatic disease, OR participants with pathologically confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum who have progressed to at least 2 lines of standard systemic chemotherapy for the metastatic disease, OR participants with pathologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic sqEC that has progressed after at least a first line of standard systemic therapy for metastatic disease. First-line participants can be enrolled if a platinum doublet is contraindicated or refused by the participants, OR pathologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic sqNSCLC that has progressed after at least 2 lines of standard systemic therapy for metastatic disease.\n4. For the Western safety cohort only: participants with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumor for whom no standard treatment with an established survival benefit is available or if the participant refuses other standard therapy.\n5. For disease-specific cohort participants: measurable disease per RECIST v. 1.1\n6. Left ventricular ejection fraction greater than (>) 50% as measured by ECHO or MUGA scan within 4 weeks before receiving the first dose of study drug.\n7. Recovered to Grade 1 or baseline from all toxic effects of previous therapy (except alopecia or neuropathy).\n8. Suitable venous access for the study-required blood sampling.\n9. For the Western safety cohort only: willingness to undergo serial skin tissue biopsies.\n10. For disease-specific cohort participants: Must have an archival (banked) tumor sample or agree to have a new (fresh) tumor biopsy during the screening period. If a new tumor sample is needed, the disease should be accessible for a nonsignificant risk biopsy procedure (those occurring outside the brain, lung/mediastinum, and pancreas, or obtained with endoscopic procedures not extending beyond the stomach or bowel). For participants in the Western safety cohort, this biopsy is optional.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Participants who require continuous use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or histamine-2 (H2) receptor antagonists and participants who are taking PPIs within 5 days before the first dose of study drug.\n2. Treatment with clinically significant enzyme inducers, such as phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine, or Saint John's wort within 14 days before the first dose of study drug.\n3. Treatment with any systemic anticancer treatment (including investigational products) within 30 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter, before the first dose of study drug.\n4. History of any of the following within the last 3 months before administration of the first dose of study drug:\n\n   * Ischemic myocardial event including angina requiring therapy and artery revascularization procedures, myocardial infarction, and unstable symptomatic ischemic heart disease.\n   * Ischemic cerebrovascular event, including transient ischemic attack and artery, revascularization procedures.\n   * Significant, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia (including atrial flutter/fibrillation, ventricular fibrillation, or ventricular tachycardia).\n   * New York Heart Association Class III to IV heart failure.\n   * Any other cardiac condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, could pose an additional risk for participation in the study (example, pericardial effusion or restrictive cardiomyopathy).\n   * Baseline prolongation of the QT interval corrected for heart rate (HR) using Fridericia's formula [QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia's formula (QTcF); example, repeated demonstration of QTcF interval >480 millisecond (ms), history of congenital long QT syndrome, or torsades de pointes].\n5. Hypertension that is unstable or not controlled by medication.\n6. History of uncontrolled brain metastasis unless:\n\n   * Previously treated with surgery, whole-brain radiation, or stereotactic radiosurgery, and\n   * Stable disease (SD) for >=30 days, without steroid use (or stable steroid dose established for >=14 days before the first dose of TAK-931).\n7. Known history of human immunodeficiency virus infection.\n8. Known hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen seropositive or detectable hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection viral load. Note: Participants who have positive HBV core antibody or HBV surface antigen antibody can be enrolled but must have an undetectable HBV viral load.\n9. Prior treatment with radiation therapy involving >=25% of the hematopoietically active bone marrow within 3 months before the first dose of study drug.\n10. Participants with known microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) genotype or known wild type tumor protein 53 (TP53) per local testing.\n11. Western Safety Cohort Only: Participants with Japanese heredity.",
