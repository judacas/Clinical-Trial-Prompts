    "inclusion_criteria": "* Pathologically (histologically or cytologically) proven diagnosis of HER2-positive OR HER2-low expressing recurrent/metastatic salivary gland cancer (SGC)\n\n  * HER2-positive cohort:\n\n    * Note: The majority of HER2-positive SGCs are salivary duct carcinoma (SDCs), but to a lesser extent, other SGC subtypes can be HER2-positive (e.g., adenocarcinomas, mucoepidermoid carcinomas, etc.) and are eligible to be included on the study. Additionally, pathologists may sign out SDCs under other descriptors (e.g., ex-pleomorphic adenoma, adenocarcinoma), and these would be eligible if they are HER2-positive.\n    * Note: HER2 evaluation based on local site immunohistochemistry (IHC), fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH), or local/commercial next-generation sequencing (NGS) is required.

For patients with HCV infection who are currently on treatment, they are eligible if they have an undetectable HCV viral load\n\n  * Note: Known positive test for hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA) indicating acute or chronic infection would make the patient ineligible unless the viral load becomes undetectable on suppressive therapy\n* Negative urine or serum pregnancy test (in persons of childbearing potential) within 14 days prior to registration.
