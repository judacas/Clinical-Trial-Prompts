    "inclusion_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria\n\nA potential subject must meet all the following inclusion criteria to be eligible to participate in the study:\n\n* Male or female patients aged > or = 12 years old\n* ECOG Performance Status of < or = 2\n* Any patient with the diagnosis of locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS) who have progressed on at least 1 prior line of therapy. Prior immunotherapy treatment is allowed.\n* Patients with no known CNS disease, except for treated brain metastasis. Treated brain metastases are defined as having no evidence of progression or hemorrhage after treatment and no ongoing treatment for dexamethasone (as ascertained by clinical examination and brain imaging) during the screening period. Stable dose of anticonvulsants is allowed. Treatment for brain metastases may include whole brain radiotherapy, radiosurgery, or a combination as deemed appropriate by the treating physician.
