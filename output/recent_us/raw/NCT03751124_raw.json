Pregnant people are excluded from this study because XL092 is a next-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor with potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the nursing parent with XL092, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the nursing parent is treated with XL092. Note: If a urine pregnancy test is positive or cannot be confirmed negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required\n* Patients with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements, per the opinion of the treating investigator\n* XL092 is administrated orally; patients who are unable to swallow, retain, and/or absorb pills are not eligible for this study\n* Patients who are currently participating in or have participated in a study of an investigational agent or have used an investigational device within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of treatment\n* Other conditions which, in the opinion of the Investigator, would compromise the safety of the patient or the patient's ability to complete the study",
