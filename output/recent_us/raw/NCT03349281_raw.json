The biopsy should be a core biopsy, a punch biopsy, an excisional biopsy, or a surgical specimen. Fine needle aspiration is unacceptable for submission\n\n   * For Phase I participants: Pretreatment tissue must be available through either an archival sample obtained within at most 6 months and submitted as an FFPE tissue block or 30 unstained tumor tissue slides or a fresh pretreatment biopsy. Subsequent tumor biopsies will be optional.\n   * For Phase IIa participants: Either an archival sample submitted as an FFPE tissue block or unstained tumor tissue slides or a fresh pretreatment biopsy from safely biopsiable lesion. Note that if the patient has archival tissue available from a biopsy within 90 days of C1D1 and there has been no systemic treatment since that time then that tissue can be used in place of a fresh pre-treatment biopsy. Patients must also agree to undergo post treatment, cycle 2, tumor biopsies for research purposes. Subsequent biopsies will be optional.\n7.

NOTE: This table includes eligibility-defining laboratory value requirements for treatment; laboratory value requirements should be adapted according to local regulations and guidelines for the administration of specific chemotherapies.\n10. Women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) must not be breastfeeding and must have a negative pregnancy test within 3 days prior to initiation of dosing. She must agree to use an acceptable method of birth control from the time of the negative pregnancy test, through the duration of treatment with the study combination plus 5 half-lives of study treatment for a total of 5 months post -treatment completion. WOCBP must agree to adhere to the contraceptive guidance in Appendix 4. NOTE: A female participant is eligible to participate if she is not a woman of childbearing potential as defined Appendix 4.\n11. All associated toxicity from previous or concurrent cancer therapy must be resolved (to ≤ grade 1 or baseline) prior to study treatment administration. This excludes low grade or non-serious toxicities. However, stable endocrinopathies requiring replacement therapy will be allowed.\n12. Steroids for physiological replacement are allowed as long as it does not exceed 10 mg/day prednisone equivalents.\n13. Participants must have known BRAF V600 mutation status or consent to BRAF V600 mutation testing per local institutional standards during the screening period. BRAF V600 results need not be available at the time of study start.\n14. Participants with asymptomatic brain metastases are eligible. There must also be no requirement for immunosuppressive doses of systemic corticosteroids (> 10 mg/day prednisone equivalents) for at least 10 days prior to study treatment administration. Patients with brain metastases treated with SRS will be allowed, as long as last radiation therapy is >1 week.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Patients with ocular melanoma.\n2. Patients with symptomatic CNS metastases and/or requiring corticosteroid treatment.\n3. History of known leptomeningeal involvement (lumbar puncture not required).\n4. Patients who experienced Grade 3/4 immune-related adverse events with checkpoint inhibitor therapy, except those that are unlikely to re-occur with standard countermeasures (e.g. hypothyroidism) 5. Subjects with an active, known or suspected autoimmune disease. Subjects with type I diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism only requiring hormone replacement, skin disorders (such as vitiligo, psoriasis, or alopecia) not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger are permitted to enroll.\n\n6. Subjects with major medical, neurologic or psychiatric condition who are judged as unable to fully comply with study therapy or assessments should not be enrolled.\n\n7. Subject has a history of a second malignancy, unless potentially curative treatment has been completed with no evidence of malignancy for 2 years.

Subjects with a completely treated prior malignancy and no evidence of disease for ≥ 2 years are eligible.\n\na. Skin Cancer Exclusion: Please note that basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma is exempt from needing resection prior to treatment. (Resection can be completed after the start of treatment).\n\n8. History of or is positive for hepatitis B (hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] reactive) or hepatitis C (hepatitis C virus [HCV] RNA [qualitative] is detected).\n\na. NOTE: Without known history, testing needs to be performed to determine eligibility. Hepatitis C antibody (Ab) testing is allowed for screening purposes in countries where HCV RNA is not part of standard of care.\n\n9. History of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. No HIV testing is required unless mandated by local health authority.\n\n10. The use of corticosteroids is not allowed for 14 days prior to initiation of therapy (based upon 5 times the expected half-life of dexamethasone) except patients who are taking steroids for physiological replacement or in the case of Inhaled or topical steroids or other immunosuppressive medications. If alternative corticosteroid therapy has been used, consultation with the PI is required to determine the washout period prior to initiating study treatment.\n\n11. Major surgical procedure, open biopsy (excluding skin cancer resection), or significant traumatic injury within 14 days of initiating study drug (unless the wound has healed) or anticipation of the need for major surgery during the study.\n\n12.

Also, • prior myocarditis of any etiology. • Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) assessment with documented LVEF < 50% by either transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) or multigated acquisition scan (TTE preferred test) within 6 months prior to the start of study treatment.\n\n16. Troponin T (TnT) or I (TnI) > 2 × institutional ULN. Participants with TnT or TnI levels between > 1 to 2 × ULN will be permitted if repeat levels within 24 hours are ≤ 1 ULN. If TnT or TnI levels are between >1 to 2 × ULN within 24 hours, the participant may undergo a cardiac consultation and be considered for treatment, following cardiologist recommendation. When repeat levels within 24 hours are not available, a repeat test should be conducted as soon as possible. If TnT or TnI repeat levels beyond 24 hours are < 2 × ULN, the participant may undergo a cardiac consultation and be considered for treatment, following cardiologist recommendation. Notification of the decision to enroll the participant following cardiologist recommendation has to be made to the principal investigator.\n\n17.
