Written informed consent in accordance with federal, local, and institutional guidelines.\n7. Age ≥18 years.\n8. Resolution of any clinically significant non-hematological toxicities (if any) from previous treatments to ≤ Grade 1 by C1D1.

Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) normal to <2 × ULN.\n10. Adequate renal function within 28 days prior to C1D1 (estimated creatinine clearance [CrCl] of ≥20 mL/min, calculated using the formula of Cockroft and Gault):\n\n(140-Age) × Mass (kg)/(72 × creatinine mg/dL) Multiply by 0.85 if the patient is female, or if CrCl is ≥20 mL/min as measured by 24-hour urine collection.\n\n11. Adequate hematopoietic function within 7 days prior to C1D1: total white blood cell (WBC) count ≥1500/mm3, absolute neutrophil count ≥1000/mm3, hemoglobin ≥8.5 g/dL and platelet count ≥75,000/mm3 (patients for whom < 50% of bone marrow nucleated cells are plasma cells) or ≥50,000/mm3 (patients for whom ≥50% of bone marrow nucleated cells are plasma cells).\n\n1. Patients receiving hematopoietic growth factor support, including erythropoietin, darbepoetin, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and platelet stimulators (eg, eltrombopag, romiplostim, or interleukin-11) must have a 2-week interval between growth factor support and the Screening assessments, but they may receive growth factor support during the study.\n2. Patients must have:\n\n   * At least a 2-week interval from the last red blood cell (RBC) transfusion prior to the Screening hemoglobin assessment, and\n   * At least a 1-week interval from the last platelet transfusion prior to the Screening platelet assessment.\n\nHowever, patients may receive RBC and/or platelet transfusions as clinically indicated per institutional guidelines during the study.\n\n12. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at Screening. Female patients of childbearing potential and fertile male patients who are sexually active with a female of childbearing potential must use highly effective methods of contraception throughout the study and for 3 months following the last dose of study treatment.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Prior exposure to a SINE compound (i.e. an XPO-1 inhibitor), including selinexor.\n2.

Cancer treated with curative intent for >5 years previously and without evidence of recurrence will be allowed.\n3. Has any concurrent medical condition or disease (e.g., uncontrolled active hypertension, uncontrolled active diabetes, active systemic infection, etc.) that is likely to interfere with study procedures.\n4. Uncontrolled active infection requiring parenteral antibiotics, antivirals, or antifungals within 1 week prior to C1D1. Patients on prophylactic antibiotics or with a controlled infection within 1 week prior to C1D1 are acceptable.\n5. Active plasma cell leukemia.\n6. Documented systemic light chain amyloidosis.\n7.
