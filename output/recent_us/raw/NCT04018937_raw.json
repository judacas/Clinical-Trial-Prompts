    "exclusion_criteria": "* Rectal cancer histology other than adenocarcinoma (i.e., sarcoma, lymphoma, squamous cell carcinoma, mucosal melanoma, etc.)\n* Definitive clinical or radiologic evidence of metastatic disease; required imaging studies must have been performed within 28 days prior to randomization; Note: Distant clinical staging to exclude patients with overt metastatic disease is determined by:\n\n  * Chest: CT scan (preferred); chest x-ray posterioranterior (PA) and lateral (acceptable); or positron emission tomography (PET) scan (acceptable)\n  * Abdomen: CT scan with IV contrast (preferred); or MRI (acceptable)\n  * Pelvis: MRI (preferred) or CT scan with IV contrast (acceptable)\n\n    * (It is recommended that the same imaging tests that are performed before randomization be used at follow-up time points; Note: CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis must be performed with IV contrast)\n* History of prior invasive rectal malignancy, regardless of disease-free interval\n* Cardiac disease that would preclude the use of any of the drugs included in the GI002 treatment regimen; this includes but is not limited to:\n\n  * Clinically unstable cardiac disease, including unstable atrial fibrillation, symptomatic bradycardia, unstable congestive heart failure, active myocardial ischemia, or indwelling temporary pacemaker\n  * Ventricular tachycardia or supraventricular tachycardia that requires treatment with class Ia antiarrhythmic drugs (e.g., quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide) or class III antiarrhythmic drug (e.g., sotalol, amiodarone, dofetilide); use of other antiarrhythmic drugs is permitted\n  * Second- or third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block unless treated with a permanent pacemaker\n  * Complete left bundle branch block (LBBB)\n  * History of long QT syndrome\n  * Corrected QT (QTc) >= 450 ms\n* Sensory or motor neuropathy >= grade 2\n* History of, or any evidence of active, non-infectious pneumonitis\n* Active inflammatory bowel disease (i.e., patients requiring current medical interventions or who are symptomatic) or have a history of abdominal surgery or other medical condition that may, in the opinion of the treating physician, interfere with gastrointestinal motility or absorption\n* Active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment within the past 2 years (i.e., with use of modifying agents, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive drugs); replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment\n* History of active TB (Bacillus tuberculosis)\n* Active or chronic infection requiring systemic therapy\n* Diagnosis of immunodeficiency or receiving systemic steroid therapy or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of study therapy; the use of physiologic doses of corticosteroids may be approved after consultation with the study principal investigator (PI)\n* Active seizure disorder uncontrolled by medication\n* Any antineoplastic therapy for this cancer before randomization\n* Synchronous colon cancer\n* Other invasive cancer within 5 years before randomization; exceptions are colonic polyps, non-melanoma skin cancer or carcinoma-in-situ of the cervix\n* Antineoplastic therapy (e.g. chemotherapy or targeted therapy) for other invasive cancer within 5 years before randomization; (for the purposes of this study, hormonal therapy is not considered chemotherapy)\n* Prior treatment with an investigational compound being tested in this study (e.g., poly ADP ribose polymerase [PARP] inhibitor, anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2)\n* Receipt of live vaccination within 28 days before randomization; seasonal flu vaccines that do not contain live virus are permitted\n* Major surgery within 4 weeks before randomization\n* Any therapeutic pelvic radiation\n* Known homozygous DPD (dihydro pyrimidine dehydrogenase) deficiency\n* Any of the following because this study involves agents that have known or potential genotoxic or mutagenic, and teratogenic effects:\n\n  * Pregnant women\n  * Nursing women who are unwilling to discontinue nursing\n  * Men or women of childbearing potential who are unwilling to employ adequate contraception (e.g., hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) for the duration of study treatment and for 4 months after the last dose of study therapy\n* Co-morbid illnesses or other concurrent disease that, in the judgement of the clinician obtaining informed consent, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study or interfere significantly with the proper assessment of safety and toxicity of the prescribed regimens or prevent required follow-up",
