    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia.\n2. Active severe infection not well controlled by antibacterial or antiviral therapy.\n3. Known infection with human immunodeficiency virus.\n4. Patients with documented pulmonary disease, with a diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO) and/or forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) <65%, or history of dyspnea at rest, or requiring oxygen.\n5. Pregnant or breast feeding women.\n6. Prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 14 days of study entry unless fully recovered from adverse effects due to treatment, at investigator's discretion.\n7.
