    "official_title": "An Open-label, Single-arm, Multicenter Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Caplacizumab and Immunosuppressive Therapy Without Firstline Therapeutic Plasma Exchange in Adults With Immune-mediated Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura",
    "inclusion_criteria": "Participants with a clinical diagnosis of iTTP (initial or recurrent), which includes thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (eg, presence of schistocytes in peripheral blood smear) and relatively preserved renal function. The iTTP diagnosis should be confirmed by ADAMTS13 testing within 48 hours (2 days).\n\nParticipants with a clinical diagnosis of iTTP and a French TMA score of 1 or 2.\n\nA female participant is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant or breastfeeding, and one of the following conditions applies:\n\n* Is a woman of nonchildbearing potential (WONCBP), OR\n* Is a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) and agrees to use an acceptable contraceptive method during the overall treatment period and for at least 2 months after the last study drug administration.\n\nMale participants with female partners of childbearing potential must agree to follow the contraceptive guidance as per protocol during the overall treatment period and for at least 2 months after last study drug administration.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 80 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "Platelet count ≥100 x 10^9/L. Serum creatinine level >2.26 mg/dL (200 µmol/L) in case platelet count is >30 x 10^9/L (to exclude possible cases of atypical HUS).\n\nKnown other causes of thrombocytopenia including but not limited to:\n\n* Clinical evidence of enteric infection with E. coli 0157 or related organism.\n* Atypical HUS.\n* Hematopoietic stem cell, bone marrow or solid organ transplantation-associated thrombotic microangiopathy.\n* Known or suspected sepsis.\n* Diagnosis of disseminated intravascular coagulation. Congenital TTP (known at the time of study entry). Clinically significant active bleeding or known co-morbidities associated with high risk of bleeding (excluding thrombocytopenia).\n\nInherited or acquired coagulation disorders. Malignant arterial hypertension. Participants requiring or expected to require invasive procedures immediately (eg, stroke requiring thrombolytic therapy, those who need mechanical ventilation, etc.).\n\nThose presenting with severe neurological or cardiac disease. Clinical condition other than that associated with TTP, with life expectancy <6 months, such as end-stage malignancy.\n\nKnown chronic treatment with anticoagulants and anti-platelet drugs that cannot be stopped (interrupted) safely, including but not limited to:\n\n* vitamin K antagonists.\n* direct-acting oral anticoagulants.\n* heparin or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH).\n* non-steroidal anti-inflammatory molecules other than acetyl salicylic acid. Participants who were previously enrolled in this clinical study (study EFC16521).\n\nParticipants who received an investigational drug, or device, other than caplacizumab, within 30 days of anticipated IMP administration or 5 half-lives of the previous investigational drug, whichever is longer.\n\nPositive result on COVID test.\n\nThe above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a potential participation in a clinical trial.",
