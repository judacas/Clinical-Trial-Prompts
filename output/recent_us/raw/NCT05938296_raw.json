Female of childbearing potential (FCBP)† must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL within 10 - 14 days prior to and again within 24 hours of starting and must either commit to continued abstinence from heterosexual intercourse or use acceptable methods of birth control, one highly effective method and one additional effective method AT THE SAME TIME, and at least 28 days before she starts taking treatment drugs. FCBP must also agree to ongoing pregnancy testing. Men must agree to use a latex condom during sexual contact with a FCBP even if they have had a vasectomy. All subjects must be counseled at a minimum of every 28 days about pregnancy precautions and risks of fetal exposure. Contraception measures should be continued for 3 months following the treatment completion.\n\n   †A FCBP (female of childbearing potential) is a sexually mature woman who has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months 12. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score less than or equal to 2 13. Participant must have received at least 1 prior line of therapy for multiple myeloma, including a proteasome inhibitor, lenalidomide, and glucocorticosteroids but not necessarily in one treatment regimen 14. Participant currently has documented progressive MM per IMWG criteria\nHealthy volunteers allowed",

Strong and Moderate CYP3A inhibitors: Exclude during ramp-up phase and consider alternative medications. If the subject requires use of these medications at the cohort designated dose, use with caution and reduce the venetoclax dose by 50% for moderate inhibitors and at least 75% for strong inhibitors during co-administration. After discontinuation of CYP3A inhibitor, wait for 2 to 3 days before venetoclax dose is increased back to the initial maintenance/target dose.\n    2.
