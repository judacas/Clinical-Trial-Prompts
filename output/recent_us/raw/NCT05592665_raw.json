    "exclusion_criteria": "* Within 28 days before first dose of protocol-indicated treatment:\n\n  * Anti-cancer treatment including chemotherapy, radiation, hormonal therapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, or biological therapy\n  * Major surgery requiring general anesthesia; (Note: within this time frame, placement of a central line or portacath is acceptable and does not exclude)\n  * Receipt of an investigational agent\n* Within 14 days before first dose of protocol-indicated treatment:\n\n  * Active uncontrolled infection; patients with infection under active treatment and controlled with antibiotics initiated at least 14 days prior to initiation of protocol-indicated treatment are not excluded (e.g. urinary tract infection controlled with antibiotics)\n* Dose escalation only: known grade 4 toxicity probably or definitely attributed to past irinotecan treatment\n* Active inflammatory bowel disease, other bowel disease causing chronic diarrhea (defined as > 4 loose stools per day), or bowel obstruction\n* History of interstitial pneumonitis or pulmonary fibrosis, or evidence of interstitial pneumonitis or pulmonary fibrosis on baseline chest CT scan\n* Unable to receive oral medication\n* Central nervous system (CNS) metastasis, unless asymptomatic or previously treated and stable; and no evidence of CNS progression for at least 30 days prior to initiating protocol-indicated treatment; anticonvulsant and/or corticosteroid therapy will be allowed if patient is on a stable or decreasing dose of such treatment for at least 30 days prior to initiating protocol-indicated treatment\n* Patients with known Gilbert's disease\n* Patient is pregnant or breastfeeding\n* Current or previous malignant disease (other than colorectal cancer) within the last 5 years; with the exception of the following if considered curatively treated: non-melanoma skin cancer(s), carcinoma in situ of the cervix, and ductal carcinoma in situ; subjects with another active malignancy requiring concurrent anti-cancer intervention are excluded; (Note the following does not exclude: effectively treated malignancy that has been in remission for more than 5 years and is considered to be cured AND no additional anti-cancer therapy is ongoing and required during the study period)\n* Known positive test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or cytomegalovirus (CMV)\n* Known psychiatric condition, social circumstance, or other medical condition reasonably judged by the patient's study physician to unacceptably increase the risk of study participation; or to prohibit the understanding or rendering of informed consent or anticipated compliance with scheduled visits, treatment schedule, laboratory tests and other study requirements.",
