Relapsed or refractory after two or more lines of therapy, including a CD20 antibody, if an indolent lymphoma.\n   2. Relapsed or refractory after two or more lines of therapy, including ibrutinib and venetoclax, if CLL.\n   3. Relapsed or refractory after two or more lines of therapy, including a CD20 antibody and an anthracycline, and the patient is ineligible for autologous stem cell transplantation, if an aggressive or highly aggressive lymphoma.\n\n      * Ineligibility for autologous stem cell transplantation includes non-responsive disease after salvage therapy and failure to mobilize stem cells for transplant.\n\n   Cohort B (ALL patients)\n\n   a.
