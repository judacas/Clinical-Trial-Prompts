    "official_title": "A Phase 2, Open-label Study of Encorafenib + Binimetinib in Patients With BRAFV600-mutant Non-small Cell Lung Cancer",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Histologically confirmed diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that is currently Stage IV.\n* Presence of a BRAFV600E mutation in lung cancer tissue as determined by a local laboratory assay or the presence of other BRAFV600 mutations other than V600E (i.e. K or D) will be considered\n* Patients who are either treatment-naïve (e.g., no prior systemic therapy for advanced/metastatic disease), OR who have received 1) first-line platinum-based chemotherapy OR 2) first-line treatment with an anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/ programmed cell death protein ligand 1(PD-L1) inhibitor given alone or in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy.\n* Presence of measurable disease based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1).\n* Eastern Cooperation Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.\n* Adequate bone marrow function characterized by the following at screening:\n\n  * absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 × 10⁹/L;\n  * Platelets ≥ 100 × 10⁹/L;\n  * Hemoglobin ≥ 8.5 g/dL (with or without blood transfusions).\n* Adequate hepatic and renal function characterized by the following at screening:\n\n  * Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN)\n  * alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 2.5 × ULN, or ≤ 5 × ULN in presence of liver metastases; Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × ULN; or calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min by Cockcroft-Gault formula; or estimated glomerular filtration rate > 50 mL/min/1.73m².\n\nKey\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Patients who have documentation of any of the following:\n\n  * epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation\n  * anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusion oncogene or\n  * ROS1 rearrangement\n* Patients who have received more than 1 prior line of systemic therapy in the advanced/metastatic setting.\n* Previous treatment with any BRAF inhibitor (e.g., dabrafenib, vemurafenib, XL281/BMS-908662, etc.), or any mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) inhibitor (e.g., trametinib, cobimetinib, selumetinib, RDEA119, etc.) prior to screening and enrollment.\n* Impaired cardiovascular function or clinically significant cardiovascular diseases\n* History of thromboembolic or cerebrovascular events ≤ 12 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment. Examples include transient ischemic attacks, cerebrovascular accidents, hemodynamically significant (i.e. massive or sub-massive) deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary emboli.\n* History or current evidence of retinal vein occlusion (RVO) or current risk factors for RVO (e.g., uncontrolled glaucoma or ocular hypertension, history of hyperviscosity or hypercoagulability syndromes); history of retinal degenerative disease.\n* Concurrent neuromuscular disorder that is associated with the potential of elevated creatine (phospho)kinase (CK) (e.g., inflammatory myopathies, muscular dystrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal muscular atrophy).\n* Patients with symptomatic brain metastasis, leptomeningeal disease or other active central nervous system (CNS) metastases are not eligible.",
