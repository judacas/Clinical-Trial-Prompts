patients must have progressed following the most recent therapy; prior treatment with irinotecan is allowed; for patients that received adjuvant chemotherapy: prior treatment for metastatic disease is not required for patient who experienced disease recurrence during or within 6 months of completion of adjuvant chemotherapy; if the patient received one line of adjuvant treatment and had disease recurrence after 6 months of completing chemotherapy, patients will only be eligible after failing one additional line of chemotherapy used to treat the metastatic or locally advanced, unresectable disease;

patients with mild or seasonal allergies may be included after discussion with the study chairs\n* Patients must not be planning treatment with other systemic anti-cancer agents (e.g., chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy) or other treatments not part of protocol-specified anti-cancer therapy including concurrent investigational agents of any type\n* No prior malignancy is allowed except for adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ, other low grade lesions such as incidental appendix carcinoid, or any other cancer from which the patient has been disease and treatment free for two years; prostate cancer patients on active surveillance are eligible\n* Patients must not be pregnant or nursing; females of child-bearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to registration; women/men of reproductive potential must have agreed to use an effective contraceptive method while on study and for at least 7 months after the last dose of study treatment; a woman is considered to be of \"reproductive potential\" if she has had menses at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months; in addition to routine contraceptive methods, \"effective contraception\" also includes heterosexual celibacy and surgery intended to prevent pregnancy (or with a side-effect of pregnancy prevention) defined as a hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral tubal ligation;
