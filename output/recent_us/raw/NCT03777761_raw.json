Myelosuppressive chemotherapy: At least 21 days after the last dose of myelosuppressive chemotherapy (42 days if prior nitrosourea).\n\n    ii. Hematopoietic growth factors: At least 14 days after the last dose of a long-acting growth factor (e.g. Neulasta) or 7 days for short-acting growth factor.\n\n    iii. Biologic (anti-neoplastic agent): At least 7 days after the last dose of a biologic agent. For agents that have known adverse events occurring beyond 7 days after administration, this period must be extended beyond the time during which adverse events are known to occur. The duration of this interval must be discussed with the study chair.\n\n    iv. Immunotherapy: At least 42 days after the completion of any type of immunotherapy, e.g. tumor vaccines.\n\n    v. Monoclonal antibodies: >21 days must have elapsed from the infusion of last dose of antibody and toxicity related to antibody therapy must be recovered to Grade ≤1.\n\n    vi. Radiation therapy: Patients must have had their last fraction of craniospinal or focal irradiation >4 weeks prior to enrollment.\n\n    vii. Stem Cell Transplant: Patients must be ≥3 months since autologous stem cell transplant. Patients who received allogenic stem cell transplant or solid organ transplant are not eligible for study.\n\n    Patient Exclusion Criteria\n\n    Individuals will be excluded from study participation if they:\n\n1) Have a seizure disorder where >1 seizure has occurred within the last year. 2) Have clinically significant cardiovascular disease (e.g., significant cardiac conduction abnormalities, uncontrolled hypertension, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmia or unstable angina, New York Heart Association Grade 3 or greater congestive heart failure, serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication, Grade 2 or greater peripheral vascular disease, or history of cerebrovascular accident [CVA]) within 6 months of enrollment.\n\n3) History or presence of an abnormal ECG that, in the Investigator's opinion, is clinically meaningful. Screening QTcF interval >480 ms is excluded. In the event that a single QTcF is >480 ms, the patient may enroll if the average QTcF for the 3 ECGs is <480 ms. For patients with an intraventricular conduction delay (QRS interval >120 ms), the JTc interval may be used in place of the QTcF with Sponsor approval. The JTc must be <340 ms if JTc is used in place of the QTcF. Patients with an intraventricular delay due to a left bundle branch block are excluded. Note: QTcF prolongation due to pacemaker may enroll if the JTc is normal.\n\n4) Patient with treated (surgically excised or irradiated) and stable brain metastases are eligible as long as the treatment was at least 4 weeks prior to initiation of study drug and baseline brain computed tomography (CT) with contrast or MRI within 2 weeks of initiation of study drug is negative for new brain metastases. Patients with stable brain metastases must not require therapy with corticosteroids.\n\n5) Have major surgery, other than diagnostic surgery, within 4-weeks prior to Day 1.\n\n6) Have active, bacterial, viral, or fungal infections, requiring systemic therapy.\n\n7) Women who are pregnant or lactating. NOTE: Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a \"negative\" serum pregnancy test within 1 week prior to treatment.\n\na) Women not OCBP defined as any of the following: i. Postmenopausal with >1 year since last menses and:\n\n1. If younger than 65 years old, with a follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) >40 mIU/mL.\n2. If older than 65 years old and not on hormone replacement therapy (HRT), with a FSH >30 mIU/mL.\n3. If older than 65 years old and on HRT, the FSH requirement in not applicable. Postmenopausal females on HRT will be allowed if the treatment is stable for at least 6 months prior to dosing of study drug(s).\n4. Written medical documentation of being sterilized (e.g. hysterectomy, double oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy) with the procedure performed at least 6 months prior to dosing study drug(s). Note: Tubal ligation is not considered a form of permanent sterilization.\n5. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.\n\n8) Have undergone treatment with radiation therapy, surgery, chemotherapy, or immunotherapy, within 4-weeks prior to study entry (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or Mitomycin C). Patients may also not have any unresolved toxicity >Grade 1 from previous anticancer therapy, except for stable chronic toxicities that are not expected to resolve (i.e. peripheral neuropathy, alopecia etc.). Patients who have an ongoing requirement for thyroid replacement therapy from prior exposure to a checkpoint inhibitor but who are clinically euthyroid are permitted.\n\n9) Have an unwillingness or inability to comply with procedures required in this protocol.\n\n10) Current active liver disease from any cause, including hepatitis A (hepatitis A virus immunoglobulin M positive), hepatitis B (hepatitis B virus [HBV] surface antigen positive), or hepatitis C (hepatitis C virus [HCV] antibody positive, confirmed by HCV ribonucleic acid). Subjects with HCV with undetectable virus after treatment are eligible. Subjects with a prior history of HBV are eligible if quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HBV DNA is negative. Note that elevated levels of biotin may interfere with viral serology testing.\n\n11) Have a serious nonmalignant disease that in the opinion of the Investigator and/or the Medical Monitor, could compromise protocol objectives.\n\n12) Patients who are currently receiving any other investigational agent or who have received an investigational agent within the last 28 days.\n\n13) Known gastrointestinal disease or procedure that could interfere with the absorption of study drug, including inability to swallow whole capsules or conditions that may interfere with absorption. The Medical Monitor should be contacted for any questions regarding this exclusion criterion.\n\n14) Patients who have exhibited allergic reactions to a similar structural compound, biological agent, or formulation.\n\n15) Use of biotin (i.e., Vitamin B7) or supplements containing biotin higher than the daily adequate intake of 30 µg (NIH-ODS, 2020). (Note: Subjects who switch from a high dose to a dose of 30 µg/day or less are eligible for study entry.) 16) Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 or HIV-2. Exception: subjects with well-controlled HIV (e.g., CD4 >350/mm3 and undetectable viral load) are eligible.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 12 Years",
