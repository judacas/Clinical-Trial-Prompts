    "inclusion_criteria": "* ≥2.0 months of age at initiation of busulfan conditioning\n* Diagnosis of typical or leaky ART-SCID:\n\nNewly diagnosed ART-SCID patients must have:\n\n* Artemis deficiency; AND\n* CD3 count < 300 autologous cells/µL (typical ART-SCID) OR spontaneous maternal chimerism, OR CD3 count >300/µL but with restricted T cell receptor Vb diversity, defined as 18/24 or fewer polyclonal families.\n\nAND - CD45 cell response to mitogens (PHA) < 50% of the lower limit of normal range for the lab (leaky ART-SCID).\n\nPatients diagnosed with ART-SCID per the criteria above who have failed an allogeneic transplant (including an HLA matched sibling transplant) may participate if they meet the criteria below:\n\n- Are at least 3 months post allogeneic hematopoeitic stem cell transplant without evidence of engraftment of allogeneic donor cells (excluding maternal cells)\n\nOR are engrafted but have at least 2 of the following 4 conditions:\n\n* Declining CD3 donor chimerism with at least 3 evaluations separated by at least 1 month prior to time of enrollment OR < 5% overall donor chimerism in blood and marrow at ≥3 months post transplant.\n* Incompletely reconstituted T cell immunity at ≥6 months (1 of the following 2):\n\n  * CD4 < 200/μL AND CD45 cell PHA < 50% of the lower limit of normal for lab;\n  * CD4 CD45RA < 20% of total CD4 cells OR T cell receptor Vb diversity is restricted, defined as 18/24 or fewer polyclonal families.\n  * No donor B cells OR lack of B cell function (immunoglobulin M isohemagglutinins < 1:8 (not blood type AB) AND immunoglobulin A (IgA) or IgM values below reference range for age AND if not receiving intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), no protective level of antibody to tetanus immunization x2).\n  * Clinical manifestations consistent with persistent T and B cell immunodeficiency e.g., chronic infection including norovirus, cytomegalovirus, human herpes virus 6; OR acute or recurrent infection (e.g., PJP), bronchiectasis, chronic sinusitis.\n\nAND\n\n* Have no prior exposure to high dose busulfan (≥10 mg/kg total dose or average cumulative exposure of ≥40 mg*hr/L). If the total cumulative AUC including previous busulfan exposure plus the dose to be administered in this protocol is predicted to be ≤60 mg*hr/L, then patient would be eligible providing other criteria are satisfied.\n* No medically eligible HLA-identical sibling with a normal immune system who could serve as an allogeneic bone marrow donor (applies to newly diagnosed patients only).\n\nWritten informed consent according to guidelines of the Institutional Review Board (IRB).\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 2 Months",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Liver function tests (aspartate aminotransferase, alanine transaminase, gamma-glutamyl transferase) > three times the upper limit of normal for lab and/or total bilirubin >1.50 mg/dl at the time of planned initiation of busulfan conditioning.\n* Prior history of veno-occlusive disease (Sinusoidal obstruction syndrome) of the liver.\n* Medically eligible HLA-matched sibling (applies to newly diagnosed patients only).\n* Evidence of HIV infection by polymerase chain reaction or p24 antigen testing.\n* Unable to tolerate general anesthesia and/or marrow harvest or peripheral blood stem cell collection (apheresis) or insertion of central venous catheter.\n* Presence of a medical condition indicating that survival is predicted to be less than 4 months, such as the requirement for mechanical ventilation, severe failure of a major organ system, or evidence of a serious, progressive infection that is refractory to medical therapy.\n* Pregnancy\n* A social situation indicating that the family may not be able to comply with protocol procedures and recommended medical care and follow-up.\n* Other conditions which in the opinion of the Principal Investigator and/or co-investigators, contra-indicate the infusion of transduced cells or study participation.",
