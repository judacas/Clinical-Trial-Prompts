Note: Oral agents and Lovenox, etc., are monitored by factor 10 levels, not PT or partial thromboplastin time (PTT).\n* Participants receiving inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4/3A5 as well as participants receiving P-glycoprotein inhibitors within 2 weeks prior to study treatment initiation treatment initiation\n\n(https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/DrugInteractionsLabeling/ucm093664.htm#table2-2,table3-3,table5-2,\n\n* Positive Hepatitis A (HAV) serological test, positive Hepatitis B (HBV) serological test, or positive Hepatitis C (HCV) serological test with detected quantitative HCV RNA at screening.\n* Participants seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.\n* Active infections requiring systemic therapy.\n* Immunosuppressive medications within 4 weeks prior to study treatment initiation except non-systemic corticosteroids.\n* Positive beta human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-HCG) serum or urine pregnancy test performed in individuals of childbearing potential at screening.\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness evaluated by medical history and physical exam or situation that is not stable (e.g., recent hospitalization, Emergency Room visit or undergoing medication changes) that would potentially increase in risk of participant.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 120 Years",
