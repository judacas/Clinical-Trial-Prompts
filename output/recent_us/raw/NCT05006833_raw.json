    "official_title": "A Phase II Study of Naxitamab Added to Induction Therapy for Subjects With Newly Diagnosed High-Risk Neuroblastoma",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Diagnosis: Subjects must have a diagnosis of neuroblastoma or ganglioneuroblastoma (nodular or intermixed) verified by histology or demonstration of clumps of tumor cells in bone marrow with elevated urinary catecholamine metabolites. Subjects with the following disease stages at diagnosis are eligible, if they meet the other specified criteria:\n\n  a) Subjects with newly diagnosed neuroblastoma with International Neuroblastoma Staging System (INSS) Stage 4 are eligible with the following: i. Age > 18 months (> 547 days) regardless of biologic features or ii. Age 12-18 months (365-547 days) with any of the following 3 unfavorable biologic features (MYCN amplification, unfavorable pathology and/or DNA index = 1) or iii. MYCN amplification (> 4-fold increase in MYCN signals as compared to reference signals), regardless of age or additional biologic features.\n\n  b) Subjects with newly diagnosed neuroblastoma with INSS Stage 3 are eligible with the following: i. MYCN amplification (> 4-fold increase in MYCN signals as compared to reference signals), regardless of age or additional biologic features or ii. Age > 18 months (> 547 days) with unfavorable pathology, regardless of MYCN status.\n\n  c) Subjects with newly diagnosed neuroblastoma with INSS Stage 2A/2B with MYCN amplification (> 4-fold increase in MYCN signals as compared to reference signals), regardless of age or additional biologic features.\n* Subjects must be age ≤ 21 years at initial diagnosis\n* Subjects must be >12 months of age at enrollment\n* Ability to tolerate Peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) collection: No known contraindication to PBSC collection. Examples of contraindications would include a weight or size less than that determined to be feasible at the collecting institution, or a physical condition that would limit the ability of the child to undergo apheresis catheter placement (if necessary) and/or the apheresis procedure.\n* Adequate Cardiac Function Defined As:\n\n  1. Shortening fraction of ≥ 27% by echocardiogram, or\n  2. Ejection fraction of ≥ 50% by radionuclide evaluation or echocardiogram.\n* Adequate liver function must be demonstrated, defined as:\n\n  1. Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) for age AND\n  2. ALT (SGPT) < 5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) for age\n* Subjects must have adequate renal function defined as a serum creatinine based on age/gender as follows:\n\nAge Maximum Serum Creatinine (mg/dL) Male Female 1 to < 2 years 0.6 0.6 2 to < 6 years 0.8 0.8 6 to < 10 years 1 1 10 to < 13 years 1.2 1.2 13 to < 16 years 1.5 1.4\n\n≥ 16 years 1.7 1.4\n\n* A negative serum pregnancy test is required for female participants of childbearing potential (≥13 years of age or after onset of menses)\n* Both male and female post-pubertal study subjects must be willing to use a highly effective contraceptive method (i.e., achieves a failure rate of <1% per year when used consistently and correctly) from the time of informed consent until 6 months after study treatment discontinuation. Such methods include: combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral, intravaginal, transdermal), progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral, injectable, implantable), intrauterine device (IUD), intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS), bilateral tubal occlusion, vasectomized partner, sexual abstinence.\n* Informed Consent: All subjects and/or legal guardians must sign informed written consent. Assent, when appropriate, will be obtained according to institutional guidelines.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 12 Months\nMust have maximum age of 21 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Subjects who are less than 1 year of age\n* Subjects who are 12-18 months of age with INSS Stage 4 and all stage 3 subjects with favorable biologic features (i.e., nonamplified MYCN, favorable pathology, and DNA index > 1) are not eligible.\n* Subjects who have had prior systemic therapy except for localized emergency radiation to sites of life-threatening or function-threatening disease and/or no more than 1 cycle of chemotherapy per a low or intermediate risk neuroblastoma regimen (as per P9641, A3961, ANBL0531, or similar) prior to determination of MYCN amplification status and histology.\n* Treatment with immunosuppressive treatment (local steroids excluded) within 4 weeks prior to enrollment\n* Inadequate pulmonary function defined as evidence of dyspnea at rest, exercise intolerance, and/or chronic oxygen requirement. In addition, room air pulse oximetry < 94% and/or abnormal pulmonary function tests if these assessments are clinically indicated.\n* Pregnant or breastfeeding (NOTE: breast milk cannot be stored for future use while the mother is being treated on study.)\n* Subjects receiving any investigational drug concurrently.\n* Subjects with any other medical condition, including but not limited to malabsorption syndromes, mental illness or substance abuse, deemed by the Investigator to be likely to interfere with the interpretation of the results or which would interfere with a subject's ability to sign or the legal guardian's ability to sign the informed consent, and subject's ability to cooperate and participate in the study.\n* Subjects with a significant intercurrent illness (any ongoing serious medical problem unrelated to cancer or its treatment) that is not covered by the detailed exclusion criteria and that is expected to interfere with the action of investigational medicinal products (IMPs) or to significantly increase the severity of the toxicities experienced from trial treatment.",
