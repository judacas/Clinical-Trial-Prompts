    "exclusion_criteria": "* Patients post CAR-T who have bulky disease defined as a disease focus >= 7.5cm in diameter at day 30 +/- 7 days PET-CT assessment\n* Patients post CAR-T who have progressive disease, stable disease or complete response at day 30 +/- 7 days PET-CT assessment based on Lugano criteria\n* Any of the following because this study involves an investigational agent whose genotoxic, mutagenic, and teratogenic effect on the developing fetus and newborn are unknown\n\n  * Pregnant persons\n  * Nursing persons\n  * Persons of childbearing potential who are unwilling to employ adequate contraception (men and women)\n* Any of the following prior therapies:\n\n  * CD20xCD3 bispecific antibody at any point prior to registration\n  * CD20-targeted monoclonal antibody (e.g., rituximab, obinutuzumab or biosimilars) =< 4 weeks prior to registration\n* Ongoing cytokine release syndrome (CRS) or neurotoxicity post CAR-T\n* Prior grade 4 CRS or neurotoxicity after most recently administered CAR-T\n* Primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma or CNS involvement by lymphoma at screening and based on clinical symptoms, MRI, or lumbar puncture\n* Co-morbid systemic illness or other severe concurrent disease which, in the judgement of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into the study or interfere significantly with the proper assessment of safety and toxicity of the prescribed regimens\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to:\n\n  * Ongoing or active infection requiring systemic treatment (excluding prophylactic treatment) =< 14 days prior to registration, including COVID- 19 infection.\n\n    * NOTE: If evidence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, HBV viral load must be undetectable and on suppressive therapy.\n    * NOTE: If history of treated hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, HCV viral load must be undetectable.\n    * NOTE: Patients known to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive, but stable on anti-retroviral therapy with an undetectable HIV viral load pre-CART, are eligible for this trial.\n    * NOTE: Simple urinary tract infection (UTI) and uncomplicated bacterial pharyngitis are permitted if responding to active treatment\n    * NOTE: Past COVID-19 infection may be a risk factor, but if resolved symptoms and the subject is vaccinated, they may be enrolled\n  * Symptomatic congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class 3 or 4)\n  * Unstable angina pectoris\n  * Unstable cardiac arrhythmia present =< 14 days prior to registration\n  * Psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirement\n  * History or presence of CNS disorder such as seizure disorder (not including resolved childhood febrile seizures), cerebrovascular ischemia/hemorrhage (not including transient ischemic attacks), cerebellar disease, or any autoimmune disease with CNS involvement\n* Receiving any other investigational agent which would be considered treatment for the primary neoplasm =< 14 days prior to registration\n* Other active malignancy requiring therapy < 2 years prior to registration (localized non-melanoma skin cancer is allowed)\n* Clinically significant cardiovascular disease, including: Myocardial infarction within 1 year prior to randomization, or unstable or uncontrolled disease/condition related to or affecting cardiac function (eg, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, New York Heart Association class III-IV) cardiac arrhythmia (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] version 5.0 grade 2 or higher), or clinically significant electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities",
