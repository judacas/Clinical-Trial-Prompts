Patients with unsuccessful baseline biopsies may undergo an additional biopsy attempt (at the same or a different site, determined by the investigator).\n   2.

Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required.\n11. Female subjects of childbearing potential should be willing to use 2 methods of birth control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course of the study through 120 days after the last dose of study medication. Subjects of childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not been free from menses for > 1 year.\n\n    * Male subjects should agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting with the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy.\n    * Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and preferred contraception for the subject.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1.

Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical cancer.\n12.

Patients with asymptomatic suspected brain metastases (or small lesions of uncertain significance) <1 cm that do not require focal therapy are eligible. (Follow up imaging will be allowed on study, and focal radiation with continuation of protocol therapy allowed if there is progressive disease in the brain and systemic imaging shows stable disease/response).\n\n    - Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least four weeks and any neurologic symptoms have returned to baseline), they have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases (confirmed by imaging within 28 d of the first dose of trial treatment), and they are not using steroids for at least 7 days prior to trial treatment.
