    "official_title": "A Phase 3, Multicenter, Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Trial Comparing the Efficacy and Safety of Tafasitamab Plus Lenalidomide in Addition to R-CHOP Versus R-CHOP in Previously Untreated, High-intermediate and High-risk Patients With Newly-diagnosed Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL)",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Previously untreated patients with local biopsy-proven, CD20-positive DLBCL, including one of the following diagnoses by 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of lymphoid neoplasms are eligible:\n\n  1. DLBCL, NOS including GCB type, ABC type\n  2. T-cell rich large BCL\n  3. Epstein-Barr virus-positive DLBCL, NOS\n  4. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive large BCL\n  5. Human herpes virus-8 (HHV8)-positive DLBCL, NOS\n  6. High-grade BCL with MYC and B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) and/or B-cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6) rearrangements (double-hit or triple-hit lymphoma). Please note: Patients must be appropriate candidates for R-CHOP. If an investigator deems a patient with a known double- or triple-hit lymphoma (HGBL) should be treated more aggressively (e.g. dose-adjusted etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and rituximab [DA-EPOCH-R] or cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin and dexamethasone (CVAD) followed by methotrexate and cytarabine [Hyper CVAD]), this patient would not be considered eligible for this study\n  7. HGBL-NOS\n  8. DLBCL coexistent with either follicular lymphoma (FL) of any grade, gastric MALT lymphoma or non-gastric MALT lymphoma\n  9. FL grade 3b\n* Availability of archival or freshly collected tumor tissue sent for retrospective central pathology review\n* IPI status of 3 to 5 (for patients > 60 years of age) or aaIPI 2 to 3 (for patients ≤ 60 years of age)\n* Diagnosis to treatment interval, defined as the time between the date of DLBCL diagnosis (date of the first biopsy specimen containing B Cell lymphoma according to the local pathology report) and the start of treatment (C1D1) ≤ 28 days\n* ECOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2\n* Left ventricular ejection fraction equal to or greater 50% as assessed by local echocardiography or cardiac multi-gated acquisition (MUGA) scan\n* Adequate hematologic function\n* Female participants: Agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive methods and refrain from breast feeding and donating eggs; agreement to ongoing pregnancy testing during the course of the study, and after study therapy has ended\n* Male participants: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use a condom and agreement to refrain from donating sperm\n\nMajor\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 80 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Any other histological type of lymphoma according to WHO 2016 classification of lymphoid neoplasms, e.g., primary mediastinal (thymic) large B-cell lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, BCL, unclassifiable, with features intermediate between DLBCL and classical Hodgkin lymphoma (grey-zone lymphoma); primary effusion lymphoma; primary cutaneous DLBCL, leg type; primary DLBCL of the CNS; DLBCL arising from CLL or indolent lymphoma\n* History of prior non-hematologic malignancy except for the following:\n\n  1. Malignancy treated with curative intent and with no evidence of active disease present for more than 2 years before screening\n  2. Adequately treated lentigo maligna melanoma without current evidence of disease or adequately controlled non-melanomatous skin cancer\n  3. Adequately treated carcinoma in situ without current evidence of disease\n* Any systemic anti-lymphoma and/or investigational therapy prior to the start of C1D1, except for permitted pre-phase treatment\n* Contraindication to any of the individual components of R-CHOP, including prior receipt of anthracyclines\n* Known CNS lymphoma involvement\n* Known active systemic bacterial, viral, fungal, or other infection at screening, including patients with suspected active or latent tuberculosis (as confirmed by a positive interferon-gamma release assay)\n* History or evidence of clinically significant cardiovascular, CNS and/or other systemic disease that in the investigator's opinion would preclude participation in the study or compromise the patient's ability to give informed consent",
