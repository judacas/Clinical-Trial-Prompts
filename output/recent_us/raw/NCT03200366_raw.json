    "official_title": "CYCLONE 3: A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study of Abemaciclib in Combination With Abiraterone Plus Prednisone in Men With High-Risk Metastatic Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Adenocarcinoma of the prostate (as the predominant histology)\n* High-risk metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. High risk is defined as:\n\n  * Greater than or equal to (≥)4 bone metastases by bone scan and/or\n  * ≥1 visceral metastases by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging\n* Must have initiated androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist/antagonist or bilateral orchiectomy prior to randomization. Up to 3 months of ADT prior to randomization is permitted with or without first-generation anti-androgen.\n* Adequate organ function\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be MALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Prior treatment with abemaciclib or any other cyclin dependent kinase 4 and 6 (CDK4 & 6) inhibitor\n* Development of metastatic prostate cancer in the context of castrate levels of testosterone\n* Received any prior systemic therapy for metastatic prostate cancer (including investigational agents), except for ADT and first-generation anti-androgen\n* Clinically significant cardiovascular disease as evidenced by myocardial infarction, arterial thrombotic events, or severe/unstable angina in the past 6 months, or New York Heart Association Class II to IV heart failure\n* History of syncope of cardiovascular etiology, ventricular arrhythmia of pathological origin, or sudden cardiac arrest. Chronic and hemodynamically stable atrial arrhythmia well-controlled on medical therapy is permitted\n* Uncontrolled hypertension\n* Clinically active or chronic liver disease, moderate/severe hepatic impairment\n* Known untreated central nervous system (CNS) metastasis. Participants with a history of treated brain metastases are eligible if stable for at least 8 weeks prior to randomization and off corticosteroid for at least 2 weeks prior to randomization",
