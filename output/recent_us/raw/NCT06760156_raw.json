    "inclusion_criteria": "* Patient is older than 18 years, is not a surgical candidate or refuses to have surgery\n* Patient is medically fit to undergo local anesthesia with or without conscious sedation\n* Patient is able to understand and give consent to participation in the study\n* Presence of compression symptoms or cosmetic concerns for which patient request treatment of the benign thyroid nodule\n* Solitary thyroid nodule or dominating nodule that is well-defined in multinodular goiter\n* Benign nodule is >= 2 cm in the largest dimension, and has either solid, or predominantly solid composition (>= 70% volume) without large calcification. Nodule is confirmed as benign (Bethesda II) on at least 2 ultrasound guided fine needle aspirations (FNA) or core needle biopsy (CNB) or a single benign diagnosis of FNA or CNB when the nodule has benign ultrasound features (American College of Radiology [ACR] Thyroid Imaging Reporting & Data System [TI-RAD] TR 1-3, American Thyroid Association [ATA] very low suspicion) within 6 months of planned RFA\n* Indeterminate thyroid nodule (atypical cells of undetermined significance [ACUS], follicular neoplasm), papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) without metastasis or locally recurrent thyroid cancer < 2 cm in the largest dimension. Nodule cytology is confirmed on a single FNA or CNB when the nodule has concordant ultrasound features (ACR TI-RAD TR 4-5, ATA intermediate-high suspicion) within 6 months of planned RFA\n* Entirety of the selected nodule is visible on ultrasound without significant extension posterior to trachea or mediastinal component\n* Selected nodule is amenable to trans-isthmus approach\n* Normal complete blood count, blood coagulation, serum levels of thyroid hormones, thyrotropin (TSH), calcitonin, and absence of anti-thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAb) and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb)\n* Patient agrees to participate in the clinical study and to complete all required visits and evaluations\n* Negative serum or urine pregnancy test for females of childbearing potential at base line pre-procedure evaluation\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Patients with cardiac arrhythmia and/or implanted cardiac device\n* Hyper-functioning nodules, evaluated by thyroid function test and/or 99mTc-pertechnetate scintigraphic findings\n* History of neck radiation therapy\n* Pregnancy\n* Allergies to medications for anesthesia\n* Primary thyroid PTC with aggressive histology (tall cell, columnar cell, insular, e.g.) in consultation with cytology, endocrine and surgery team\n* Extra-thyroidal invasion of PTC OR local nodal/distant systemic metastatic disease\n* Cystic nodules (< 70% solid components)\n* Calcified nodules\n* Targeted nodule within 0.5 cm from the major vessels, vagus nerve, brachial plexus, and recurrent laryngeal nerve\n* Patients with contralateral vocal cord paralysis\n* Uncorrectable coagulopathy with partial thromboplastin time (PTT) > 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) or international normalized ratio (INR) > 1.5 or platelet count <100,000 per mm^3",
