Note: Local surgery of isolated lesions for palliative intent is acceptable.\n* History of allogeneic organ transplantation (eg, liver transplant).\n* History of hepatic encephalopathy within past 12 months or requirement for medications to prevent or control encephalopathy (eg, no lactulose, rifaximin, etc if used for purposes of hepatic encephalopathy).\n* Ascites that require ongoing paracentesis, within 6 weeks prior to the first scheduled dose of study drug(s), to control symptoms.\n* Main portal vein thrombosis present on imaging.\n* Active or prior documented GI variceal bleed or history of upper GI bleeding, ulcers, or esophageal varices with bleeding within 12 months; adequate endoscopic therapy according to institutional standards is required for participants with history of esophageal variceal bleeding or assessed as high risk for esophageal variceal by the treating investigator.\n* Participant currently exhibits symptomatic or uncontrolled hypertension defined as diastolic blood pressure &gt;90 mmHg or systolic blood pressure &gt;140 mmHg.\n* Active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders (including inflammatory bowel disease [eg, colitis or Crohn&#39;s disease], diverticulitis [with the exception of diverticulosis], systemic lupus erythematosus, Sarcoidosis syndrome, or Wegener syndrome [granulomatosis with polyangiitis, Graves&#39; disease, rheumatoid arthritis, hypophysitis, uveitis, etc]). Participants without active disease in the last 5 years are excluded unless discussed with the Study Physician and considered appropriate for study participation.
