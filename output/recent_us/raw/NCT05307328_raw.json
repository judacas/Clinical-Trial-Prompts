    "exclusion_criteria": "* EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR STEPS 1, 2, AND 3\n* Persistent toxicities (> Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] grade 2) caused by previous cancer therapy, excluding alopecia\n* Patients receiving any systemic chemotherapy or radiotherapy (except for palliative reasons) within 3 weeks prior to study treatment\n* Major surgery within 2 weeks of starting study treatment and patients must have recovered from any effects of any major surgery\n* Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents\n* Other malignancy unless curatively treated with no evidence of disease for >= 5 years except: adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer, curatively treated in situ cancer of the cervix, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), or stage 1, grade 1 endometrial carcinoma. A patient with a history of localized triple negative breast cancer may be eligible, provided the patient completed the adjuvant chemotherapy > 3 years prior to registration, and the patient remains free of recurrent or metastatic disease\n* Patients with myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia (MDS/AML) or with bone marrow findings consistent with MDS/AML\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to olaparib, copanlisib, PI3K inhibitors or MEDI4736 (durvalumab) or any of the excipients of any study products\n* Concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors and inducers\n\n  * Olaparib: concomitant use of known strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., itraconazole, telithromycin, clarithromycin, protease inhibitors boosted with ritonavir or cobicistat, indinavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, boceprevir, telaprevir) or moderate CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, diltiazem, fluconazole, verapamil). The required washout period for strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors prior to starting olaparib is 2 weeks\n  * Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product\n  * Concomitant use of known strong CYP3A inducers (e.g., phenobarbital, enzalutamide, phenytoin, rifampicin, rifabutin, rifapentine, carbamazepine, nevirapine and St John's Wort) or moderate CYP3A inducers (e.g., bosentan, efavirenz, modafinil). The required washout period for strong or moderate CYP3A inducers prior to starting olaparib is 5 weeks for enzalutamide or phenobarbital and 3 weeks for other agents\n  * Copanlisib: copanlisib is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4. Therefore, the concomitant use of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir), and strong inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g. rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, St. John's Wort) are not permitted from 14 days prior to enrollment until the end of the study\n  * Other medications that are prohibited while on copanlisib treatment:\n\n    * Herbal medications/preparations (except for vitamins)\n    * Anti-arrhythmic therapy other than beta blockers or digoxin\n  * Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference for a list of drugs to avoid or minimize use of. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, uncontrolled major seizure disorder, unstable spinal cord compression, superior vena cava syndrome, extensive interstitial bilateral lung disease on high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan, symptomatic congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements\n* Resting electrocardiogram (ECG) indicating uncontrolled, potentially reversible cardiac conditions, as judged by the investigator (e.g., unstable ischemia, uncontrolled symptomatic arrhythmia, congestive heart failure, QT corrected by the Fridericia formula [QTcF] prolongation of > 500 msec, electrolyte disturbances), or patients with congenital long QT syndrome\n* Women who are breast feeding or pregnant are excluded from this study because olaparib is a poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with olaparib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with olaparib and copanlisib +/- MEDI4736 (durvalumab)\n* Previous allogenic bone marrow transplant or double umbilical cord blood transplantation (dUCBT)\n* Packed red blood cell or platelet transfusion in the last 28 days prior to study entry\n* Whole blood transfusions in the last 120 days prior to study entry. Whole blood transfusions performed within 120 days of study entry may interfere with blood samples taken for exploratory analysis\n* Patients should be excluded if they have a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (> 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study drug administration. However, systemic corticosteroids may be indicated after starting the study drugs to treat immune-related adverse reactions. Inhaled or topical steroids and adrenal replacement doses =< 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease\n* Patients with non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture\n* Arterial or venous thrombotic or embolic events such as cerebrovascular accident (including transient ischemic attacks), deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism within 6 months before the start of study medication\n* Patients with active, clinically serious infections > grade 2 (CTCAE version[v] 5.0).

Patients with a past or resolved HBV infection (defined as the presence of hepatitis B core antibody [anti-HBc] and absence of HBsAg) are eligible. Patients positive for hepatitis C (HCV) antibody are eligible only if polymerase chain reaction is negative for HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA). HBV/HCV screening is required 28 days prior to starting the study drug using a routine hepatitis virus lab panel\n* Active infection requiring IV antibiotics or other uncontrolled intercurrent illness requiring hospitalization\n* Patients unable to swallow orally administered medication and any medical condition or diagnosis that would likely impair absorption of an orally administered drug (e.g. gastrectomy, ileal bypass, chronic diarrhea, gastroparesis)\n* Known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial\n* Known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least four weeks prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using steroids for at least 7 days prior to trial treatment. This exception does not include carcinomatous meningitis which is excluded regardless of clinical stability\n* New York Heart Association class III or IV heart disease\n* History or concurrent interstitial lung disease of any severity and/or severely impaired lung function (as judged by the investigator)\n* Uncontrolled arterial hypertension despite optimal medical management (per investigator's opinion)\n* Patients with uncontrolled type I or II diabetes mellitus, defined as fasting blood glucose ˃ 160 mg/dL and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) ˃ 8%, are ineligible\n* EXCLUSION STEPS 2 AND 3 ONLY\n* Patients who have not recovered from grade >= 2 adverse events due to prior anti-cancer therapy with the exception of alopecia, vitiligo, and the laboratory values defined in the inclusion criteria\n\n  * Patients with grade >= 2 neuropathy will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis after consultation with the study physician\n* Major surgical procedure (as defined by the investigator) within 28 days prior to the first dose of investigational product (IP).
