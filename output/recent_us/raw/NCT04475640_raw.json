    "exclusion_criteria": "* Any known additional malignancy (with exception of non-melanoma skin cancer, in-situ breast cancer, low risk prostate cancer, or a malignancy diagnosed >= 3 years prior to the current NSCLC diagnosis and with no evidence of requiring active treatment)\n* Had prior treatment with an anti-PD-1, or PD-L1 or PD-L2 agent or an antibody targeting other immuno-regulatory receptors or mechanisms\n* Has any serious or uncontrolled active infection that could create false positives on a PET/CT scan, in the opinion of the treating investigator\n* Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator\n* Has an active autoimmune disease currently requiring systemic treatment (e.g. disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs)\n\n  **Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment\n* Has known, active, and symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis\n\n  * Patients with stable or previously treated brain metastases are eligible as long as they are not receiving more than 10 mg of prednisone, or equivalent, per day",
