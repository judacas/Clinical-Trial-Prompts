    "official_title": "A Randomized, Double-Blind, Phase III Clinical Trial of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy With Atezolizumab or Placebo in Patients With Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Followed by Adjuvant Continuation of Atezolizumab or Placebo",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* The patient must have consented to participate and, prior to beginning specific study procedures, must have signed and dated an appropriate IRB-approved consent form that conforms to federal and institutional guidelines for study treatment and for submission of tumor samples from a research biospy as required by NSABP B-59/GBG 96-GeparDouze for baseline correlative science studies.\n* The diagnosis of invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast must have been made by core needle biopsy.\n* Local testing on the diagnostic core must have determined the tumor to be ER-negative, PgR-negative, and HER2-negative by current ASCO/CAP guidelines. (If local testing has determined a tumor to be HER2 equivocal or to have a borderline ER/PgR status (% IHC staining < 10% for both) and other eligibility criteria are met, material may be submitted for central testing to determine eligibility.)\n* Central testing for ER, PgR, and HER2 will be performed, and the tumor must be determined to be ER-negative, PgR-negative, and HER2-negative by current ASCO/CAP Guidelines Recommendations.\n* The tumor specimen used for central ER, PgR, and HER2 testing must also be used for central testing of PD-L1 status using the Ventana PD-L1 testing result including PD-L1 indeterminate Patients will be classifies as positive, negative, or indeterminate for stratification purposes.\n* Patients must be ≥ 18 years old.\n* Patient may be female or male.\n* The ECOG performance status must be 0-1.\n* The primary tumor can be clinical stage T2 or T3, if clinically node negative according to AJCC 7th Edition. If the regional lymph nodes are cN1 and cytologically or histologically positive or cN2-N3 with or without a biopsy, the primary breast tumor can be clinically T1c, T2, or T3.\n* Ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes must be evaluated by imaging (mammogram, ultrasound, and/or MRI) within 84 days prior to study entry. If suspicious or abnormal, FNA or core biopsy is recommended. Findings of these evaluations will be used to define the nodal status prior to study entry according to the following criteria:\n\n  * Nodal status - negative (Imaging of the axilla is negative; Imaging is suspicious or abnormal but the FNA or core biopsy of the questionable node[s] on imaging is negative)\n  * Nodal status - positive (FNA or core biopsy of the node[s] is cytologically or histologically suspicious or positive; Imaging is suspicious or abnormal but FNA or core biopsy was not performed.)\n* Patients with synchronous bilateral or multicentric HER2-negative breast cancer are eligible as long as the highest risk tumor is ER-negative and PgR-negative and meets stage eligibility criteria. All of the other invasive tumors must also be HER2-negative by ASCO/CAP Guidelines based on local testing. Central testing to confirm TNBC status is only required for the highest risk tumor.\n* Blood counts performed within 28 days prior to randomization must meet the following criteria:\n\n  * ANC must be ≥ 1500/mm3;\n  * platelet count must be ≥ 100,000/mm3; and\n  * hemoglobin must be ≥10 g/dL.\n* The following criteria for evidence of adequate hepatic function performed within 28 days prior to randomization must be met:\n\n  * total bilirubin must be ≤ ULN for the lab unless the patient has a bilirubin elevation > ULN to 1.5 x ULN due to Gilbert's disease or similar syndrome involving slow conjugation of bilirubin; and\n  * alkaline phosphatase must be ≤ 2.5 x ULN for the lab; and\n  * AST and ALT must be ≤ 1.5 x ULN for the lab.\n* Patients with AST or ALT or alkaline phosphatase > ULN are eligible for inclusion in the study if liver imaging (CT, MRI, abdominal ultrasound, PET-CT, or PET scan) performed within 28 days prior to randomization does not demonstrate metastatic disease and the requirements in criterion (just above) are met.\n* Patients with alkaline phosphatase that is > ULN but less than or equal to 2.5 x ULN or with unexplained bone pain are eligible for inclusion in the study if bone imaging (bone scan, PET-CT scan, or PET scan) supported by additional studies when indicated (CT, x-ray, MRI) performed within 28 days prior to randomization does not demonstrate metastatic disease.\n* Patients with N2 or N3 nodal disease or T3 primary disease must undergo liver and bone imaging (as described in 4.1.13 and 4.1.14) within 28 days prior to randomization, irrespective of baseline lab results, and studies must not demonstrate metastatic disease. Chest imaging with chest x-ray PA and Lateral, CT of the chest, or PET-CT must also be performed.\n* Creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min (see Section 7.2.1 for instructions regarding calculation of creatinine clearance) performed within 28 days prior to randomization.\n* PT/INR ≤ ULN within 28 days of randomization. Patients receiving therapeutic anti-coagulants are not eligible.\n* A serum TSH and AM (morning) cortisol performed within 28 days prior to randomization to obtain a baseline value. Patients with abnormal TSH or AM cortisol baseline levels should be further evaluated and managed per institutional standards. Asymptomatic patients who require initiation or adjustment of medication or are followed without initiating treatment based on endocrinologist's recommendations are eligible.\n* LVEF assessment must be performed within 42 days prior to randomization. (LVEF assessment performed by echocardiogram is preferred; however, MUGA scan may be substituted based on institutional preferences.) The LVEF must be ≥ 55% regardless of the cardiac imaging facility's lower limit of normal.\n* For women of childbearing potential: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive methods that result in a failure rate of < 1% per year during the treatment period and for at least 5 months after the last dose of atezolizumab/placebo or 12 months after the last dose of chemotherapy.\n\n  * A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is not postmenopausal, has not reached a postmenopausal state (≥ 12 continuous months of amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone surgical sterilization (removal of ovaries and/or uterus).\n  * Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of < 1% per year include: bilateral tubal ligation; male partner sterilization; hormonal contraceptives that inhibit ovulation; hormone-releasing intrauterine devices; copper intrauterine devices.\n  * The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.\n* Patient must be willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plans, laboratory tests, and other study procedures.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
