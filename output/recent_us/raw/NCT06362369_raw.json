Women/men of reproductive potential must have agreed to use an effective contraceptive method. A woman is considered to be of \"reproductive potential\" if she has had menses at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months. In addition to routine contraceptive methods, \"effective contraception\" also includes heterosexual celibacy and surgery intended to prevent pregnancy (or with a side-effect of pregnancy prevention) defined as a hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral tubal ligation. However, if at any point a previously celibate patient chooses to become heterosexually active during the time period for use of contraceptive measures outlined in the protocol, he/she is responsible for beginning contraceptive measures\n* Patients must not have an active infection requiring systemic therapy\n* Patient must not have liver dysfunctions manifested by either (1) Child-Pugh B (or worse) or (2) cirrhosis (any degree) and a history of hepatic encephalopathy or clinically meaningful ascites resulting from cirrhosis. Clinically meaningful ascites is defined as ascites from cirrhosis requiring diuretics or paracentesis\n* Patients must not have a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), or any other significant thromboembolism (venous port or catheter thrombosis or superficial venous thrombosis are not considered \"significant\") during the 90 days prior to registration\n* Patients must not have experienced any arterial thrombotic event (including but not limited to myocardial infarction, unstable angina, stable angina markedly limiting ordinary physical activity, cerebrovascular accident, or transient ischemic attack) within 120 days prior to registration\n* Patients must not have a prior history of gastrointestinal (GI) perforation/fistula or other risk factors for perforation within 120 days prior to registration\n* Patients must not have experienced any grade 3-4 GI bleeding within 90 days prior to registration\n* Patient must not have experienced any serious or non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture within 28 days prior to registration",
