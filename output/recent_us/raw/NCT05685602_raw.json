Treatment with systemic corticosteroids within 2 weeks prior to the start of the treatment. Patients that require inhaled or low-dose corticosteroids for COPD or asthma, mineralocorticoids are allowed.\n7. Patients with active malignancies in addition to urothelial carcinoma.\n8. Patients with prior treatment with hypomethylating agents.\n9. History of leptomeningeal disease\n10. Prior allogeneic stem cell or solid organ transplant.\n11.

Mean QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) ≥ 470ms calculated from 3 ECGs using Frediricia's correction.\n14. Any prior Grade ≥3 immune-related adverse event (irAE) while receiving any previous immunotherapy agent, or any unresolved irAE >Grade 1 except for endocrine AEs managed with replacement therapy.

Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n23.
