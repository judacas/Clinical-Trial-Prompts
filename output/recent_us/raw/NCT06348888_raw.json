HIV testing is not required for eligibility for this protocol. This exclusion criteria is necessary because the treatments involved in this protocol may be significantly immunosuppressive\n* Previous chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 2 weeks prior to registration or patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to previous chemotherapy and radiotherapy\n* Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.
