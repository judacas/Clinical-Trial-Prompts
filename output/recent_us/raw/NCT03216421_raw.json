    "inclusion_criteria": "* ≥ 12 years of age at the time of informed consent.\n* New-onset moderate or severe cGVHD, as defined by the 2014 NIH Consensus Development Project Criteria for Clinical Trials in cGVHD, requiring systemic therapy.\n* History of 1 allo-SCT (any type of stem cell donor, any conditioning regimen, and source of hematopoietic stem cells).\n* Adequate hematologic function independent of platelet transfusion and growth factors for at least 7 days prior to study entry: ANC ≥ 0.75 × 109/L and platelet count ≥ 20 × 109/L.\n* Willingness to avoid pregnancy or fathering children.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 12 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Received more than 1 prior allo-SCT. Prior autologous HCT is allowed.\n* Has overlap cGVHD, defined as simultaneous presence of features or characteristics of aGVHD in a patient with cGVHD.\n* Received previous systemic treatment for cGVHD, including systemic corticosteroids and extracorporeal photopheresis.\n* Received systemic corticosteroids within 2 weeks prior to C1D1, regardless of indication.\n* Initiated systemic treatment with CNIs or mTOR inhibitors within 2 weeks prior to C1D1.\n* Prior treatment with a JAK inhibitor within 8 weeks before randomization. Participants who received a JAK inhibitor for the treatment of aGVHD are eligible only if they achieved a response (CR or PR) to JAK inhibitor treatment and did not discontinue due to toxicity.\n* Evidence of relapse of the primary hematologic disease or treatment for relapse after the allo-SCT was performed, including DLIs for the treatment of molecular relapse.\n* History of acute or chronic pancreatitis.\n* History of thromboembolic events (such as deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, stroke, myocardial infarction) in the 6 months prior to study entry.\n* Active symptomatic myositis.\n* Severe renal impairment, that is, estimated CrCl < 30 mL/min measured or calculated by Cockcroft-Gault equation in adults and Schwartz formula in pediatric participants, or end-stage renal disease on dialysis. Participants with CrCl of 30 to 59 mL/min on treatment with fluconazole are not eligible.\n* Impaired liver function, defined as total bilirubin > 1.5 × ULN and/or ALT and AST > 3 × ULN in participants with no evidence of liver cGVHD.\n* Currently active significant cardiac disease, such as uncontrolled arrhythmias, uncontrolled hypertension, or Class 3 or 4 congestive heart failure as defined by New York Heart Association, or a history of myocardial infarction or unstable angina within 6 months prior to randomization.\n* Pregnant or breastfeeding.\n\nOther protocol-defined Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria may apply.",
