Subjects with any other diseases that the Investigator determines will affect the study results or may weaken the compliance to protocol, including but not limited to:\n\n   1.

Other documented autoimmune diseases (such as hepatitis, immune thrombocytopenia [ITP], scleroderma, psoriasis, or any autoimmune arthritis)\n   3. Clinically significant pulmonary infiltration, infectious pneumonia, and non-infectious pneumonia, or a past history of interstitial pneumonia at screening\n   4. Active infection with systemic manifestations (e.g., presence of bacteria, fungi, and/or human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] at screening, excluding hepatitis B [HBV] and/or hepatitis C [HCV] at screening)\n   5. Evidence of severe retinopathy (e.g., cytomegalovirus [CMV]-induced retinitis, macular degeneration) or clinically significant eye diseases (due to diabetes or hypertension)\n   6. History or presence of clinically relevant depression per Investigator's judgment\n   7. Previously had suicidal attempts or has any risk for suicidal tendency at screening\n   8. Poorly controlled diabetes defined as HbA1c >8.0% for at least 1 year\n   9. Active thromboembolic complications caused by PV and abdominal hemorrhage in the active phase\n   10.

History of alcohol or drug abuse in the past year\n   12. History or evidence of post-polycythemia vera-myelofibrosis (PPV-MF), essential thrombocythemia, or any non-PV MPN\n   13. Presence of blast cells in the peripheral blood in the past 12 weeks\n7. Use any investigational drug <4 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug, or not recovered from effects of prior administration of any investigational drug\n8.
