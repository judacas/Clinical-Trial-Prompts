Has a tumor(s) with PD-L1 combined positive score (CPS) ≥10 and is considered ineligible to receive cisplatin-based combination therapy, based on 1 of the following:\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) score of 2 within 7 days prior to randomization\n* National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.0 Grade ≥2 audiometric hearing loss\n* NCI CTCAE Version 4.0 Grade ≥2 peripheral neuropathy OR\n* b. In the opinion of the investigator, is considered ineligible to receive any platinum-based chemotherapy (i.e., ineligible for cisplatin and carboplatin) based on:\n* ECOG PS of 2 within 7 days prior to randomization and ≥1 of the following:\n* Documented visceral metastatic disease\n* NCI CTCAE Version 4.0 Grade ≥2 audiometric hearing loss\n* NCI CTCAE Version 4.0 Grade ≥2 peripheral neuropathy\n* Other reason for the participant's being unable to receive both cisplatin and carboplatin safely. Additional criteria for platinum ineligibility will be considered and allowed on a case-by-case basis, following consultation with the Sponsor. Note: Participants considered ineligible for any platinum-based chemotherapy are eligible for this study regardless of their tumor PD-L1 status.\n* Has ECOG PS 0, 1, or 2 within 7 days prior to randomization and a life expectancy of ≥3 months.\n* Male participants are eligible to participate if they agree to the following during the treatment period and for ≥30 days after the last dose of pembrolizumab or lenvatinib/placebo:\n* Be abstinent from heterosexual intercourse as their preferred and usual lifestyle and agree to remain abstinent, OR\n* Must agree to use contraception unless confirmed to be azoospermic (vasectomized or secondary to medical cause as detailed below:\n* Agrees to use a male condom plus partner use of an additional contraceptive method when having penile-vaginal intercourse with a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) who is not currently pregnant. Note: Men with a pregnant or breastfeeding partner must agree to remain abstinent from penile-vaginal intercourse or use a male condom during each episode of penile-vaginal penetration.\n* A female participant is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant or breastfeeding and if she is not a WOCBP OR is a WOCBP and is using a contraceptive method that is highly effective (with a failure rate of <1% per year) with low user dependency, or is abstinent from heterosexual intercourse as her preferred and usual lifestyle during the intervention period and for ≥120 days post pembrolizumab or ≥30 days post lenvatinib/placebo.\n* Has adequately controlled blood pressure (BP) with or without antihypertensive medications, defined as BP ≤150/90 mm Hg at screening and no change in antihypertensive medications within 1 week prior to randomization.\n* Has adequate organ function.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Has disease that is suitable for local therapy administered with curative intent (e.g. chemotherapy and radiation for Stage 3 disease).\n* Has tumor with any neuroendocrine or small cell component.\n* Has a history of a gastrointestinal condition or procedure (e.g. gastric bypass, malabsorption) that, in the opinion of the investigator, may affect oral drug absorption.\n* Has had major surgery within 3 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment\n* Has a pre-existing Grade ≥3 gastrointestinal or non-gastrointestinal fistula.\n* Has radiographic evidence of major blood vessel invasion/infiltration, or has had clinically significant hemoptysis (≥0.5 teaspoon of bright red blood) or tumor bleeding within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment.\n* Has had significant cardiovascular impairment within 12 months of the first dose of study treatment, such as history of New York Heart Association (NYHA) >Class II congestive heart failure, unstable angina, myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident (CVA)/stroke, cardiac revascularization procedure, or cardiac arrhythmia associated with hemodynamic instability.\n* Has known intolerance or severe hypersensitivity (Grade ≥3) to pembrolizumab or lenvatinib or any of their excipients\n* Has received lenvatinib as monotherapy or in combination with a programmed cell death-1/programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) inhibitor or has previously been enrolled in a clinical study evaluating lenvatinib for bladder cancer, regardless of the treatment received.\n* Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 inhibitor, indoleamine-pyrrole 2,3 dioxygenase (IDO1) inhibitor, or agent directed to another stimulatory or co-inhibitory T-cell receptor (e.g. cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 [CTLA-4], OX 40, CD137), or any other antibody or drug targeting T-cell costimulatory pathways in the adjuvant or advanced/metastatic setting.\n* Has received prior radiotherapy to a metastatic site without the use of chemotherapy radiosensitization within 3 weeks of the first dose of study treatment, with the exception of palliative radiotherapy to bone lesions, which is allowed if completed 2 weeks before the start of study treatment.
