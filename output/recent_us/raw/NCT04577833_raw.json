    "official_title": "Use of a Proliferation Saturation Index to Determine Personalized Radiotherapy Fractionation for Patients With HPV+ Oropharyngeal Cancers",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Stated willingness to comply with all study procedures and availability for the duration of the study\n* Male or female, aged â‰¥ 18 years\n* Pathologically (histologically or cytologically) proven diagnosis of p16+ or HPV+ squamous cell carcinoma (including the histological variants papillary squamous cell carcinoma and basaloid squamous cell carcinoma) of the oropharynx; cytologic diagnosis from a cervical lymph node is sufficient in the presence of clinical evidence of a primary tumor in the oropharynx. Clinical evidence should be documented, and may consist of pathology, palpation, imaging, or endoscopic evaluation, and should be sufficient to estimate the size of the primary (for T stage).\n* American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 8th edition staging T1-3 N0-1 MO\n* Patients must have clinically or radiographically evident measurable disease at the primary site or at nodal stations.\n* CT or MRI performed at least 1 week apart. This can consist of diagnostic imaging and radiation therapy planning imaging.\n* No evidence of distant metastases\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status 0 to 3\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Age < 18\n* Positive urine pregnancy test\n* Evidence of distant metastases\n* Gross total excision of both primary and nodal disease; this includes tonsillectomy, local excision of primary site, and nodal excision that remove all clinically and radiographically evident disease\n* Prior radiotherapy to the region of the study cancer that would result in overlap of radiation therapy fields\n* Patients with a medical condition or social situation that at the discretion of the PI would preclude them from completion of the trial",
