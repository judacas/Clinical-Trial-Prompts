    "official_title": "Focal Laser Ablation of Prostate Cancer: A Feasibility Study Using MRI/US Image Fusion for Guidance",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Subjects with organ-confined prostate cancer (clinical stage ≤ T2b, Gleason =7)\n* Age 40 to 85 years of age\n* Multi-parametric MRI read at study site within 9 months of study treatment, demonstrating a Region of interest (ROI) of MRI (PIRADSv2 > Grade 3)1\n* Prostate volume 20cc to 80cc\n* MRI/ultrasound fusion biopsy with ≥ 10 systematic biopsy cores and ≥ 2 targeted biopsy cores from above MRI-derived ROI within 6 months of study treatment*\n* Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma from targeted biopsy cores\n* Overall Gleason = 3+4 or 4+3\n* Subjects desire focal therapy and decline conventional treatment (active surveillance, radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy, cryosurgery, and hormone therapy)\n* Treatment plan that allows for treatment of lesion while still maintaining a 4mm safety margin from the rectal wall and urethra\n* Signed informed consent for the FLA treatment through follow-up per study protocol\n\n  * For subjects under consideration for repeat FLA, the post-treatment MRI and biopsies done at Months 6 and 12 study visits may be used for these criteria.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be MALE\nMust have minimum age of 40 Years\nMust have maximum age of 85 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Any significant cancer outside of the intended treatment zone, defined as Gleason score ≥ 7\n* < 10 years life expectancy\n* Any medical condition that would compromise the subject's ability to safely participate in the study\n* Active bleeding disorder\n* Use of coumadin or any other anticoagulant, unless anticoagulation can be temporarily reversed or stopped for a window of at least 7 days peri-procedure\n* Use of aspirin, unless it can be temporarily stopped for a window of at least 14 days prior to FLA procedure\n* Use of NSAIDS (except aspirin), Vitamin E, multivitamins, and herbal products, unless they can be temporarily stopped for at least 7 days prior to FLA procedure\n* Active urinary tract infection\n* Active prostate abscess, prostatitis, or neurogenic bladder\n* Any prior treatment for prostate cancer, including:\n\n  * Radical prostatectomy\n  * Radiation therapy (external beam or brachytherapy)\n  * Cryotherapy\n  * High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) treatment\n  * Photodynamic therapy\n  * Androgen deprivation therapy\n  * Focal Laser Ablation (acceptable for enrolled subjects under consideration for repeat FLA)\n* Prior prostate, bladder neck, or urethral stricture surgery\n* Any prostate debulking procedure, including transurethral resection of prostate, photovaporization, or electrovaporization\n* Transurethral incision of bladder neck\n* Urethral stricture dilation or reconstruction\n* Use of 5-alpha reductase inhibitors within 6 months of treatment\n* Prior significant rectal surgery (hemorrhoidectomy is acceptable)\n* Active rectal fissure, fibrosis, stenosis, or other anatomic abnormality precluding insertion of transrectal device\n* Active inflammatory bowel disease\n* Urinary tract or rectal fistula\n* Previous urethral sling, artificial urinary sphincter, or penile prosthesis surgery.\n* Any contraindication to MRI (contrast allergy, severe claustrophobia, MRI-incompatible prosthesis, MRI-unsafe aneurysm clips)",
