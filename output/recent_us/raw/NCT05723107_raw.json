    "official_title": "Phase II Trial of LB100, a Protein Phosphatase 2A Inhibitor, in Recurrent Glioblastoma",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* INCLUSION CRITERIA:\n* Patients must have histologically confirmed glioblastoma/gliosarcoma, grades II-III astrocytoma and oligodendroglioma.\n* Patients must have recurrent disease for which there is a clinical indication for resection.\n* Age greater than or equal to18 years.\n* Karnofsky greater than or equal to 60%.\n* Patients must have adequate bone marrow function (white blood count (WBC) greater than or equal to 3,000/uL absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 1,500/mm^3, platelet count of greater than or equal to 100,000/mm^3, and hemoglobin greater than or equal to 10 gm/dL), adequate liver function (SGOT and bilirubin < 2 times upper limit of normal (ULN). These tests must be performed within 28 days prior to receiving drug. Eligibility level for hemoglobin may be reached by transfusion.\n* Patients must have a serum creatinine of <=1.7 mg/dL. If the serum creatinine is greater than 1.7 mg/dl, a 24-hour urine creatinine clearance will be obtained and if the result of this study is within normal limits*, the patient would be eligible to enroll onto study. This test must be performed within 28 days prior to registrationreceiving drug. (*Normal Creatinine Clearance Range: Male: 90 - 130 ml/min; Female: 80 - 125 ml/min)\n* Patients must be in adequate general medical health to safely tolerate a craniotomy.\n* At the time of registration, all subjects must be removed greater than or equal to 28 days from any investigational agents.\n* The effects of LB100 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.\n* Ability of subject to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document indicating that they are aware of the investigational nature of this study, and that this is not a therapeutic clinical trial.\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\n* Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* Patients unwilling to undergo craniotomy.\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the safety of Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibition on a developing fetus has not been established. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with LB100, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with LB100.\n* Patients may not have had prior chemotherapy or biologic therapy in the 4 weeks prior to study entry. For patients who have been treated with targeted therapy, 5 half-lives of that therapy (or 28 days, whichever is shorter) must have passed prior to enrollment in the study.\n* Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with LB100. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.\n* Patients who are receiving strong cytochromes P450 (CYP450) inducers or inhibitors are ineligible\n* Recruitment Strategies\n\nPatients with recurrent disease will be identified by the Neuro-Oncology Branch, Clinical Center. This study will be posted on National Institutes of Health (NIH) websites and on NIH Social media forums.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
