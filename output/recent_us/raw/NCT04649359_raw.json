    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Must provide written informed consent prior to initiating any trial related procedures.\n2. Patient must be ≥ 18 years of age\n3. Patient has histologically confirmed (if tumor tissue is unavailable, documentation of diagnosis from original biopsy is acceptable) or clinically diagnosed (American Association for the Study of Liver Disease criteria in cirrhotic subjects) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).\n4. Patient has resectable disease with no evidence of extrahepatic spread. The determination of resectability status will ultimately lie in the clinical judgment of the surgical oncologist and medical oncologist involved in the care of the patient.\n5. Must have a Child-Turcotte-Pugh score of A\n6. Patients must have at least one measurable site of disease per RECIST version 1.1(Appendix 4) or Immune- Modified RECIST. This is defined as a lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension and measures a minimum of ≥ 10 mm (longest diameter to be recorded) with US, MRI or Spiral CT.\n7. Patient has record of treated (as necessary per local SoC guidelines) or absent esophageal varices by esophagogastroduodenoscopy within 6 months of initiating treatment.\n8. Patient must be willing to undergopretreatment research biopsy to provide a tumor sample for exploratory biomarker research.\n9. ECOG (Eastern Oncology Cooperative Group) performance status 0-1.\n10. Patient demonstrates adequate organ and marrow function within 14 days of studydrug administration:\n\n    * Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 × 109/L (1500/µL)\n    * Lymphocyte count ≥ 0.5 × 109/L (500/µL)\n    * Platelet count ≥ 75 × 109/L (75,000/µL) without transfusion\n    * Hemoglobin ≥ 90 g/L (9 g/dL)\n    * Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase ALP) ≤ 5 × upper limit of normal (ULN)\n    * Serum bilirubin ≤ 3 × ULN\n    * Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × ULN\n    * Serum albumin ≥ 28 g/L (2.8 g/dL)\n    * International normalized ratio (INR) or activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) ≤ 2 × ULN\n11. Negative human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) test at screening\n12. UA with protein less than 2+. Patients discovered to have ≥2+ proteinuria on dipstick urinalysis at baseline should undergo a 24-hour urine collection and must demonstrate <1g of protein in 24 hours.\n13. Documented virology status of hepatitis, as confirmed by screening HBV and HCV tests. For patients with active HBV: HBV DNA <500 IU/mL during screening, initiation of anti-HBV treatment at least 14 days prior to first dose and willingness to continue anti-HBV treatment during the study (per local standard of care; e.g., entecavir)\n14. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) and men with partners of child bearing potential agree to prevent pregnancy using two forms of contraception from the date of Informed Consent through 6 months after the last dose of study drug. A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarchal, has not reached a postmenopausal state (≥ 12 continuous months of amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone surgical sterilization (removal of ovaries, fallopian tubes and/or uterus) or another cause as determined by the investigator (e.g., Müllerian agenesis). Per this definition, a woman with a tubal ligation is considered to be of childbearing potential. The definition of childbearing potential may be adapted for alignment with local guidelines or requirements.\n15. Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of < 1% per year include bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, hormonal contraceptives that inhibit ovulation, hormone-releasing intrauterine devices, and copper intrauterine devices. The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not adequate methods of contraception. WOCBP potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test result within 14 days of initiating study treatment\n16. WOCB must not be breastfeeding.\n17. For men: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use a condom, and agreement to refrain from donating sperm, as defined below: With a female partner of childbearing potential or pregnant female partner, men must remain abstinent or use a condom during the treatment period and for 6 months after the final dose of study medication to avoid exposing the embryo. Men must refrain from donating sperm during this same period. The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not adequate methods of preventing drug exposure. If required per local guidelines or regulations, information about the reliability of abstinence will be described in the local Informed Consent Form.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
