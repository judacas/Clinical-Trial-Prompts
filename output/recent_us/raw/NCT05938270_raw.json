    "official_title": "Bronchoscopy With and Without Needle-based Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy for Peripheral Lung Nodule Diagnosis: Protocol for a Multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial (CLEVER Trial)",
    "inclusion_criteria": "1. ≥18 years of age\n2. Suspected malignant peripheral lung lesion with an indication for a bronchoscopic diagnostic work-up as determined by the attending physician or tumor board. Peripheral pulmonary lesions are defined as lesions located beyond the visible segmental bronchi, not detectable by regular flexible bronchoscopy\n3. Bronchus sign on pre-procedural CT or estimated confidence for successful navigation to the nodule resulting in a r-EBUS signal\n4. Solid part of the lesion must be ≧10 mm\n5. Largest dimension of lesion size on CT ≦30 mm (long-axis)\n6. Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Inability or non-willingness to provide informed consent\n2. Endobronchial visible malignancy on bronchoscopic inspection\n3. Target lesion within reach of the linear EBUS scope\n4. Failure to comply with the study protocol\n5. Known allergy or risk factors for an allergic reaction to fluorescein\n6. Pregnancy or breastfeeding\n7. Hemodynamic instability\n8. Refractory hypoxemia\n9. Therapeutic anticoagulant use that cannot be withheld for an appropriate interval before the procedure\n10. Unable to tolerate general anesthesia according to the anesthesiologist\n11. Undergoing chemotherapy as several chemotherapies have fluorescent properties at the same wavelength (e.g., doxorubicin)",
