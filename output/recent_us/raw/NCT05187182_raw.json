    "inclusion_criteria": "* Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastroesophageal junction (GEA). Other GE histologies which are treated per NCCN guidelines for neoadjuvant treatment are eligible.\n* Must have Stage IB, II or Stage III GEA eligible for (neo)adjuvant doublet or triplet chemotherapy for up to 6 months.\n* Must have baseline ctDNA positive assay (tested by Signatera MRD assay) prior to initiation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Patients who are otherwise eligible may start per protocol treatment if ctDNA result is not available at the time of initiation of systemic therapy. However, once the results is available, they can only remain on study if the ctDNA is positive.\n* Age ≥ 18 years Because the safety or efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for LGEA has not been tested or established for patients <18 years of age, children are excluded from this study but will be eligible for future pediatric trials, if applicable.\n* Performance status: ECOG performance status ≤2\n* Life expectancy of greater than 6 months\n* Adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:\n\n  1. leukocytes ≥ 3,000/mcL\n  2. absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcL\n  3. platelets ≥ 80,000/mcl\n  4. total bilirubin within normal institutional limits\n  5. AST(SGOT)/ALT(SPGT) ≤ 5 X institutional upper limit of normal\n  6. creatinine <2 X ULN\n* Docetaxel can cause fetal harm and irinotecan is known to be teratogenic. Since these compounds are part of the treatment regimens, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for 90 days following completion of therapy. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.\n\n  1.
