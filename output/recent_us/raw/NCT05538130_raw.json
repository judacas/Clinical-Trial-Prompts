    "official_title": "A Phase 3, Randomized, Multi-center, Open-label Study of Trastuzumab Deruxtecan (T-DXd) Versus Investigator's Choice Chemotherapy in HER2-Low, Hormone Receptor Positive Breast Cancer Patients Whose Disease Has Progressed on Endocrine Therapy in the Metastatic Setting (DESTINY-Breast06)",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Patients must be ≥18 years of age\n* Pathologically documented breast cancer that:\n\n  1. is advanced or metastatic\n  2. has a history of HER2-low or negative expression by local test, defined as IHC 2+/ISH- or IHC 1+ (ISH- or untested) or HER2 IHC 0 (ISH- or untested)\n  3. has HER2-low or HER2 IHC >0 <1+ expression as determined by the central laboratory result established on a tissue sample taken in the metastatic setting\n  4. was never previously HER2-positive\n  5. is documented HR+ disease in the metastatic setting.\n* No prior chemotherapy for advanced or metastatic breast cancer.\n* Has adequate tumor samples for assessment of HER2 status\n* Must have either:\n\n  1. disease progression within 6 months of starting first line metastatic treatment with an endocrine therapy combined with a CDK4/6 inhibitor or\n  2. disease progression on at least 2 previous lines of endocrine therapy with or without a targeted therapy in the metastatic setting. Of note with regards to the ≥2 lines of previous ET requirement: disease recurrence while on the first 24 months of starting adjuvant ET, will be considered a line of therapy; these patients will only require 1 line of ET in the metastatic setting.\n* Has protocol-defined adequate organ and bone marrow function\n\nKey\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 105 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Ineligible for all options in the investigator's choice chemotherapy arm\n* Lung-specific intercurrent clinically significant illnesses\n* Uncontrolled or significant cardiovascular disease or infection\n* Prior documented interstitial lung disease (ILD)/ pneumonitis that required steroids, current ILD/ pneumonitis, or suspected ILD/ pneumonitis that cannot be ruled out by imaging at screening.\n* Patients with spinal cord compression or clinically active central nervous system metastases\n* Prior randomization or treatment in a previous trastuzumab deruxtecan study regardless of treatment arm assignment\n* Concurrent enrolment in another clinical study, unless it is an observational (non-interventional) clinical study during the follow up period of a prior interventional study (prescreening for this study while a patient is on treatment in another clinical study is acceptable)",
