Ability to understand and willingness to sign informed consent form prior to the initiation of study and any study procedures.\n\n    1. Participants with cognitive impairment may be enrolled. The formal consent for such participants will be obtained from their legally authorized representative. However, participants will be informed about the research to the maximum extent compatible with their understanding. Assent will be obtained from such participants who will sign and date the consent form if capable.\n    2.
