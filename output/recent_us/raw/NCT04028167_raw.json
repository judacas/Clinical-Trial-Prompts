Men with female partners who are of childbearing potential must agree that they will use a highly effective method of contraception from the time of giving informed consent until at least 16 weeks after the patient receives his last dose of loncastuximab tesirine.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Previous treatment with loncastuximab tesirine\n* Known history of hypersensitivity to or positive serum human ADA to a CD19 antibody\n* Pathologic diagnosis of Burkitt lymphoma\n* Active second primary malignancy other than non-melanoma skin cancers, non-metastatic prostate cancer, in situ cervical cancer, ductal or lobular carcinoma in situ of the breast, or other malignancy that the Sponsor's medical monitor and Investigator agree and document should not be exclusionary\n* Autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) within 30 days prior to start of study drug (C1D1)\n* Allogeneic stem cell transplant (AlloSCT) within 60 days prior to start of study drug (C1D1)\n* Active graft-versus-host disease\n* Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders\n* Active autoimmune disease, including motor neuropathy considered of autoimmune origin and other central nervous system (CNS) autoimmune disease\n* Known seropositive and requiring anti-viral therapy for human immunodeficiency (HIV) virus, hepatitis B virus (HBV), or hepatitis C virus (HCV).\n* History of Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis\n* Lymphoma with active CNS involvement at the time of screening, including leptomeningeal disease\n* Clinically significant third space fluid accumulation (i.e., ascites requiring drainage or pleural effusion that is either requiring drainage or associated with shortness of breath)\n* Breastfeeding or pregnant\n* Significant medical comorbidities\n* Major surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy or other anti-neoplastic therapy within 14 days prior to start of study drug (C1D1), except shorter if approved by the Sponsor\n* Use of any other experimental medication within 14 days prior to start of study drug (C1D1)\n* Planned live vaccine administration after starting study drug (C1D1)\n* Failure to recover to Grade ≤1 (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 [CTCAE v4.0]) from acute non-hematologic toxicity (Grade ≤2 neuropathy or alopecia) due to previous therapy prior to screening\n* Congenital long QT syndrome or a corrected QTcF interval of >480 ms at screening (unless secondary to pacemaker or bundle branch block)\n* Any other significant medical illness, abnormality, or condition that would, in the Investigator's judgment, make the patient inappropriate for study participation or put the patient at risk",
