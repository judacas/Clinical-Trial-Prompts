The treated participants must have completed their treatment at least 1 month prior to starting study intervention and HCV viral load must be below the limit of quantification.\n* Participants with controlled HBV will be eligible if they meet the following criteria:\n\n  * Antiviral therapy for HBV must be given for at least 4 weeks and HBV viral load must be less than 500 IU/mL prior to first dose of study drug. Patients on active HBV therapy with viral loads under 100 IU/mL should stay on the same therapy throughout study intervention.\n  * Patients who are positive for anti-hepatitis B core antibody HBc, negative for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and negative or positive for anti-hepatitis B surface antibody (HBs), and who have an HBV viral load under 100 IU/mL, do not require HBV antiviral prophylaxis.\n  * Patients must have adequately controlled blood pressure (BP) with or without antihypertensive medications, defined as BP ≤ 150/90 mm Hg at Screening and no change in antihypertensive medications within 1 week before Cycle 1 Day 1.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Known fibrolamellar HCC, sarcomatoid HCC, or mixed cholangiocarcinoma and HCC.\n* Patients receiving therapy with other anti-neoplastic or experimental agents\n* Patients receiving concomitant strong inhibitors of CYP3A4/5 that cannot be discontinued 7 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to Cycle 1 Day 1.\n* Patients receiving concomitant inducers of CYP3A4/5 that cannot be discontinued at least 14 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1.\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to tegavivint, or other agents used in study\n* Malignant disease, other than that being treated in this study. Note: Patients with basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or carcinoma in situ (e.g., breast carcinoma, cervical cancer in situ) who have undergone potentially curative therapy are not excluded. Other exceptions include malignancies that were treated curatively and have not recurred within 3 years prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 and any malignancy considered indolent and that has never required therapy.\n* Lack of peripheral venous or central venous access or any condition that would interfere with drug administration or collection of study samples\n* Known central nervous system (CNS) involvement\n* Uncontrolled concurrent illness including, but not limited to:\n\n  * Ongoing or active infection (exception: HBV infection - see inclusion criteria)\n  * Unhealed wounds or presence of any external drainage\n  * Psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements; discuss with Medical Monitor if there are any questions\n* Clinically significant, uncontrolled heart disease and/or cardiac repolarization abnormality, including any of the following:\n\n  * Congestive heart failure, NYHA > Class II\n  * Left ventricular ejection fraction < 50%\n  * Unstable angina pectoris or cardiac arrhythmia\n  * Baseline QTc (Fridericia) ≥ 450 milliseconds. In the event a QTc (Fridericia) measurement is not possible due to factors such as a pacemaker or bundle branch block, the patient may be evaluated by a cardiologist who must document no apparent increased risk for Torsades de Point or other morbidity associated with prolonged QTc. With such documentation, the patient may be eligible based with additional Medical Monitor review.\n  * Long QT syndrome or family history of idiopathic sudden death or congenital long QT syndrome\n  * Myocardial infarct within 6 months before Cycle 1 Day 1\n  * Clinically significant pericardial disease\n* Any major surgery within 21 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1. Major surgery is defined as any significantly invasive procedure into a major body cavity (abdomen, cranium etc.) and/or surgery requiring extensive recuperation (joint replacement). Please discuss with the Medical Monitor if there are any questions.\n* Pregnant and breastfeeding women are excluded from this study. The effects of tegavivint on the developing human fetus have the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. There is an unknown but potential risk for AEs in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with tegavivint\n* Women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) and men who are sexually active with WOCBP must agree to use one highly effective method of contraception, including hormonal contraceptives (e.g. combined oral contraceptives, patch, vaginal ring, injectables, and implants); intrauterine device or intrauterine system; vasectomy or tubal ligation; and one effective method of contraception, including male condom, female condom, cervical cap, diaphragm or contraceptive sponge or abstaining from sex for the duration of study participation and for at least 4 months following completion of tegavivint and pembrolizumab (if applicable) administration. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.\n* HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for PK interactions with tegavivint.\n* Exclusions for patients treated on study with pembrolizumab:\n\n  * Have received a live vaccine or live-attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug. Administration of killed vaccines is allowed.\n  * Have a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or are receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy (in dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug.\n  * Have active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e., with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment and is allowed.\n  * Have a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease that required steroids or have current pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease.\n  * Prior allogeneic organ or bone marrow transplant",
