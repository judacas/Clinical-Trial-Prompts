    "exclusion_criteria": "* Has received prior systemic anti-cancer therapy for the current diagnosis of inflammatory breast cancer, including chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or targeted therapy\n* Has received any radiotherapy or surgery for the current diagnosis of inflammatory breast cancer. Tumor biopsies are not considered surgery for the purpose of enrollment.\n* Prior hypersensitivity to durvalumab or the excipients of durvalumab or trastuzumab deruxtecan or history of severe hypersensitivity reactions to other monoclonal antibodies.\n* Major surgery within 4 weeks prior to study treatment initiation. Patients must have recovered from any effects of any major surgery.\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness, including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina pectoris, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, serious chronic gastrointestinal conditions associated with diarrhea, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements, substantially increase risk of incurring AEs, or compromise the ability of the patient to give written informed consent.\n* Participant has a medical condition that requires chronic systemic steroid therapy (> 10 mg of prednisone daily or equivalent) or any other form of immunosuppressive medication (including disease modifying agents) and has required such therapy in the last 2 years. Replacement therapy (e.g. thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic therapy.\n* Active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders (including inflammatory bowel disease [eg, colitis or Crohn's disease], diverticulitis [with the exception of diverticulosis], systemic lupus erythematosus, sarcoidosis syndrome, Wegener syndrome [granulomatosis with polyangiitis], Graves' disease, and rheumatoid arthritis, hypophysitis, uveitis, etc). The following are exceptions to this criterion:\n\n  -- Patients with vitiligo or alopecia, Patients with hypothyroidism (eg, following Hashimoto syndrome) stable on hormone replacement, Patients with any chronic skin condition that does not require systemic therapy, Patients with celiac disease controlled by diet alone, who may also be included, but only after consultation with the Principal Investigator, Patients without active disease in the last 5 years, who may also be included but only after consultation with the Principal Investigator\n* History of (non-infectious) ILD/pneumonitis that required steroids, has current ILD/pneumonitis, or where suspected ILD/pneumonitis cannot be ruled out by imaging at screening.\n* Lung-specific intercurrent clinically significant illnesses including, but not limited to, any underlying pulmonary disorder (ie, pulmonary emboli within 3 months of the study enrollment, severe asthma, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), restrictive lung disease, pleural effusion etc.), and any autoimmune, connective tissue or inflammatory disorders with pulmonary involvement (ie, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren's syndrome, sarcoidosis etc.), and prior pneumonectomy\n* Corrected QT interval (QTcF) prolongation to > 470 msec on screening EKG\n* Any factors that increase the risk of QTc prolongation or risk of arrhythmic events, such as heart failure, hypokalemia, potential for torsades de pointes, congenital long QT syndrome, family history of long QT syndrome or unexplained sudden death under 40 years of age, or any concomitant medication known to prolong the QT interval\n* Any of the following procedures or conditions in the 6 months prior to enrollment: coronary artery bypass graft, angioplasty, vascular stent, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association Functional Classification Grade ≥2), and stroke. Subjects with troponin levels above ULN at screening (as defined by the manufacturer), and without any myocardial infarction related symptoms, should have a cardiology consultation before enrollment to rule out myocardial infarction.\n* Cardiac ejection fraction outside institutional range of normal or <50% (whichever is higher) as measured by echocardiogram (or multiple-gated acquisition [MUGA] scan if an echocardiogram cannot be performed or is inconclusive).\n* History of another primary malignancy, except for Malignancy treated with curative intent and with no known active disease ≥5 years before the first dose of study treatment and of low potential risk for recurrence.

Patients with a past or resolved HBV infection (defined as the presence of hepatitis B core antibody [anti-HBc] and absence of HBsAg) are eligible. Patients positive for hepatitis C antibody are eligible only if the polymerase chain reaction is negative for HCV RNA. Some medications used for these conditions have drug-drug interactions with the study treatment.\n* Known to have previously tested positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (positive HIV 1/2 antibodies)(HIV testing is not required for participation on this study)\n* Receipt of a live vaccine within 30 days prior to study treatment initiation. Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster, yellow fever, rabies, BCG, and typhoid vaccine. The use of the inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine is allowed.\n* Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the subject's participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.\n* Use of potent inhibitors or inducers or substrates of CYP3A4 or substrates of CYP2C9 or CYP2D6 within 2 weeks before the first dose of study treatment (3 weeks for St John's Wort)\n* Use of hydroxychloroquine in <14 days prior to Day 1 of trastuzumab deruxtecan treatment\n* History of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis\n* Female patients who are pregnant, breastfeeding or of reproductive potential who are not willing to employ effective birth control from screening to 6 months after the last dose of durvalumab and at least 7 months after the final administration of trastuzumab deruxtecan due to the potential for teratogenic effects.
