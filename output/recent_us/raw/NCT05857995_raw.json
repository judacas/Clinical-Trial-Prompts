The INR for subjects on warfarin should be in the therapeutic range. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is allowed.\n* Provided written informed consent and HIPAA authorization for release of personal health information, approved by an Institutional Review Board (IRB). NOTE: HIPAA authorization may be included in the informed consent or obtained separately.\n* Women of childbearing potential (WOCP) must not be pregnant or breast-feeding. A negative serum or urine pregnancy test is required within 72 hours of study registration. If the urine test cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required.\n* Women of childbearing potential (WOCP) must be willing to use two effective methods of birth control such as an oral, implantable, injectable, or transdermal hormonal contraceptive, an intrauterine device (IUD), use of a double barrier method (condoms, sponge, diaphragm, or vaginal ring with spermicidal jellies or cream), or total abstinence for the course of the study until 120 days after the last dose of study drug. NOTE: Women are considered to be of childbearing potential unless they are postmenopausal (≥45 years of age and has not had menses for greater than 12 consecutive months), surgically sterile (bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or hysterectomy) or not heterosexually active for the duration of the study and at least 120 days after the last dose of study drug.\n* Men who are not surgically sterile (vasectomy) must agree to use an acceptable method of contraception. Male subjects with female sexual partners who are pregnant, possibly pregnant, or who could become pregnant during the study must agree to use condoms from the first dose of study drug through at least 120 days after the last dose of study drug. Total abstinence for the same study period is an acceptable alternative.\n* Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits (including geographical distance), treatment plans, laboratory tests, and other study procedures.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Surgery within 4 weeks prior to study registration except for minor procedures. NOTE: Hepatic biliary stent placement, PleurX catheter, port replacement, ureteral stent or other minor surgeries are allowed. NOTE: Subject must have adequately recovered from the toxicity and/or complications of major surgery prior to study registration, as determined by the treating physician.\n* Patients with known untreated or active central nervous system (CNS) metastases. Subjects suspected to have brain mets should undergo brain MRI (or CT head if MRI is not feasible) to exclude brain metastases. Patients with treated brain metastases will be eligible as long as their symptoms are improving or achieved new baseline and not requiring steroids for at least 2 weeks. Patients with leptomeningeal disease will be excluded regardless of clinical stability.\n* Previously received a solid organ transplant or allogeneic progenitor/stem cell transplant.\n* Received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment. Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to: measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, yellow fever, rabies, BCG, and typhoid (oral) vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g. Flu-Mist®) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.\n* History of blood clots, pulmonary embolism, or deep vein thrombosis unless on adequate anticoagulant therapy as determined by the treating investigator (subject must be on stable dose for 2 weeks) and all symptoms have resolved.\n* Known history of human immunodeficiency virus [(HIV) HIV 1/2 antibodies].\n* Known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA [qualitative] is detected).\n* Current use of immunosuppressive medication at time of study entry. The following are exceptions to this exclusion criterion: intranasal, inhaled, topical steroids, or local steroid injections (eg, intra-articular injection); steroids as premedication for hypersensitivity reactions (eg, CT scan premedication). Cases requiring systemic corticosteroids at physiologic doses must be discussed with Big Ten CRC and HiberCell prior to enrollment.\n* Active autoimmune disease that might deteriorate when receiving an immunostimulatory agent. Exceptions include: patients with controlled diabetes type 1, controlled hypo- or hyperthyroidism, resolved childhood asthma/atopy, vitiligo, or psoriasis not requiring immunosuppressive treatment.\n* Received prior chemotherapy, an immune checkpoint inhibitor, or radiation therapy within 2 weeks prior to study registration or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events from previously administered agents. NOTE: Subjects with alopecia, grade ≤ 2 sensory neuropathy or other grade ≤ 2 AEs not constituting a safety risk based on investigator judgement are an exception to this criterion and can still be considered for the study.\n* Any clinically significant infection requiring anti-infective treatment. Patients with infection that is adequately treated will be eligible.\n* History of interstitial lung disease requiring immunosuppressive/steroids or history of immunotherapy related pneumonitis that has required steroids or immunosuppression in the past.\n* Known history of active tuberculosis.\n* Any other severe, uncontrolled medical condition, including uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (defined as a Hemoglobin A1C ≥ 9% in subjects with a prior history of diabetes, 28 days prior to study registration) or unstable congestive heart failure (Stage III-IV of the New York Heart Association Functional Classification).\n* Previous known allergy or intolerance to pembrolizumab or any of its excipients.\n* Previous exposure or known allergy to Imprime PGG or any of its excipients.\n* Known hypersensitivity to Chinese hamster ovary cell products or other recombinant human antibodies.\n* Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product administration, interfere with protocol compliance, or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for enrollment in this study.\n* Presence of any non-healing wound, fracture, or ulcer within 28 days prior to study registration.\n* Any mental or medical condition that prevents the subject from giving informed consent or participating in the trial.\n* No prior malignancy is allowed except for adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, in situ breast cancer, Gleason ≤ grade 7 prostate cancers, low grade papillary urothelial carcinoma or other cancer for which the subject has been disease-free for at least 2 years.
