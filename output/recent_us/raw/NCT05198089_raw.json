    "inclusion_criteria": "* Male and female participants 18 years to 75 years of age (inclusive), with a body mass index (BMI) of 18 kg/m^2 to 40 kg/m^2 (inclusive) and body weight between 50 kg and 120 kg (inclusive) at Screening.\n* Female participants who are of non-childbearing potential must be:\n* Surgically sterile (ie, bilateral tubal ligation or removal of both ovaries and/or uterus at least 6 months prior to dosing, or Essure® with hysterosalpingogram [documentation to confirm tubal occlusion 12 weeks [wk] after procedure]).\n* Naturally postmenopausal (spontaneous cessation of menses) for at least 24 consecutive months prior to dosing, confirmed by follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) or estradiol testing.\n* Female participants of childbearing potential with proper means of hormonal and nonhormonal or barrier contraceptive methods; all female participants must have negative pregnancy tests at Screening and Check-in. Female participants must be using proper contraceptive means for at least 1 month prior to Screening. Acceptable means of contraceptive methods include sexual abstinence, vasectomy of male partner, intrauterine device, barrier methods like female condom, diaphragm or cervical cap, spermicide, hormonal contraceptives, or any combination of above. Female participants who normally abstain from sexual activity may be recruited provided that they agree to use a condom and spermicide should they become sexually active at any time during the study and for 90 days post dose. Male partners should also be informed to use a condom during this study period. Participants with hepatic impairment should consult with their primary care physician about using any oral contraceptive options (eg, would a combination of hormonal contraception and barrier contraceptive methods be allowed by the physician).\n* Male participants must agree to use a condom and spermicide during sexual intercourse until 90 days post dose or must have had a vasectomy and must be willing not to donate sperm until 90 days post dose. Female partners of male participants should be informed of additional barrier contraceptive during this time and may use barrier and/or hormonal contraceptive methods under the conditions described below. Participants with hepatic impairment should consult with their primary care physician about hormonal contraceptive options for their partner. Participants should use both hormonal and barrier methods of contraception for themselves and their partner.\n* Participants must agree to refrain from donation of blood from 56 days prior to Screening, plasma from 2 wk prior to Screening, and platelets from 6 wk prior to Screening. Participants must also agree to refrain from donation of blood until 56 days after the end of study.\n* All participants must be willing to refrain from consuming grapefruit/grapefruit juice, Seville oranges, and pomegranates/pomegranate juice 10 days before the study drug is given on Day 1 until End-of-Study.\n* Participants with hepatic impairment are required to have:\n\n  1. Documented history of chronic liver disease diagnosed by ultrasonography, computed tomography scan, liver biopsy, or magnetic resonance imaging or history of chronic (>6 months) hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.\n  2. Hepatic impairment as assessed by NCI-ODWG classification 2\n\n     Mild hepatic impairment as assessed by:\n     * Total bilirubin (Tbil) ≤upper limit of normal (ULN) and AST >ULN, or\n     * Tbil >1 to 1.5 × ULN (not due to Gilbert's syndrome)\n\n     OR\n\n     Moderate hepatic impairment as assessed by:\n     * Tbil >1.5 to 3 × ULN (not due to Gilbert's syndrome)\n  3. Physical examination findings that are normal or not clinically significant and clinical laboratory evaluations with normal limits or not clinically significant deviations, with exception of findings that in the opinion of the investigator are consistent with the participant's hepatic impairment\n  4. Clinical stability in the opinion of the investigator. No evidence of active HBV and/or new or acute HCV infection within the preceding 6 months.\n* Estimated creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥60 mL/min by Cockcroft-Gault equation at Screening and Check-in\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 75 Years",
