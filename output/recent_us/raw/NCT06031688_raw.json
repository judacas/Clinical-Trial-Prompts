    "official_title": "A Randomized Phase II Trial of Cabozantinib and Cabozantinib Plus Nivolumab Versus Standard Chemotherapy in Patients With Previously Treated Non-Squamous NSCLC",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* RANDOMIZATION (STEP 1): Patient must be >= 18 years of age\n* RANDOMIZATION (STEP 1): Patient must have pathologically confirmed non-squamous non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Patients with NSCLC not otherwise specified (NOS) are eligible. Mixed tumors will be categorized by predominant cell type. If small cell elements are present, the patient is ineligible\n* RANDOMIZATION (STEP 1): Patient must have metastatic stage IVA or IVB disease (includes M1a, M1b, and M1c), according to the 8th edition of the lung cancer TNM classification system. Recurrent metastatic NSCLC ineligible for curative therapy (in the treating investigator's opinion) is also allowed\n* RANDOMIZATION (STEP 1): Patient's tumor must be known negative for EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) sensitizing mutations (for example at a minimum, negative for EGFR Exon 19 deletions, EGFR exon 20 insertions, and Exon 21 L858R, L861Q mutations ) AND negative for ALK gene rearrangements (by fluorescence in situ hybridization [FISH], next generation sequencing [NGS], or immunohistochemistry [IHC]) by routine Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)- or Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-certified clinical testing methods. CLIA or FDA approved circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) testing is acceptable as an alternative to tissue testing\n* RANDOMIZATION (STEP 1): Patient must have radiographic and/or clinical progression (per local investigator assessment) following one, but only one, line of platinum-based chemotherapy AND one, but only one, line of prior checkpoint inhibitor (anti-PD-1 or PD-L1) immunotherapy, either concurrently or sequentially in either order. A minimum of two doses of prior immunotherapy is required. Only one prior line of therapy is allowed if patients received chemotherapy and immunotherapy together (patients may not receive subsequent single agent chemotherapy), and greater than two prior lines of therapy are not allowed.\n\n  * NOTE: Lines of therapy are defined by clinical or radiographic progression. For patients with recurrent metastatic NSCLC following treatment for stage 1-3 NSCLC, platinum-based chemotherapy received within 12 months of recurrence and/or immunotherapy received within 6 months of recurrence will meet the requirement for prior chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy but subsequent receipt of more immunotherapy and/or platinum-based chemotherapy is also allowed.\n  * NOTE: Prior anti-VEGF antibody therapy (ie bevacizumab) is allowed. Prior ipilimumab, or investigational agents not excluded below, in combination with the required prior therapies above are allowed.\n  * NOTE: Prior receipt of one or two lines of targeted therapy for ROS1, RET, MET, BRAF, ERBB2/HER2, or KRAS G12C positive NSCLC is allowed and will not count toward the line of therapy limit. However, progression is still required after chemotherapy and immunotherapy as above. Patients with ROS1, RET, MET positive NSCLC are strongly encouraged to get appropriate targeted therapy (such as crizotinib, entrectinib, lorlatinib, selpercatinib, pralsetinib, capmatinib, tepotinib, or another investigational, off-label, or approved agent directed against ROS1, RET, or MET positive NSCLC) prior to participation and will be stratified.\n  * NOTE: No prior predominantly VEGFR directed TKI therapy (such as cabozantinib, lenvatinib, or sitravantinib) is allowed, except for the agents named above.\n* RANDOMIZATION (STEP 1): The investigator must document the intended chemotherapy regimen should their patient be randomized to Arm C (docetaxel and ramucirumab, OR single agent chemotherapy - docetaxel, gemcitabine, paclitaxel, nab-paclitaxel).
