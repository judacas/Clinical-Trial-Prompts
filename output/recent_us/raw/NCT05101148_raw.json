    "official_title": "A Pilot Study of Stereotactic Radiosurgical Hypophysectomy for Intractable Pain From Bone Metastases",
    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Cytologic proof of malignancy\n2. Radiographic evidence of bone metastases\n3. Intractable pain uncontrolled by opioids, medical management, injections/ablation or surgical intervention that would be difficult to address with conventional radiation therapy or other standard options and is limiting the patient's function and quality of life. Intractable pain will be defined as a visual analogue score of at least 4.\n4. Definitive radiographic progression of osseous and/or visceral metastases on standard staging scans (CT, MRI, bone scan, PET scan or any other standard of care imaging) performed within the last 3 months in spite of standard oncologic interventions and/or inability to tolerate standard oncologic interventions\n5. Life expectancy at least 4 weeks\n6. Ageâ‰¥ 18 years\n7. Patients of childbearing potential (male or female) must practice adequate contraception due to possible harmful effects of radiation therapy on an unborn child\n8. Patient must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document\n9.

    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Prior brain radiation\n2. Patients must not have a serious medical or psychiatric illness that would, in the opinion of the treating physician prevent informed consent or completion of protocol treatment\n3. Isolated localized pain amenable to focal radiation therapy, or pain well controlled by opioids, medical management, injections/ablation or surgical intervention\n4. Malignancies being managed with curative intent\n5. Life expectancy <4 weeks\n6. The tumor amenable to curative management",
