    "official_title": "A Pilot Study to Estimate the Safety and Tolerability of the Combination of Polatuzumab Vedotin, With or Without Glofitamab, With Dose Adjusted Rituximab, Etoposide, Cyclophosphamide, and Doxorubicin (PERCH) for Upfront Treatment of Aggressive B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Untreated aggressive B-cell large-B cell lymphoma (non-Hodgkin lymphoma) with adverse features that may predict sub-optimal response to rituximab-cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin (hydroxydaunorubicin), vincristine (Oncovin), prednisone (R-CHOP) and in the opinion of the investigator would be treated with DA-EPOCH-R as standard of care. Subjects must be planned to receive full course (6 cycles) chemoimmunotherapy as per clinical standard of care. Composite lymphomas are not excluded provided that the subject has not receive prior systemic therapy for the indolent component and would receive DA-EPOCH-R as the standard of care regimen for the aggressive component.

A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is post-menarcheal, has not reached a postmenopausal state (=<12 continuous months of amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone surgical sterilization (removal of ovaries and/or uterus). The definition of childbearing potential may be adapted for alignment with local guidelines or requirements. Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of =<1% per year include bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, hormonal contraceptives that inhibit ovulation, hormone-releasing intrauterine devices, and copper intrauterine devices.

Men must refrain from donating sperm during this same period. The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.
