Subjects who are hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) positive and who are surface antigen negative will need to have a negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Those who are hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive or hepatitis B PCR positive will be excluded. Subjects who are hepatitis C antibody positive will need to have a negative PCR result. Those who are hepatitis C PCR positive will be excluded\n* Patients with uncontrolled autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) or autoimmune thrombocytopenia (ITP)\n* Patients with severe hematopoietic insufficiency as defined by an absolute neutrophil count of less than 500/μL, unless disease-related, and/or a platelet count of less than 30,000/μL at time of screening for this protocol.\n* Clinically significant cardiovascular disease such as uncontrolled or symptomatic arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, or myocardial infarction within 6 months of heart failure, or any class 3 or 4 cardiac disease as defined by the New York Heart Association Functional Classification. Subjects with controlled, asymptomatic atrial fibrillation can enroll. Patients with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) or deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism (DVT/PE) can be included if they had no signs of PAF or DVT/PE in the last 6 months before enrolment.
