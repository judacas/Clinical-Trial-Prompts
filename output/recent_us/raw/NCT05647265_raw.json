    "official_title": "A Phase 3 Randomized Controlled Trial of Post-Surgical Stereotactic Radiotherapy (SRT) Versus Surgically Targeted Radiation Therapy (STaRT) With Gamma Tile for Treatment of Newly Diagnosed Metastatic Brain Tumors.",
    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Patients aged 18 years old and above. Eligibility is restricted to this age group given that the battery of neurocognitive tests utilized in this protocol are not developed or validated for use in a younger population.\n2. One to six newly diagnosed brain metastases, identified on the screening MRI, from an extracranial primary tumor.\n3. Only one lesion, designated the index lesion, is planned for surgical resection. The index lesion must be between 2.0 and 7.0 cm in maximal extent on the screening MRI, and gross total resection is expected by the neurosurgeon.\n4. Non-index lesions must measure ≤ 4.0 cm in maximal extent on the screening MRI brain scan. The unresected lesions will be treated with SRT as outlined in the treatment section of the concept.\n5. All metastases must be located ≥ 5 mm from the optic chiasm and outside the brainstem. Dural based metastasis are eligible.\n6. Previous and/or concurrent treatment with investigational or FDA approved systemic therapies (e.g., chemotherapy, targeted therapeutics, immunotherapy) are permitted and must follow protocol guidelines as follows: Systemic therapy is allowed a minimum of one week from last systemic therapy cycle to surgical resection, and one week after surgical resection to allow a minimum of one week before starting/resuming systemic therapy, depending on the specific systemic agent(s), as recommended by medical/neuro-oncology. Systemic therapy is not allowed 1 day before SRT, the same day as the SRT, or 1 day after the completion of the SRT or longer, depending on the specific systemic agent(s), as recommended by medical/neuro-oncology. Agents that are delivered by implant or depot injections (such as hormonal therapies) are excluded from these restrictions.\n7. Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) score of ≥ 70. Patients with KPS < 70 can be enrolled if their baseline KPS within 14 days of screening was estimated ≥ 70 and surgical management is expected to improve KPS to ≥ 70.\n8. Stable systemic disease or reasonable systemic treatment options predicting a life expectancy of ≥6 months.\n9. Ability to complete an MRI of the head with contrast\n10. Adequate renal and hepatic function to undergo surgery, in investigators opinion.\n11. For women of childbearing potential only, a negative urine or serum pregnancy test done <7 days prior to randomization is required. Women must be willing to notify investigator immediately if they become pregnant at any time during the trial period.\n12. Men and women of childbearing potential must be willing to employ adequate contraception throughout the study and for men for up to 3 months after completing treatment.\n13. Subjects must be fluent in English, Spanish, or another language the study site is prepared to obtain informed consent for in this trial. English speaking subjects will complete Neurocognitive assessments. Non-English-speaking subjects are trial-eligible but will not complete the Neurocognitive assessments as the psychometric properties for translated tests are either not known or not as robust.\n14. Willingness and ability to provide written informed consent and HIPAA authorization prior to performance of any study-related procedures. A legally authorized representative may provide consent if the potential subject lacks the capacity to provide consent themselves.\n\nExclusion Criteria\n\n1. Age <18 years.\n2. Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) score of <70. Patients with KPS < 70 can be enrolled if their baseline KPS within 14 days of screening was estimated ≥ 70 and surgical management is expected to improve KPS to ≥ 70.\n3. Sensitivity to bovine (cow) derived materials including collagen products.\n4. Past radiation or surgical therapy to the index lesion or the newly diagnosed non-index lesion(s) is exclusionary. However, up to a total of 2 prior courses of SRT treatment to previously diagnosed lesions are allowed as long as any treated lesions are were ≥15mm from the index lesion.\n5. Patients with >6 newly diagnosed metastases on screening MRI\n6. Pregnant patients.\n7. Primary germ cell tumor, small cell carcinoma, or lymphoma.\n8. Leptomeningeal metastasis (LMD). Note: For the purposes of exclusion, LMD is a clinical diagnosis, defined as radiologic or clinical evidence of leptomeningeal involvement with or without positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology.\n9. Prior WBRT for brain metastases.\n10. Concomitant therapy that, in the investigator's opinion, would interfere with the evaluation of the safety or efficacy of the study device.\n11. Comorbid psychiatric or neurologic disease or injury impacting cognition, in the opinion of the treating physician, that might impair patient's ability to understand or comply with the requirements of the study or to provide consent\n12. Subjects who, in the investigator's opinion, are unable to understand the protocol or to give informed consent, have a history of poor cooperation, noncompliance with medical treatment, or difficulty in returning for follow up care. A legally authorized representative may provide consent if the potential subject lacks the capacity to provide consent themselves.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
