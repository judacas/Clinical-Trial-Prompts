    "inclusion_criteria": "* For patients enrolled on APEC14B1 prior to enrollment on AALL1631, the required diagnostic bone marrow sample has been fulfilled\n\n  * For patients who have not previously enrolled on APEC14B1 prior to enrollment on AALL1631, a baseline diagnostic sample (or peripheral blood sample with blasts if marrow sample unavailable) must be available to develop an MRD probe\n  * In addition, laboratory reports detailing evidence of BCR::ABL1 fusion or ABL-class fusion must be submitted for rapid central review within 72 hours of study enrollment\n* >= 1 year (365 days) and =< 21 years at ALL diagnosis\n* Ph+ (BCR::ABL1 fusion): newly diagnosed de novo ALL (B-ALL or T-ALL) or mixed phenotypic acute leukemia (MPAL meeting 2016 World Health Organization [WHO] definition) with definitive evidence of BCR::ABL1 fusion by karyotype, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and/or molecular methodologies\n* ABL-class fusion: newly diagnosed B-ALL with definitive evidence of ABL-class fusions. ABL-class fusions are defined as those involving the following genes: ABL1, ABL2, CSF1R, PDGFRB, PDGFRA. Methods of detection include fluorescence in-situ hybridization ([FISH], e.g. using break-apart or colocalization signals probes), multiplex or singleplex reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), whole transcriptome or panel-based RNA-sequencing (e.g. TruSight RNA Pan-Cancer Panel; Illumina, San Diego, California [CA], United States of America [USA] or similar)\n* Ph+ patients must have previously started Induction therapy, which includes vincristine, a corticosteroid, pegaspargase, with or without anthracycline, and/or other standard cytotoxic chemotherapy\n* Ph+ patients have not received more than 14 days of multiagent Induction therapy beginning with the first dose of vinCRIStine\n* Ph+ patients may have started imatinib prior to study entry but have not received more than 14 days of imatinib\n* ABL-class fusion patients must have previously completed the 4 or 5 weeks of multiagent Induction chemotherapy (Induction IA phase)\n* ABL-class fusion patients may have started imatinib during Induction IA, at the same time of or after the first vinCRIStine dose\n* Patients must have a performance status corresponding to Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scores of 0, 1, or 2\n* Direct bilirubin =< 2.0 mg/dL\n* Shortening fraction of >= 27% by echocardiogram\n* Ejection fraction of >= 50% by radionuclide angiogram or echocardiogram\n* Corrected QT interval, QTc < 480 msec\n\n  * Note: Repeat echocardiogram and electrocardiogram are not required if they were performed at or after initial ALL diagnosis, before study enrollment\n* Creatinine clearance or radioisotope glomerular filtration rate (GFR) >= 70 mL/min/1.73 m^2 or serum creatinine within normal limits based on age/gender, as follows:\n\n  * 1 to < 2 years: maximum serum creatinine 0.6 mg/dL (both male and female)\n  * 2 to < 6 years: maximum serum creatinine 0.8 mg/dL (both male and female)\n  * 6 to < 10 years: maximum serum creatinine 1 mg/dL (both male and female)\n  * 10 to < 13 years: maximum serum creatinine 1.2 mg/dL (both male and female)\n  * 13 to < 16 years: maximum serum creatinine 1.5 mg/dL (male), 1.4 mg/dL (female)\n  * >= 16 years: maximum serum creatinine 1.7 mg/dL (male), 1.4 mg/dL (female)\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 1 Year\nMust have maximum age of 21 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Known history of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)\n* ALL developing after a previous cancer treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy\n* Active, uncontrolled infection, or active systemic illness that requires ongoing vasopressor support or mechanical ventilation\n* Down syndrome\n* Pregnancy and breast feeding\n\n  * Female patients who are pregnant since fetal toxicities and teratogenic effects have been noted for several of the study drugs. A pregnancy test is required for female patients of childbearing potential\n  * Lactating females who plan to breastfeed their infants\n  * Sexually active patients of reproductive potential who have not agreed to use an effective contraceptive method for the duration of treatment according to protocol\n* Patients with congenital long QT syndrome, history of ventricular arrhythmias or heart block\n* Prior treatment with dasatinib, or any TKI other than imatinib",
