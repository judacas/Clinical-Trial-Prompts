Subjects must be resistant (at least stable disease at 12 weeks of treatment with anti-PD1, anti-PD-L1 therapy) (cohort A) or refractory (progression within 12 weeks of starting anti-PD1 therapy) (cohort B) to an Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved anti PD 1/PD L1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) as either monotherapy or in combination with other approved checkpoint inhibitors or other therapies according to their label, defined as (subjects must meet all of the following criteria):\n\n  * Have received at least 2 doses of anti PD 1/PD L1 mAb\n  * Progressive disease after anti PD 1/PD L1 mAb defined according to RECIST 1.1\n  * Have documented progressive disease (PD) within 12 weeks of the last dose of anti PD 1/PD L1 mAb. Patients who were re-treated with anti PD 1/PD L1 mAb and patients who were on maintenance with anti PD 1/PD L1 mAb will be allowed to enter the trial as long as there is documented PD within 12 weeks of the last treatment date (with anti PD 1/PD L1 mAb)\n\n    * Note - Subjects who have withdrawn from standard treatment due to unacceptable toxicity warranting discontinuation of that treatment and precluding retreatment with the same agent before progression of disease will also be eligible\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
