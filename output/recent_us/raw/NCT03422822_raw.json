Genetic screening with presence of amyloid-related pathology; or\n   3. Amyloid-specific imaging study (e.g., bone scintigraphy and echocardiogram/CMR consistent with ATTR cardiac amyloid).\n5. Subjects with AL systemic amyloidosis must have achieved a hematologic very good partial response (VGPR) or complete response (CR) based on their most recent assessment (e.g., difference in free light chains <40 mg/L) and within 12 months of Screening and may be receiving maintenance daratumumab.\n6. Subjects with ATTR systemic amyloidosis may be receiving a TTR silencer (e.g., inotersen, vutrisiran, or patisiran) or a stabilizer (e.g., tafamadis or diflunisal), but not both.\n7. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP):\n\n   1. WOCBP must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 24 hours prior to the start of study treatment.\n   2.
