ECOG PS 2 or higher; impaired hearing\n* BLADDER: ANC >= 1500/mm^3 without colony stimulating factor support (clinical laboratory values at screening)\n* BLADDER: Platelets >= 100,000/mm^3 (clinical laboratory values at screening)\n* BLADDER: Hemoglobin >= 9 g/dL (clinical laboratory values at screening)\n* BLADDER: Bilirubin =< 1.5 x the ULN; for subjects with known Gilbert's disease, bilirubin =< 3.0 mg/dL (clinical laboratory values at screening)\n* BLADDER: Serum albumin >= 2.8g/dl (clinical laboratory values at screening)\n* BLADDER: Serum creatinine clearance (CrCl) >= 20 mL/min (clinical laboratory values at screening); dialysis patients will be excluded; for creatinine clearance estimation, the Cockcroft and Gault equation should be used\n* BLADDER: Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) =< 3.0 x ULN (clinical laboratory values at screening)\n* BLADDER: Each subject must sign an informed consent form (ICF) indicating that he understands the purpose of and procedures required for the study and is willing to participate in the study\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
