    "inclusion_criteria": "* Subjects with a diagnosis of FDG-avid relapsed or refractory classical HL OR select subtypes of FDG-avid CD30-positive relapsed or refractory PTCL\n* For subjects with R/R PTCL a pre-enrollment tumor biopsy positive for CD30 locally assessed by Ber-H2 targeted immunohistochemistry at â‰¥1% is mandatory (PTCL subtypes: PTCL-NOS, Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma, ALCL, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive, ALCL, ALK-negative)\n* Subjects with R/R classical HL must have received at least two lines of therapy including one prior line of combination chemotherapy. Prior therapy must also have included brentuximab vedotin and a PD1 check point inhibitor.\n* Subjects with R/R PTCL must have received at least one prior line of combination chemotherapy. Subjects with ALCL subtype of PTCL must have received or been intolerant to brentuximab vedotin.\n* Subjects with R/R classical HL AND R/R PTCL: Prior ASCT is permitted if completed at least 3 months prior to the first dose of study treatment. Prior allogeneic stem cell transplantation will be permitted if completed at least 1 year from study enrollment and there are no signs or symptoms of GVHD. Prior CAR-T therapy is permitted if last CAR-T dose completed at least 6 months prior to the first dose of study treatment.\n* Ability to understand and sign the ICF\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
