High-risk broad-spectrum antibiotics include carbapenems (meropenem, imipenem, doripenem), anti-pseudomonal antibiotics (cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftazidime) or anaerobic antibiotics including metronidazole, clindamycin, amoxicillin-sulbactam.\n5.

Adequate hepatic function defined by a total bilirubin level ≤ 1.5 ≤ x the upper limit of normal (ULN)[except if Gilberts syndrome and then total bilirubin ≤ 3x is allowed], an AST, level ≤ 2.5 x ULN, and an ALT level ≤ 2.5 x ULN. If liver metastases are present, then AST and ALT levels must be ≤ 4 x ULN\n9. Adequate renal function defined by an estimated creatinine clearance >30 mL/min according to the Cockcroft-Gault formula or by a creatinine clearance measurement from a 24-hour urine collection.\n10.
