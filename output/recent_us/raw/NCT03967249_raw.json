    "official_title": "A Phase IIIb Open-Label, Single-Arm, Multi-Center, US Study of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) Administered in Combination With Durvalumab in Adult BCG-naïve, High-risk Non-Muscle- Invasive Bladder Cancer Participants (PATAPSCO)",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* BCG-naïve (defined as participants not having received prior intravesical BCG or who previously received but stopped BCG more than 3 years before study entry).\n* Local histological confirmation (based on cytology and/or pathology report) of high-risk transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelium of the urinary bladder confined to the mucosa or submucosa.\n* Complete resection of all Ta/T1 papillary disease prior to enrollment, with the transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) removing high-risk NMIBC (non-muscle invasive bladder cancer) performed not more than 4 months before enrollment in the study.\n* No prior radiotherapy for bladder cancer.\n* A life expectancy of at least 12 weeks (90 days).\n* Adequate organ and marrow function\n* World Health Organization/Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 at screening\n* No prior exposure to immune-mediated therapy of cancer\n* A candidate for BCG treatment.\n* Local histological confirmation (based on cytology and/or pathology report) of high-risk transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelium of the urinary bladder confined to the mucosa or submucosa. A high-risk tumor is defined as one of the following: T1 tumor; High-grade/G3 tumor; CIS.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 130 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Evidence of muscle-invasive, locally advanced, metastatic, and/or extra-vesical bladder cancer (ie, T2, T3, T4, and / or Stage IV).\n* Predominantly variant histology such as micropapillary, plasmacytoid, nested, sarcomatoid, microcystic, squamous and adeno variants of UC representing > 50% of tumor tissue or other than urothelial tumors as assessed by pathology.\n* Evidence of lymphovascular invasion of bladder tumor, except if treatment with BCG is deemed to be the only clinically viable treatment.\n* Immediate cystectomy is indicated.\n* Known or documented absolute and/or relative contraindication of adjuvant intravesical BCG treatment.\n* Concurrent extravesical, non-muscle-invasive transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelium.\n* History of allogenic organ transplantation. Participants with any history of allogenic stem cell transplantation are also excluded.\n* Active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders.\n* Participants with hypothyroidism stable on hormone replacement.\n* History of active primary immunodeficiency.\n* Active infection including hepatitis B (known positive HBV/HBsAg result), HCV, or HIV 1/2 (positive HIV) antibodies.\n* Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 14 days before the first durvalumab dose.\n* Female participants who are pregnant or breastfeeding or male or female participants of reproductive potential who are not willing to employ highly effective birth control.\n* Any concurrent chemotherapy, study intervention, biologic or hormonal therapy for cancer treatment; uncontrolled intercurrent illness;\n* History of another primary malignancy except for Malignancy treated with curative intent and with no known active disease ≥ 2 years; Adequately treated nonmelanoma skin cancer or lentigo maligna without evidence of disease; Adequately treated CIS without evidence of disease; Prostate cancer of stage ≤ T2cN0M0 without biochemical recurrence or progression that in the opinion of the Investigator does not require active intervention.\n* Previous or concurrent treatment with potent systemic immunostimulatory agents",
