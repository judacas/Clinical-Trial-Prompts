    "official_title": "Safety and Efficacy of SRS and Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICI) Concurrent With NovoTTF-100M in Melanoma Brain Metastases",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Be willing and able to provide written informed consent for the trial\n* Have diagnosis of malignant melanoma.\n* Be >= 22 years of age on the day of signing informed consent\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0-1 or Karnofsky performance status >= 70%\n* Patients must have histological diagnosis of melanoma\n* Preference is for treatment naive patients that have not gotten previous immunotherapy. However, if approved by principal investigator (PI), patients that have gotten prior PD1 and/or dual immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy may be allowed on this trial if they have progressed intra-cranially or extra-cranially, and have very limited disease progression.\n* Patient must be asymptomatic at time of getting SRS (day 0) on trial. Prednisone =< 20 mg/day (4 mg or less of dexamethasone equivalent) for at least 7 days prior to treatment is allowed\n* Patients with ocular, mucosal and unknown primary melanoma will also be eligible\n* Patients with 1-10 untreated brain metastases at time of initial brain metastases diagnosis (surgery to at least one of the brain lesions and/or biopsy of a lesion for diagnostic purposes and/or for standard of care purposes is acceptable). If patient has surgical removal of at least one lesion, the investigator would wait for a reasonable time after surgery to start the TTFields, SRS and Immunotherapy. This is typically around 2-4 weeks after resection and clearance by neurosurgery to start the treatment. However, the exact time to start would depend on institutional standard of care practice pattern. Enrollment of patient can take place before or after planned surgery.\n* Eligible for hypofractionation approach (9 Gy x 3 or 6 Gy x 5). 9 Gyx 3 is preferred approach, but 6 Gy x 5 fractions is acceptable\n* Eligible for immunotherapy and TTFields. The TTField wires will be removed immediately before the SRS delivery and then reconnected again immediately after SRS each session. The arrays will be left on the skin during SRS. This is to minimize any electrical discharge from the wires that may occur as a result of SRS beams going through the arrays and/or lead to any dose heterogeneity during SRS delivery and/or damage the electrical, battery operated equipment\n* Be willing to comply with NovoTTF-100M device treatment for at least 75% of the time\n* Must have caregiver or self support available to assist transducer array exchange.\n* Prior radiation to the primary and/or regional radiotherapy for melanoma is acceptable.\n* Baseline labs as within standard of care (complete blood count [CBC], comprehensive metabolic panel [CMP], lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], etc) are required within 28 days of enrollment.\n* Have at least one measurable extra-cranial site of disease\n* Patients must have at least 14 days to recover from all prior treatment, including surgery, chemotherapy, immunotherapies, prior to enrollment on this protocol.\n* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >= 1,500 /mcL (performed within 28 days of treatment initiation)\n* Platelets >= 100,000 / mcL (performed within 28 days of treatment initiation)\n* Hemoglobin >= 9 g/dL or >= 5.6 mmol/L without transfusion or erythropoietin (EPO) dependency (within 7 days of assessment) (performed within 28 days of treatment initiation)\n* Serum creatinine =< 1.5 X upper limit of normal (ULN) OR measured or calculated creatinine clearance (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] can also be used in place of creatinine or creatinine clearance [CrCl]) >= 60 mL/min for subject with creatinine levels > 1.5 X institutional ULN (performed within 28 days of treatment initiation)\n* Serum total bilirubin =< 1.5 X ULN OR direct bilirubin =< ULN for subjects with total bilirubin levels > 1.5 ULN\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT]) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT]) =< 2.5 X ULN OR =< 5 X ULN for subjects with liver metastases (performed within 28 days of treatment initiation)\n* Albumin >= 2.5 mg/dL (performed within 28 days of treatment initiation)\n* International normalized ratio (INR) or prothrombin time (PT) =< 1.5 X ULN unless subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or partial thromboplastin time (PTT) is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants (performed within 28 days of treatment initiation)\n* Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) =< 1.5 X ULN unless subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants (performed within 28 days of treatment initiation)\n* Female subject of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy within 2 weeks prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required.\n\n  * Female subjects of childbearing potential should be willing to use 2 methods of birth control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course of the study through 120 days after the last dose of study medication. Subjects of childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not been free from menses for > 2 year. This is referring primarily to the use of immunotherapy.\n  * Male subjects should agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting with the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy. This is referring primarily to the use of immunotherapy.\n  * Abstinence is acceptable, if this is the usual life style and preferred contraception for the patient\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 22 Years",
