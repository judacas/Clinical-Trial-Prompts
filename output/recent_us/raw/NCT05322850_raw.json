    "official_title": "G-FORCE-1: An Open-Label Phase 1 Two Part Dose Escalation Trial of RRx-001 Concurrent With Radiation and Temozolomide and RRx-001 + Temozolomide Post-RT In Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma and Anaplastic Gliomas With Intact 1p/19q Chromosomes",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Histologically proven diagnosis of high-grade glioma, including anaplastic glioma (WHO grade III with 1p/19q chromosomes intact), glioblastoma (WHO grade IV) or gliosarcoma (WHO Grade IV);\n* The tumor must not have an infratentorial component;\n* The patient must have recovered from the effects of surgery, postoperative infection and other complications before enrollment;\n* Estimated survival of at least 12 weeks;\n* Karnofsky Performance Score of ≥ 70% at the time of entry\n* Stable or decreasing steroid dose within 2 weeks of first dose of study drug if patient is taking steroids. No steroid use is also acceptable.\n* Neurological stability for at least 14 days prior to first dose of study drug;\n* Acceptable liver function at Screening,\n* Serum creatinine < 1.5x institution upper limit of normal\n* Acceptable hematologic status at Screening\n* Female subjects of childbearing potential, and male subjects with partners of childbearing potential, must agree to use medically acceptable methods of contraception.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Prior invasive malignancy (except for non-melanomatous skin cancer) unless disease free for ≥ 3 years.\n* Recurrent malignant gliomas previously treated with radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy\n* Metastases detected below the tentorium or beyond the cranial vault, including tumors with evidence of leptomeningeal metastases as previously indicated;\n* Prior chemotherapy or radiosensitizers for cancers of the head and neck region; note that prior chemotherapy for a different cancer is allowable, except prior temozolomide. Prior use of Gliadel wafers or any other intratumoral or intracavitary treatment are not permitted;\n* Prior radiotherapy to the head or neck (except for T1 glottic cancer), that would result in overlap of radiation fields.\n* Active connective tissue disorders, such as lupus or scleroderma that in the opinion of the treating physician may put the patient at high risk for radiation toxicity;\n* Unresolved toxicity higher than CTCAE (v. 4.03) Grade 1 attributed to any prior therapy/procedure excluding alopecia and hypothyroidism;\n* Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) due to the potential for increased complications from treatment; note, however, that HIV testing is not required\n* No other concurrent chemotherapeutic or investigational agents for this cancer. However, concurrent glucocorticoids are allowed;\n* Inability to swallow pills;\n* Serious co-morbid medical conditions, or a clinically significant laboratory finding(s) or any finding(s) on history and/or examination that, in the opinion of the Investigator, could interfere with the conduct of the study or could put the patient at unacceptable risk;\n* Patients who are pregnant or lactating or who are planning to become pregnant during the course of the study are excluded.",
