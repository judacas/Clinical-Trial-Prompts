Note: Stable chronic liver disease (including Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones) or hepatobiliary involvement of malignancy is acceptable if patient otherwise meets entry criteria\n* Malignancies other than disease under study, unless the second malignancy has been medically stable for at least 2 years and, in the opinion of the principal investigators, will not affect the evaluation of the effects of clinical trial treatments on the currently targeted malignancy. Participants with curatively treated non-melanoma skin cancer may be enrolled without a 2-year restriction\n* Evidence of cardiovascular risk including any of the following:\n\n  * Evidence of current clinically significant uncontrolled arrhythmias, including clinically significant electrocardiography (EKG) abnormalities such as 2nd degree (type II) or 3rd degree atrioventricular (AV) block.\n  * History of myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndromes (including unstable angina), coronary angioplasty, or stenting or bypass grafting within two months of first dose.\n  * Class III or IV heart failure as defined by the New York Heart Association functional classification system.\n  * Uncontrolled hypertension\n* Known immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reaction or idiosyncrasy to drugs chemically related to belantamab mafodotin or lenalidomide\n* Active infection requiring antibiotic, antiviral, or antifungal treatment\n* Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection\n* Presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), at or within 3 months of registration Note: If Hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) present, see additional monitoring recommendations\n* Positive hepatitis C antibody test result or positive hepatitis C ribonucleic acid (RNA) test result at or within 3 months prior registration.
