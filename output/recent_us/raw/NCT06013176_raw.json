    "exclusion_criteria": "* Any of the following because this study involves an investigational agent that has known genotoxic, mutagenic, and teratogenic effects:\n\n  * Pregnant persons\n  * Nursing persons\n* Persons of childbearing potential (and persons able to father a child) who are unwilling to employ adequate contraception\n\n  * Persons of childbearing potential (PCBP) unwilling to use two reliable forms of contraception simultaneously or to practice complete abstinence (true abstinence is acceptable when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal or postovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception) from heterosexual contact during the following time periods related to this study:\n  * For ≥ 28 days before starting treatment, during treatment and dose interruptions, and for ≥ 28 days after the last dose of golcadomide\n  * Examples of highly effective methods of contraception:\n\n    * Intrauterine device (IUD)\n    * Hormonal (birth control pills, injections, implants, levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system [IUS], medroxyprogesterone acetate depot injections, ovulation inhibitory\n    * Progesterone-only pills [e.g., desogestrel])\n    * Tubal ligation\n    * Partner's vasectomy\n  * Examples of additional effective methods:\n\n    * Male condom\n    * Diaphragm\n    * Cervical cap\n  * Persons who can father a child unwilling to practice complete abstinence (true abstinence is acceptable when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal or post-ovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.) or unwilling to use a condom during sexual contact with a pregnant person or a PCBP during treatment and dose interruptions, and for > 28 days following the last dose of golcadomide, even if they have undergone a successful vasectomy\n  * Persons who can father a child and are unwilling to refrain from donating semen or sperm while receiving golcadomide, during dose interruptions, or for ≥ 28 days following the last dose of golcadomide\n* Life expectancy < 3 months\n* Any of the following prior therapies:\n\n  * Any prior CAR-T or other T-cell targeting treatment (approved or investigational) ≤ 4 weeks prior to registration\n  * Any prior systemic anti-cancer treatment (approved or investigational) ≤ 5 half-lives or 4 weeks prior to registration, whichever is shorter\n\n    * Exception: Monoclonal and bispecific antibodies is acceptable\n  * Prior therapy with golcadomide ≤ 4 weeks prior to registration\n  * Prior autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT) ≤ 3 months prior to registration. If subject had autologous SCT > 3 months prior to the start of registration, any treatment-related toxicity is unresolved (grade > 1)\n  * Major surgery ≤ 3 weeks prior to registration\n  * Chemotherapy ≤ 2 weeks prior to registration\n  * Concomitant radiation therapy; local palliative radiotherapy is permitted\n* Co-morbid systemic illnesses or other severe concurrent disease or cancer which, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study or interfere significantly with the proper assessment of safety and toxicity of the prescribed regimens\n* Impaired cardiac function or clinically significant cardiac diseases including, but not limited to:\n\n  * Symptomatic congestive heart failure\n  * History of myocardial infarction ≤ 6 months, or congestive heart failure requiring use of ongoing maintenance therapy for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias\n  * Unstable angina pectoris\n  * Cardiac arrhythmia\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent non-cardiac illness including, but not limited to:\n\n  * Ongoing or active infection\n  * Psychiatric illness/social situations\n  * Dyspnea at rest due to complications of advanced malignancy or other disease that requires continuous oxygen therapy (such as interstitial lung disease or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD])\n  * Any other conditions that would limit compliance with study requirements\n* Subject had prior allogeneic SCT with either standard or reduced intensity conditioning ≤ 6 months prior to registration. If subject had prior allogeneic SCT > 6 months prior to registration, any treatment-related toxicity is unresolved (grade >1)\n* Immunocompromised patients and patients known to be HIV positive and currently receiving antiretroviral therapy, as there is currently no safety data in HIV positive patients\n* Subject has known chronic active hepatitis B or C virus (HBV/HCV) infection\n\n  * Exception: Patients with HBV and an undetectable viral load who are on suppressive therapy and/or those with HCV and an undetectable viral load are allowed\n* Concurrent administration of strong or moderate CYP3A4/5 inhibitors and inducers within 14 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer before the study treatment administration\n* Receiving any other investigational agent which would be considered as a treatment for lymphoma.\n\n  * Exception: Corticosteroids are allowed\n* Active second malignancy requiring treatment that would interfere with the assessment of the response of the primary cancer or interpretation of the safety of this protocol therapy\n* History of deep venous thrombosis/embolism, threatening thromboembolism or known thrombophilia. Patients with a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)/pulmonary embolism (PE) or thrombophilia may still participate if they are willing to be on full anticoagulation during treatment. Full anticoagulation is defined as Warfarin, factor X inhibitors, or low molecular weight heparin at therapeutic doses. The rationale for this requirement is that golcadomide therapy is associated with an increased risk of thrombosis. Patients with no history of DVT/PE or thrombophilia are not required to take anticoagulation and/or anti-platelet prophylaxis\n\n  * NOTE: If a patient develops a thrombotic event, they must be able and willing to receive anticoagulation therapy with aspirin 81-325 mg daily prophylaxis, low molecular weight heparin, factor X inhibitors or Warfarin. This is due to an increased risk of thrombosis in patients treated with golcadomide without prophylaxis\n* Live COVID-19 vaccine administered ≤ 28 days prior to registration",
