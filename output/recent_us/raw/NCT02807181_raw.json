    "inclusion_criteria": "1.

Prior progression on at least one androgen signaling inhibitor (e.g. abiraterone acetate, apalutamide, enzalutamide, darolutamide ). Treatment with prior androgen signaling inhibitor may have been initiated in either the castration-sensitive prostate cancer (CSPC) and/or CRPC setting.\n4. Patients must be evaluable for the primary endpoint of composite response and must have either serum Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) > 2 ng/mL during screening and/or measurable disease by RECIST 1.1 criteria.\n5. Participants must have clinicogenomic evidence of treatment emergent small cell neuroendocrine prostate cancer as defined by one or more of the following:\n\n   1.

Either monoallelic or biallelic mutations in RB1 are allowed.\n6. No more than one prior line of taxane-based chemotherapy administered in the metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) setting. Chemotherapy administered in the castration-sensitive setting does not count towards this limit. Prior carboplatin is allowed and does not count as an additional line of therapy when given in conjunction with taxane.\n7. Castrate level of serum testosterone at study entry (<50 ng/dL).

Total bilirubin <= 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN), unless elevated due to Gilbert's syndrome and direct bilirubin is within normal limits\n    5. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT)) <=3 X institutional upper limit of normal (<= 5 x ULN in presence of liver metastases)\n    6. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT)) <=3 X institutional upper limit of normal (<= 5 x ULN in presence of liver metastases)\n    7. Serum creatinine <= 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal\n12. Ability to understand a written informed consent document, and the willingness to sign it.\n13. Patients must agree to use adequate contraception and to not donate sperm prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 5 months after last administration of study treatment. Adequate contraception includes:\n\n    1. Patients who are sexually active should consider their female partner to be of childbearing potential if she has experienced menarche and is not postmenopausal (defined as amenorrhea > 24 consecutive months) or has not undergone successful surgical sterilization.\n    2. Even participants who have undergone vasectomy should still use acceptable method of contraception.\n    3. Acceptable methods of contraception include hormonal combined (estrogen + progesterone) or progesterone only given orally, injected or implanted; intrauterine device (IUD), non hormonal intrauterine systems (IUS), tubal ligation, vasectomy and complete sexual abstinence.\n14. Patients must be willing to undergo metastatic tumor biopsy during Screening if no biopsy has previously been done. If no metastatic lesion is safely accessible to tumor biopsy, this requirement will be waived. Bone or soft tissue lesion is allowed, but soft tissue will be prioritized. If a patient has archival tissue obtained within 90 days of cycle 1 day 1 (C1D1) the requirement for fresh tumor biopsy will be waived.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be MALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
