    "exclusion_criteria": "* Autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant\n* Patients may not have received more than 3 prior regimens, where the regimen intent was to induce remission\n* Receiving any other investigational agents or concurrent biological, intensive chemotherapy or radiation therapy for the previous 2 weeks from conditioning. Note: Receiving any other investigational agents or concurrent biological, intensive chemotherapy or radiation therapy for the previous 2 weeks from conditioning\n* Patients should have discontinued all previous intensive therapy, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy for 2 weeks prior to commencing therapy on this study. Note: Low dose chemotherapy or maintenance chemotherapy given within 7 days of planned study enrollment is permitted. These include hydroxyurea, 6-meraptopurine, oral methotrexate, vincristine, oral etoposide, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). FLT-3 inhibitors can also be given up to 3 days before conditioning regimen\n* All patients with prior radiation treatment to the lung, liver, and kidney will be excluded. For other scenarios of prior radiation treatment, up to 2000 cGy at 2 Gy per day will be allowed. Inclusion of patients with previous radiation exposure will be determined based on the radiation oncologist medical doctor (MD) evaluation and judgment\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to study agent\n* Patients with other active malignancies are ineligible for this study, other than non-melanoma skin cancers\n* Patients should not have any uncontrolled illness including ongoing or active bacterial, viral or fungal infection\n* The recipient has a medical problem or neurologic/psychiatric dysfunction which would impair his/her ability to be compliant with the medical regimen and to tolerate transplantation or would prolong hematologic recovery which in the opinion of the principal investigator would place the recipient at unacceptable risk\n* Females only: Pregnant or breastfeeding\n* Any other condition that would, in the investigator's judgment, contraindicate the patient's participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns with clinical study procedures\n* Prospective participants who, in the opinion of the investigator, may not be able to comply with all study procedures (including compliance issues related to feasibility/logistics)\n* DONOR: Evidence of active infection\n* DONOR: Medical or physical reason which makes the donor unlikely to tolerate or cooperate with growth factor therapy and leukapheresis\n* DONOR: Factors which place the donor at increased risk for complications from leukapheresis or granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) therapy could be harvested for bone marrow (BM) if safer for the donor and if approved by principal investigator (PI)\n* DONOR: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive",
