    "inclusion_criteria": "* Age >= 18\n* Prior tissue diagnosis of breast cancer\n* Confirmed diagnosis of leptomeningeal metastases (LM) with positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology for malignancy and meningeal enhancement (type 1A, 1B, and 1C)\n* Radiographic evidence on MRI of leptomeningeal enhancement within the cervical, thoracic or lumbar spine on spinal MRI\n* Life expectancy of at least 6 weeks\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1, 2, or 3\n* Recovery from any neurotoxic effects of prior therapy\n* Platelet count greater than 25 x 10^9/L\n* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than 0.5 x 10^9/L\n* Patients must have adequate liver function, total bilirubin < 2.5 mg/dL, unless elevated total bilirubin is due to elevated indirect bilirubin from known Gilbert's disease, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) =< 3.5 times upper limits of normal; adequate renal function [calculated estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) >= 30 mL/min/ body surface area (BSA)]\n* Patients or legal medical representative must provide written informed consent\n* Patients must have suitable body habitus for placement of transducer arrays\n* Patients must be willing to wear the device for at least 18 hours a day (averaged over monthly)\n* Patients must be willing to return for the scheduled evaluations and perform the required assessments\n* Patients are without other disease or situation which would significantly compromise adequate assessment of safety and feasibility of the TTF\n* Patient willing to start a study treatment with TTF =< 14 days from registration\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Concomitant therapy:\n\n  * Must not be receiving concurrent high-dose methotrexate (>= 3 g/m^2), high dose thiotepa, or high-dose cytarabine (>= 3 g/m^2). Any other systemic chemotherapy, targeted treatment, hormonal or immunotherapy directed at the primary systemic malignancy is permitted\n  * Must not have received radiation therapy (RT) to the brain or spinal cord within 2 weeks of initiation of TTF\n  * Must be at least 1 week from cessation of any prior intrathecal chemotherapy\n* Women of childbearing age who are pregnant or lactating.

The 14-day period should be extended if the investigational agent is known to have delayed toxicity\n* Patients known to be allergic to the hydrophilic gel utilized for transducer attachment\n* Patients with surgical hardware within the planned area of treatment in the spine (e.g., titanium rods, screws, fixation devices)",
