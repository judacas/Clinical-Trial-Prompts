    "inclusion_criteria": "Key Criteria:\n\nParts 1a and 1b (Dose Escalation + Fulvestrant):\n\n* Patient has histological or cytological confirmation of breast cancer.\n* Patient has metastatic disease or locoregionally recurrent disease which is refractory or intolerant to existing therapy(ies) known to provide clinical benefit.\n* Patient has had prior chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, or other therapy as follows:\n\n  * Minimum of one prior line of therapy for advanced/metastatic disease.\n  * Maximum of five prior lines of therapy for advanced/metastatic disease.\n  * Recurrence or progression on at least one line of endocrine therapy in the advanced/metastatic disease setting.\n  * Prior treatment has included a CDK4/6 inhibitor.\n* Tumor is ER+ (defined as ER IHC staining > 0%).\n\nCohort EMNK:\n\n* Patient has undergone treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy and an anti-PD-1/L1 agent, if appropriate.\n* Tumor has a known KRAS-activating mutation; Patients with KRAS G12C mutations are excluded.\n\nCohort EMBF:\n\n* Patient has had prior chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, or other therapy as follows:\n\n  * Minimum of one prior line of therapy for advanced/metastatic disease.\n  * Maximum of five prior lines of therapy for advanced/metastatic disease.\n  * Recurrence or progression on at least one line of endocrine therapy in the advanced/metastatic disease setting, which may include combination therapy (eg, with a CDK4/6 inhibitor).\n* Tumor is ER+ (defined as ER IHC staining > 0%) and has FGFR amplification.\n\nCohort EMBH:\n\n* Patient has had prior chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, or other therapy as follows:\n\n  * Minimum of one prior line of therapy for advanced/metastatic disease.\n  * Minimum of one line of HER2-directed therapy Note: Prior treatment with CDK4/6 inhibitors is permitted.\n* Tumor is ER+ (defined as ER IHC staining > 0%) and HER2+ (defined as HER2 3+ IHC staining or HER2 2+ and FISH+).\n\nCohort ECNS:\n\n* Patient has histologically or cytologically confirmed stage IIIB (pleural or pericardial effusion) or stage IV NSCLC.\n* Patient has undergone treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy and an anti-PD-1/L1 agent, if appropriate. Note: Patients who have declined approved therapy(ies) or who per treating physician are not eligible for approved therapy(ies) (eg, due to intolerance) may be eligible following discussion with the Medical Monitor.\n* Tumor has a known G12C KRAS-activating mutation. Note: Patients who have been previously treated with KRAS-specific therapy are excluded.\n\nCohort ECBF:\n\n* Patient has had prior chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, or other therapy as follows:\n\n  * Minimum of one prior line of therapy for advanced/metastatic disease.\n  * Maximum of five prior lines of therapy for advanced/metastatic disease.\n  * Recurrence or progression on at least one line of endocrine therapy in the advanced/metastatic disease setting.\n  * Prior treatment has included a CDK4/6 inhibitor.\n* Tumor is ER+ (defined as ER IHC staining > 0%).\n\nCohort ECBF+A:\n\n* Patient has had prior chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, or other therapy as follows:\n\n  * Minimum of one prior line of therapy for advanced/metastatic disease.\n  * Maximum of five prior lines of therapy for advanced/metastatic disease.\n  * Recurrence or progression on at least one line of endocrine therapy in the advanced/metastatic disease setting.\n* Tumor is ER+ (defined as ER IHC staining > 0%) and HER2- (defined as absence of HER2 3+ IHC staining and/or absence of FISH+).\n\nCohort ECBT:\n\n* Patient has progressed after treatment with at least one approved anti-HER2 agent and has been administered at least one line of chemotherapy.\n* Tumor is HER2+ (defined as HER2 3+ IHC staining or HER2 2+ and FISH+). Cohorts EMBF, EMBH, ECBF, ECBF+A: There is no limit on the number of lines of prior endocrine therapies.\n\nCohort ECBF-D1:\n\n* Patient has metastatic disease or locoregionally recurrent disease which is refractory or intolerant to existing therapy(ies) known to provide clinical benefit.\n* Patient has had prior chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, or other therapy as follows:\n\n  * Minimum of one prior line of therapy for advanced/metastatic disease.\n  * Maximum of five prior lines of therapy for advanced/metastatic disease.\n  * Recurrence or progression on at least one line of endocrine therapy in the advanced/metastatic disease setting.\n  * Prior treatment has included a CDK4/6 inhibitor.\n* Tumor is ER+ (defined as ER IHC staining > 0%).\n* Tumor has amplification of Cyclin D1 as determined by next generation sequencing or in situ hybridization.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
