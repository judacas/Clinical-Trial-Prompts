(Note: CD123 measurement will be conducted using the 10-color Beckman Coulter Navios XL flow cytometer. We will use CD123 PE [Beckman Coulter #A32535] to gate the abnormal population of interest. This population will be compared to the internal negative control population [e.g., T-cells]. If more than 20% of the abnormal population is positive relative to this control, it will be classified as positive.)\n* Any conditioning regiment or GVHD prophylaxis is allowed\n* Any donor (i.e., match related/unrelated, mismatched, haploidentical, etc.) or graft source (i.e., bone marrow, mobilized peripheral blood stem cells, etc.) is allowed\n* Prior treatment with CD123-therapy is allowed if no progression is documented on therapy\n* Agreement by females and males of childbearing potential to use an effective method of birth control or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course of the study through at least 6 months after the last dose of protocol therapy\n\n  * Childbearing potential defined as not being surgically sterilized (men and women) or have not been free from menses for > 1 year (women only)\n* STUDY MAINTENANCE TREATMENT: Complete response (CR) or MRD-positive on day 30 bone marrow biopsy (BMB) for disease assessment\n* STUDY MAINTENANCE TREATMENT: Patients must be fully engrafted after HCT before starting the first cycle of maintenance.
