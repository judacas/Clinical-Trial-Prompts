    "inclusion_criteria": "* Subject has provided informed consent.\n* Diagnosis of multiple myeloma per IMWG criteria(26)\n* Patients must have progressive disease following 3 or more prior lines of therapy.\n\n  * Prior treatment must include a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory agent (IMiD), and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody.\n  * Patients must not be candidates for regimens known to provide clinical benefit in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma based on the investigator's judgement.\n  * If a patient declines such therapy, this must be recorded in the study files. 4. Subjects must have measurable disease, including at least one of the criteria below:\n  * SPEP demonstrating M-protein quantities ≥ 0.5 g/dl\n  * UPEP demonstrating monoclonal protein ≥ 200 mg/24hr\n  * Involved serum free light chain levels > 100 mg/L and an abnormal kappa/lambda (κ/λ)ratio\n  * For patients with immunoglobulin class A (IgA) myeloma whose disease can only be reliably measured by quantitative immunoglobulin measurement, a serum IgA level ≥ 500 mg/dl will qualify as measurable disease\n  * Non-secretory participants are eligible provided the participant has > 20% bone marrow plasmacytosis\n* Adequate organ function:\n\n  * Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.0 x 10^9/L without growth factor support for 7 days\n  * Platelets (plt) ≥ 50 x 10^9/L without transfusion for 7 days.\n  * Hemoglobin ≥ 8.0 g/dl, transfusion support permitted\n  * Aspartate aminotransferase (AST/SGOT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT/SGPT) ≤ 3.0x upper limit of normal (ULN)\n  * Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN\n  * Estimated serum creatinine clearance of ≥ 45 mL/min using the Cockcroft-Gault equation or directly calculated from the 24-hour urine collection method.\n  * International normalized ratio (INR) < 1.5 x ULN and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) < 1.5 x ULN\n  * Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction by ECHO or MUGA of ≥ 40%.\n  * Participants must have a performance status of 0-2 based on ECOG criteria.\n  * For people of child bearing potential negative serum or urine pregnancy test (sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL) at screening\n\nExclusion Criteria\n\n* Known hypersensitivity or allergy to ascorbic acid or melphalan\n* Participants must not have a concurrent malignancy unless it can be adequately treated by non- chemotherapeutic intervention. Participants may have a history of prior malignancy, provided they have not had any chemotherapy within 365 days of study entry AND their life expectancy exceeds 5 years with respect to the concurrent malignancy at the time of study entry.\n* Participants must not have life-threatening comorbidities.\n* Known human immunodeficiency virus(HIV) disease (requires negative test for clinically suspected HIV infection).\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, recent (within 6 months) myocardial infarction, uncontrolled or symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, uncontrolled hypertension on appropriate therapy or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* Concurrent use of Coumadin (warfarin)\n* Patients with G6PD deficiency\n* Patients with a history of oxalate renal stones or a known history of multiple renal stones\n* Diabetic patients who rely on a glucometer to dose insulin as ascorbate can interfere with glucometer readings\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
