All sexually active volunteers born male, regardless of reproductive potential, must be willing to use an effective method of contraception (such as consistent condom use) from the day of first vaccination until at least 4 months after the last vaccination to avoid exposure of partners to investigational product in ejaculate and to prevent conception with female partners\n10. Willing to forgo donations of blood, or any other tissues during the study and, for those who test HIV-positive due to vaccine-induced antibodies, until the anti-HIV antibody titers become undetectable\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 50 Years",
