    "inclusion_criteria": "* Newly diagnosed and pathologically-confirmed AML, confirmed by a bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy and/or peripheral blood with >= 20% myeloid blasts. Bone marrow biopsy, or aspirate or peripheral blood that were obtained up to 3 weeks before signing consent are allowed for purposes of confirming AML diagnosis for eligibility purposes. Secondary AML (that is arising from prior myelodysplastic syndrome [MDS] as well as therapy-related [t]-AML) are also allowed. Clarifications: AML arising from myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), MPN/MDS overlap (including chronic myelomonocytic leukemia [CMML]) or another myeloid malignancy are NOT allowed. Note 1: Patients must have evidence of bone marrow involvement on aspirate or biopsy. Patients with only extramedullary disease and no bone marrow involvement will be excluded. Note 2: Every effort should be made to get an aspirate for central flow assessment at screening and all subsequent required time points, but in cases where an aspirate cannot be collected-including dry taps-the patient will not be excluded and assessments will be performed on peripheral blood (PB) which should be collected at every time that bone marrow (BM) is collected. Note 3: Some patients with AML require initiation of therapy quickly after diagnosis, and full metaphase karyotype results in some centers can take 2-3 weeks to result. To avoid this issue being an impediment to accrual to study or to cause delays in initiation of therapy in patients who need fast initiation of therapy, we allow use of karyotype and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) results (as well as FLT3 results) on samples from blood or marrow that were obtained up to 3 weeks before signing consent for purposes of eligibility and stratification. In any case, results from FISH or karyotype should show if core-binding factor (CBF) abnormalities are present by time of randomization as the presence of CBF abnormalities is a required stratification factor\n* Age >= 18 and =< 75 years\n\n  * Because no dosing or adverse event (AE) data are currently available on the use of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in patients < 18 years of age, children are excluded from this study, but will be eligible for future pediatric trials\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =< -2\n* The patient has to be eligible to receive intensive \"7+3\" induction chemotherapy as judged by the treating physician\n* Prior use of hypomethylating agents (HMA), lenalidomide, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), and growth factors is allowed if used to treat prior MDS.

Assessment of the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) is not required to enroll in the study unless there is clinical suspicion for CNS involvement. However, if CSF assessment is performed for any reason, there should be no evidence of active leukemia in the CSF as per investigator judgement. Up to one dose of prophylactic intrathecal chemotherapy is allowed prior to study enrollment. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least four weeks prior to the first dose of protocol treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using steroids for at least 7 days prior to protocol treatment. This exception does not include carcinomatous meningitis which is excluded regardless of clinical stability\n* Patients with active autoimmune disease except for patients with hypothyroidism and vitiligo that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e., with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs).
