Patients that have uncontrolled intercurrent illness, including but not limited to:\n\n   * Ongoing or active infection requiring treatment with anti-infective therapy administered less than two weeks prior to first dose.\n   * Symptomatic congestive heart failure (Grade III or IV as classified by the New York Heart Association), unstable angina pectoris, or symptomatic untreated cardiac arrhythmia. Treated and/or asymptomatic cardiac arrythmia/atrial fibrillation will be allowed.\n   * History of arterial thrombosis or pulmonary embolism within 6 months before the first dose of study treatment.\n   * History of myocardial infarction within 6 months before the first dose of study treatment.\n   * Uncontrolled hypertension defined as systolic blood pressure ≥160 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥100 mm Hg, despite optimal medical management.\n   * Prolonged QTc interval at baseline of ≥470 milliseconds using Fridericia's QT correction formula.\n   * Ongoing or recent (within one year of screening) evidence of significant autoimmune disease that required treatment with systemic immunosuppressive treatments, which may suggest risk for immune-related adverse events (irAEs).\n   * History of Grade 3 or higher irAEs that led to treatment discontinuation of a checkpoint inhibitor. A patient with irAEs below Grade 3 that led to discontinuation should be discussed with the sponsor.
