Adequate renal function (creatinine clearance estimated using the Cockcroft-Gault equation of >/= 51 mL/min: Estimated creatinine clearance = (140-age [years]) x weight (kg) (xF)a / serum creatinine (mg/dL) x 72 [a where F=0.85 for females and F=1 for males.]\n4.

Prior apheresis of >/= 3 million CD34+ cells/Kg.\n\nEligibility for ASCT is determined by the above inclusion criteria 3-7.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 65 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Persistent toxicities (>Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event (CTCAE) grade 2) caused by previous cancer therapy, excluding alopecia.\n2.

Patients who are known to be serologically positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).\n7. Patients receiving any systemic chemotherapy or radiotherapy (except for palliative reasons) within 3 weeks prior to study treatment\n8. Pregnancy\n9. Other malignancy within the last 5 years except: adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer, curatively treated in situ cancer of the cervix, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), Stage 1, grade 1 endometrial carcinoma, or other solid tumors.\n10. Resting ECG with QTcF > 470 msec on 2 or more time points within a 24 hour period or family history of long QT syndrome.\n11. Concomitant use of known strong CYP3A inhibitors (eg. itraconazole, telithromycin, clarithromycin, protease inhibitors boosted with ritonavir or cobicistat, indinavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, boceprevir, telaprevir) or moderate CYP3A inhibitors (eg. ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, diltiazem, fluconazole, verapamil).
