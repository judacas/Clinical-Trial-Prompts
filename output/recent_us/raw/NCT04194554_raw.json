In addition to the above, it is recommended that the male participant uses a condom throughout this period to prevent their partner from possibly being exposed to the study drug(s) via sperm.\n* Male participants must not freeze or donate sperm from the time of enrollment, during the Treatment Period, and for at least 6 months after the final study drug(s) administration\n* Female participants must not donate, or retrieve for their own use, ova from the time of enrollment, during the Treatment Period, and for at least 10 months after the final study drug(s) administration\n* Is willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, drug administration plan, laboratory tests, other study procedures, and study restrictions\n\nDose-escalation Phase:\n\n* Has progressed or was non-responsive to available therapies and for which no standard or available anticancer therapy exists\n* Has a pathologically documented HER2-expressing (eg, breast cancer) or HER2-mutated (eg, non-small cell lung cancer [NSCLC]) solid tumor (participants with gastric cancer or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma are not eligible)\n\nDose-expansion Phase:\n\n* Pathologically documented breast cancer that:\n\n  * Has a history of low HER2 expression, defined as IHC 2+/in situ hybridization negative (ISH-) or IHC 1+ (ISH- or untested) according to American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists (ASCO/CAP) 2018 HER2 testing guidelines\n  * Is hormone receptor (HR)-positive or HR-negative (HR-positive for estrogen receptor or progesterone receptor if finding of ≥1% of tumor cell nuclei are immunoreactive), as defined by ASCO/CAP HR testing guidelines\n  * Has been treated with at least 1 and at most 2 prior lines of chemotherapy in the recurrent or metastatic setting. If recurrence occurred within 6 months of (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy, (neo)adjuvant therapy would count as 1 line of chemotherapy\n  * Was never previously HER2-positive (IHC 3+ or IHC 2+/ISH+) on prior pathology testing (per ASCO/CAP guidelines) or was historically HER2 IHC 0 only\n  * Was never previously treated with anti-HER2 therapy\n  * Documented radiologic progression (during or after most recent treatment)\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Has had prior treatment with an anti-CD47 or anti-signal regulatory protein α (SIRPα) therapy.\n* Has an inadequate treatment washout period prior to start of study treatment, defined as follows:\n\n  * Major surgery: ≤4 weeks or ≤2 weeks for low-invasive cases (eg, colostomy)\n  * Radiation therapy including palliative stereotactic radiation to chest: ≤4 weeks\n  * Palliative stereotactic radiation therapy to other anatomic areas: ≤2 weeks\n* Received any systemic agent from a previous treatment regimen or clinical study within the specified time frame prior to administration of study treatment as specified in the protocol\n* Medical history of myocardial infarction (MI) within 6 months before study enrollment, symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF) (New York Heart Association [NYHA] Class II to IV\n* Has a QT interval corrected with Fridericia's formula (QTcF) prolongation to >470 ms (females) or >450 ms (males) based on average of the screening triplicate 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG)\n* Has a history of (non-infectious) interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis that required steroids, has current ILD/pneumonitis, or where suspected ILD/pneumonitis cannot be ruled out by imaging at Screening\n* Has spinal cord compression or clinically active central nervous system metastases, defined as untreated and symptomatic, or requiring therapy with corticosteroids or anticonvulsants to control associated symptoms\n* Has multiple primary malignancies within 3 years, except adequately resected non-melanoma skin cancer, curatively treated in-situ disease, other solid tumors curatively treated, or contralateral breast cancer\n* Has a history of severe hypersensitivity reactions to either the drug substances or inactive ingredients in the drug products or other monoclonal antibodies\n* Has an uncontrolled infection requiring intravenous (IV) antibiotics, antivirals, or antifungals\n* Is requiring concomitant use of chronic systemic (IV or oral) corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medications during the study\n* Has received a live, attenuated vaccine (messenger ribonucleic acid [mRNA] and replication-deficient adenoviral vaccines are not considered live, attenuated vaccines) within 30 days prior to first exposure to study drug(s)\n* Has substance abuse or any other medical conditions such as clinically significant cardiac or psychological conditions, that may, in the opinion of the investigator, interfere with the participant's participation in the clinical study or evaluation of the clinical study results.\n* Has active primary immunodeficiency or active human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection as determined by plasma HIV ribonucleic acid (RNA) viral load and CD4 count.
