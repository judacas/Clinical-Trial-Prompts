Thus, patients with metastatic disease must have at least 1 lesion, not previously irradiated, that can be accurately measured at baseline as >= 10 mm in the longest diameter (except lymph nodes which must have a short axis >= 15 mm) with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and that is suitable for accurate repeated measurement as per RECIST v1.1 guidelines.\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1/\n* Life expectancy of >= 12 weeks.\n* Patients must be ineligible for or refuse cisplatin-based chemotherapy.

Evidence of post-menopausal status or negative urinary or serum pregnancy test for female pre-menopausal patients. Women will be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrheic for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. The following age-specific requirements apply:\n\n  * Women < 50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal treatments and if they have luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone levels in the post-menopausal range for the institution or underwent surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy).\n  * Women >= 50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments, had radiation-induced menopause with last menses > 1 year ago, had chemotherapy-induced menopause with last menses > 1 year ago, or underwent surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or hysterectomy)\n* Subject is willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study including undergoing treatment and scheduled visit and examinations and follow-up.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
