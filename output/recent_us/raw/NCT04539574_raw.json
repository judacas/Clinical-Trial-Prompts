    "inclusion_criteria": "Inclusion criteria:\n\n1. Signed and dated written informed consent form (ICF) in accordance with International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use - Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP) and local legislation prior to admission to the trial.\n2.

Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of an advanced and/or metastatic non-squamous Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\n4. Documented Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) mutation in the Tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) as per local lab results.\n5. An archival tumor tissue sample must be submitted to the central laboratory after inclusion of the patient to retrospectively confirm the HER2 status. If no archival tissue is available, this may be acceptable in exceptional cases after written agreement with the sponsor.\n6. Patients who have not received any systemic treatment for unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic disease and are not eligible for curative therapy.\n7. Presence of at least one measurable lesion according to Response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) 1.1, as determined by the local site investigator/radiology assessment.\n8. Eligible to receive treatment with the selected platinum-based doublet-chemotherapy (i.e. cisplatin/pemetrexed or carboplatin/pemetrexed) and pembrolizumab in accordance with the Summaries of Product Characteristics (SmPC)/Product Information.\n\nFurther inclusion criteria apply.\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\n1. Previous or concomitant malignancies other than the one treated in this trial within the last 5 years, except;\n\n   * effectively treated non-melanoma skin cancers\n   * effectively treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix\n   * effectively treated ductal carcinoma in situ\n   * other effectively treated malignancy that is considered cured by local treatment\n2. Tumors with targetable alterations with approved available therapy.\n3. Lung-specific intercurrent clinically significant severe illness based on investigators assessment.\n4. Patients who must or wish to continue the intake of restricted medications or any drug considered likely to interfere with the safe conduct of the trial.\n5. Major surgery (major according to the investigator's assessment) performed within 4 weeks prior to randomization or planned within 6 months after screening, e.g. hip replacement.\n6. Any history of or concomitant condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would compromise the patient's ability to comply with the trial or interfere with the evaluation of the safety and efficacy of the test drug.\n7. History or presence of cardiovascular abnormalities such as uncontrolled hypertension, congestive heart failure New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification of ≥ III or IV, unstable angina or poorly controlled arrhythmia which are considered as clinically relevant by the investigator. Myocardial infarction, stroke, or pulmonary embolism within 6 months prior to randomization.\n8. Any clinically important abnormalities (as assessed by the investigator) in rhythm, conduction, or morphology of resting electrocardiograms, e.g. complete left bundle branch block, third degree heart block.\n\nFurther exclusion criteria apply.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
