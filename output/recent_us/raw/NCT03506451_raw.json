    "official_title": "Phase 1 Dose-Escalation and Dose-Expansion Study of the Safety and Efficacy of CS1 CAR-T (WS-CART-CS1) in Subjects With Multiple Myeloma",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma after 3 or more prior lines of therapy, including proteasome inhibitor (e.g. bortezomib or carfilzomib), anti-CD38 therapy (e.g. daratumumab), and anti-BCMA therapies (e.g. BCMA bispecific antibodies or BCMA CAR-T)\n* Measurable disease, defined as meeting at least one of the following criteria:\n\n  * Serum M-protein ≥ 0.5 g/dL\n  * Urine M-protein ≥ 200 mg/24 h\n  * Serum FLC assay: involved FLC level ≥10 mg/dL (100 mg/L) with abnormal serum FLC ratio\n  * A biopsy-proven plasmacytoma\n  * Bone marrow plasma cells > 30% of total bone marrow cells\n* At least 18 years of age.\n* ECOG performance status ≤ 1\n* Adequate renal, hepatic, respiratory, and cardiovascular function, as defined below:\n\n  * Renal function:\n\n    * calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min/1.73 m2 OR\n    * radioisotope glomerular filtration rate ≥ 50 mL/min/1.73 m2 OR\n    * normal serum creatinine based on age/gender per institutional normal range\n  * Hepatic function:\n\n    * ALT (SGPT) ≤ 5 x ULN for age\n    * Total bilirubin ≤ 2.0 x IULN (unless the patient has Grade 1 bilirubin elevation due to Gilbert's disease or a similar syndrome involving slow conjugation of bilirubin)\n  * Respiratory function:\n\n    * Minimum level of pulmonary reserve defined as oxygen saturation > 91% measured by pulse oximetry on room air\n  * Cardiovascular function:\n\n    * LVEF ≥ 45% confirmed by echocardiogram or MUGA within 28 days of screening\n* The effects of CS1 CAR-T on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (at least 2 forms of contraception, including one barrier method) prior to study entry and for 12 months after CS1 CAR-T infusion. If a female subject or female partner of a male subject becomes pregnant during therapy or within 12 months following WS-CART-CS1 infusion, the investigator must be notified in order to facilitate outcome follow-up.\n* Ability to understand and willingness to sign an IRB-approved written informed consent document (or that of legally authorized representative, if applicable).\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Any prior systemic therapy for multiple myeloma within 14 days before planned day of leukapheresis.\n* A history of other malignancy with the exception of treated non-melanomatous skin cancers and malignancies for which all treatment was completed at least 2 years before registration and the subject has no evidence of disease.\n* Currently receiving any other investigational agents.\n* Receipt of any cellular therapy within 8 weeks prior to the planned start of conditioning.\n* A history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to CS1 CAR-T or other agents used in the study.\n* History of Grade 3 CRS or ICANS with other CAR-Ts (including BCMA CAR).\n* Active hepatitis B, active hepatitis C, any uncontrolled infection, or HIV infection.\n* Ongoing or active infection or other serious underlying medical condition that would impair the ability to receive protocol treatment.\n* Pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 14 days of study entry.",
