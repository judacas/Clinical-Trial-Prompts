Tubal ligation must be confirmed with medical records of the actual procedure.\n\n  * Women of childbearing potential should be willing to use 2 methods of birth control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course of the study through 180 days after the last dose of study medication. Participants of childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not been free from menses for > 1 year.\n\nNote: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the established and preferred contraception for the patient.\n\n* Male participant agrees to use an adequate method of contraception starting with the first dose of study treatment through 90 days after the last dose of study treatment.

    "exclusion_criteria": "Participants who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded:\n\n* Known germline or somatic BRCA mutation-positive status\n* Known active brain metastases or LMD (leptomeningeal disease).
