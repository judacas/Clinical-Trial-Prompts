ECHO/MUGA not required at screening unless history of significant cardiac history.\n  * QTc prolongation > 500 msec\n* Uncontrolled or significant pulmonary disease including but not limited to the following:\n\n  * Obstructive or restrictive lung disease requiring home oxygen\n  * Hospitalization with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation within the last 6 months\n  * History or concurrent condition of interstitial lung disease of any severity\n  * Prior history of pneumonitis of grade II or higher, regardless of cause\n  * Patients with diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) who are compliant with prescribed therapy (nocturnal O2, CPAP or BiPAP) are allowed on study\n* Uncontrolled or significant infectious disease including but not limited to the following:\n\n  * Ongoing treatment for systemic bacterial, fungal or viral infection at screening\n  * Subjects are not excluded for antimicrobial, antifungal or antiviral prophylaxis if other inclusion/exclusion criteria are met\n  * Active cytomegalovirus (CMV) or Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection (i.e., subjects with known history of detectable viral load)\n  * Infection with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or human T-lymphotropic virus type 1\n  * Subjects with a positive hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] or hepatitis C antibody [HCV Ab] will be excluded, unless documented treatment and resolution of hepatitis C treatment Subjects with a positive hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) must have negative hepatitis B virus (HBV) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) assay to be eligible, must receive prophylaxis with entecavir (or equivalent) concomitant with duvelisib treatment, and must be periodically monitored for HBV reactivation by institutional guidelines. If unable to receive prophylaxis, then case will be discussed with investigators to determine eligibility.\n  * History of tuberculosis treatment within 2 years prior to enrollment\n* Patients with history of encephalitis, meningitis, or uncontrolled seizures in the year prior to informed consent\n* Ongoing chronic treatment with immunosuppressants (e.g. cyclosporine) or systemic steroids > 10mg of prednisone or equivalent once daily. Topical and inhaled steroids are allowed.\n* Subjects with other uncontrolled medical conditions or other illnesses, laboratory findings or other factors that would, in the investigator's judgment, increase the risk to the subject associated with his or her participation in the study.\n* Patients who are receiving other investigational therapies will be excluded\n* Patients who had a history of life-threatening toxicity related to prior immune therapy (e.g. anti-CTLA-4, anti-PD1 or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation or immune checkpoint pathways) except those that are well controlled an unlikely to be an issue with standard countermeasures (e.g. endocrine disorders managed by hormone replacement).\n* Subjects with a history of grade II or greater immune-mediated colitis. Patients whose toxicity was clearly attributable to anti-CTLA-4 treatment (tolerated anti-PD1 after receiving anti-CTLA4) may still be allowed on trial.\n* Subjects with a history of grade II or greater pneumonitis or transaminitis.\n* Prior treatments with PI3K inhibitors\n* Subject has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment. Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that has undergone therapy with curative intent, or treated in situ cervical cancer for which there is appropriate ongoing surveillance\n* Subject had therapy with radiation, surgery or chemotherapy within 4 weeks prior to time of consent and/or has not recovered from adverse events to due to prior therapy. Subjects should be adequately recovered from all toxicities, complications, or acute illnesses prior to starting investigational therapy.\n* A maximum of three patients who have received talimogene laherparepvec (T-vec) as prior therapy will be allowed to enroll in the Phase II portion of the study. However, study-related biopsies must be performed at a disease site that was not injected with T-vec or adjacent to a T-vec injection site.\n* Subjects who are unable or unwilling to take prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jirovecii, human simplex virus (HSV) or herpes zoster (VZV) at time of screening\n* Subjects with known hypersensitivity to duvelisib and/or its excipients: Microcrystalline cellulose and magnesium stearate\n* Prisoners or subjects who are involuntarily incarcerated\n* Subjects who are compulsorily detained for treatment of either a psychiatric or physical illness\n* Subjects who are unable or unwilling to comply with restrictions and prohibited activities and treatments\n* Subjects who are unable or unwilling to undergo venipuncture or tolerate venous access\n* Subjects with prior surgery and/or chronic gastrointestinal dysfunction that may affect drug absorption, such as gastric bypass, gastrectomy, malabsorption, inflammatory bowel disease, chronic diarrhea\n* Concurrent administration of medications or foods that are strong inhibitors of inducers of cytochrome p450 3A (CYP3A) within 2 weeks prior to study intervention. Duvelisib can increase exposure to CYP3A4 substrates; consider dose reduction of such substrates and monitor for signs of toxicities of co-administered sensitive CYP3A substrates.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
