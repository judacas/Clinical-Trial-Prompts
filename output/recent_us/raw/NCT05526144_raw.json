Women will be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrheic for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. The following age-specific requirements apply:\n\n  * Women <50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal treatments and if they have luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone levels in the post-menopausal range for the institution or underwent surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy).\n  * Women ≥50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments, had radiation-induced menopause with last menses >1 year ago, had chemotherapy-induced menopause with last menses >1 year ago, or underwent surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or hysterectomy).\n* Highly effective contraception for both male and female subjects throughout the study and for at least 5 months after the last dose of study therapy for females and 7 months after the last dose for males if the risk of conception exists.\n* Recovery to baseline or ≤ Grade 1 CTCAE v.5 from toxicities related to any prior treatments, unless AE(s) are clinically non-significant and/or stable on supportive therapy.\n* Able to provide informed consent and willing to sign an approved consent form that conforms to federal and institutional guidelines.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Prior EGFR targeted therapy.\n* Prior radiation therapy within 2 weeks prior to cycle one day one.\n* Active or prior autoimmune disease that might deteriorate when receiving an immunostimulatory agent.

Leptomeningeal metastases are not allowed.\n\n  * Patients with asymptomatic brain metastasis are allowed if previous steroid treatment was discontinued ≥ 6 weeks.\n  * Patients with stable brain metastases on osimertinib therapy are eligible.\n  * Palliative radiation therapy is allowed while on study therapy (see Section 6.4).\n* The subject has uncontrolled, significant intercurrent or recent illness including, but not limited to, the following conditions:\n\n  * Patients with known history or current symptoms of cardiac disease, or history of treatment with cardiotoxic agents, should have a clinical risk assessment of cardiac function using the New York Heart Association Functional Classification. To be eligible for this trial, patients should be class 2B or better.\n  * Myocardial infarction, severe angina, or unstable angina within 6 months prior to administration of first dose of study drug.\n  * Uncontrolled symptomatic hypertension that cannot be controlled with anti-hypertensive agents.\n  * History of serious ventricular arrhythmia (i.e., ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation).\n  * Cardiac arrhythmias requiring anti-arrhythmic medications (except for atrial fibrillation that is well controlled with anti-arrhythmic medication).\n  * Coronary or peripheral artery bypass graft within 6 months of screening.\n  * Corrected QT interval (QTc) prolongation > 500 msec.\n  * Active, clinically symptomatic left ventricular failure (left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) < 50%).\n  * Other clinically significant disorders that would preclude safe study participation.\n* Known HIV infection with a detectable viral load within 6 months of the anticipated start of treatment.\n\n  -Note: Patients on effective anti-retroviral therapy with an undetectable viral load within 6 months of the anticipated start of treatment are eligible for this trial.\n* Known chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection with a detectable viral load.\n\n  -Note: Patients with an undetectable HBV viral load on appropriate suppressive therapy are eligible.
