    "official_title": "Phase 2 Dose-Rising Study of SOR007 Ointment for Actinic Keratosis",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Signed informed consent.\n* Men and women with actinic keratosis.\n* Age 45-85.\n* Women who have had surgical sterilization or are post-menopausal (absence of menses for at least one year) are eligible. Women of child-bearing potential who are non-pregnant, non-nursing, and willing to avoid pregnancy during the course of the study and during the menstrual cycle following completion of their participation in the study are eligible. (Adequate contraception is defined as regular use of diaphragm with condoms, IUD with condoms, or systemic contraceptives if used for at least three months prior to enrollment in the study.) A negative pregnancy test is required as an entry criteria. Women must continue to use the method of contraceptive for at least 30 days after the last administration of study drug.\n* Male subjects must agree to sexual abstinence or use adequate contraception when sexually active in combination with their female partners, if they are of childbearing potential. That means the volunteer must be vasectomized or use a condom and his female partner must either be surgically sterile (hysterectomy or tubal ligation) or agree to use a reliable method of contraception with a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly such as implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, or non-DalKon Shield IUDs. This applies from signing of informed consent form until 90 days after the last study drug administration. Methods of contraception must have been effective for at least 30 days on the day of signing of informed consent. Male volunteers must also refrain from sperm donation from the time of singing informed consent form until 90 days after the last study drug administration.\n* Presence of 4-8 AK lesions total in a 25 cm2 area identified on the face through transparency mapping and photographs. The face area will be defined from hair line to jaw line. The scalp will not be included. An imaginary normal hair line will be the upper boundary for bald men.\n* Able to refrain from the use of all other topical medications to the facial area during the treatment period.\n* Considered reliable and capable of understanding their responsibility and role in the study.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 45 Years\nMust have maximum age of 85 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* History of allergy or hypersensitivity to paclitaxel.\n* Lesions that are thicker than 1 mm or larger than 9 mm will not be included in the lesion counts.\n* Lesions suspicious for squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, or melanoma will not be included in lesion counts and cannot be in the 25 cm2 area of treatment.\n* Abnormal pre-existing dermatologic conditions which might affect the normal course of the disease (e.g. albinism or chronic vesiculobullous disorders).\n* Positive urine pregnancy test in women of child-bearing potential.\n* Inability to use adequate birth control measures for men or women of child-bearing potential, as defined above.\n* Serious psychological illness.\n* Significant history within the past year of alcohol or drug abuse.\n* During the 30 day period preceding study entry: Participating in any clinical research; using topical paclitaxel for AK; using any other topical agents including but not limited to actinex, glycolic acid products, alpha-hydroxy acid products, and chemical peeling agents for the treatment of AK; using any systemic steroids or topical corticosteroids, having cryosurgery.\n* Use of sun lamps or sun tanning beds or booths during the 2 weeks prior to first application and until final visit.\n* Prior treatment with systemic paclitaxel or systemic cancer therapy within 6 months of study entry.\n* Medical history which, based on the clinical judgment of the Investigator implied an unlikelihood of successful completion of the study.",
