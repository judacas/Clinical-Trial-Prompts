    "official_title": "A New Method for Identifying Sensory Changes in Painful Chemotherapy-induced Peripheral Neuropathy (CIPN): a Feasibility Study",
    "inclusion_criteria": "Group A: Painful CIPN group\n\n* Age >18\n* Distal symmetric pain distribution (both feet, with or without pain in hands).\n* The pain appeared during or up to 12 weeks after treatment with oxaliplatin, cisplatin, paclitaxel, docetaxel or any combination of these.\n* Score of 4 or more on Douleur Neuropathique 4 (DN4) neuropathic pain questionnaire\n* Pain duration > 2 months.\n* Patient report of average daily pain intensity in the last week â‰¥3 on 0-10 Numerical Rating Scale (NRS).\n* Able and willing to sign an Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved written informed consent.\n\nGroup B: Control group:\n\n* Age >18\n* History of cancer diagnosis, previously treated with at least 8 infusions of chemotherapy regimen that included oxaliplatin or at least 6 infusions of chemotherapy regimen that included cisplatin, paclitaxel, docetaxel, or any combination of these.\n* No ongoing pain in distal symmetric distribution (subjects with symptoms and signs such as mild numbness, or vibration sensation loss are eligible to be included in the control group).\n* Able and willing to sign an IRB-approved written informed consent. * Subjects in the control group will be matched by the type of previous chemotherapy to the subjects in the Painful CIPN group. An additional attempt will be made to match controls by sex, age, cancer diagnosis, and cumulative neurotoxic chemotherapy dose.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* History of pre-existing painful distal symmetric polyneuropathy prior to chemotherapy.\n* Alternative etiology exists for the distal painful symptoms.\n* Current or previous treatment with a vinca alkaloid (e.g. vincristine, vinblastine), bortezomib, or another agent which may cause major peripheral neurotoxicity.\n* Pregnant\n* Concomitant medication as follows:\n* Patients receiving chronic daily opioids, topical lidocaine or topical capsaicin will be excluded.\n* Patients receiving as needed (PRN) analgesics, including acetaminophen, NSAIDs or short-acting opioids, will be required not to take them 48h before testing, at for at least five half-lives of the specific analgesic, at the discretion of the investigators.",
