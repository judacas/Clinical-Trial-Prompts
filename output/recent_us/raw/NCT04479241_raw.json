Have acceptable coagulation status:\n\n    1. Prothrombin time (PT) within 1.5x normal limits\n    2. Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) within 1.5x normal limits\n12. Be nonfertile or agree to use an adequate method of contraception. Sexually active patients and their partners must use an effective method of contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; or abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation and for at least 3 months (males) and 6 months (females) after the last study drug dose. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.\n13. Have read and signed the Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved informed consent form (ICF) prior to any study related procedure. (In the event that the patient is re-screened for study participation or a protocol amendment alters the care of an ongoing patient, a new ICF must be signed.)\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. History of congestive heart failure (CHF); cardiac disease, myocardial infarction within the past 6 months prior to Cycle 1 Day 1; left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <45% by echocardiogram (ECHO), unstable arrhythmia, or evidence of ischemia on electrocardiogram (ECG) within 14 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1\n2. Have a corrected QT interval (using Fridericia's correction formula) (QTcF) of >450 msec in men and >470 msec in women\n3. Have a seizure disorder requiring anticonvulsant therapy\n4. Presence of symptomatic central nervous system metastatic disease or disease that requires local therapy such as radiotherapy, surgery, or increasing dose of steroids within the prior 2 weeks\n5. Have severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with hypoxemia (defined as resting O2 saturation of ≤90% breathing room air)\n6. Have undergone major surgery, other than diagnostic surgery, within 2 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day 1\n7. Have active, uncontrolled bacterial, viral, or fungal infections, requiring systemic therapy\n8. Are pregnant or nursing\n9. Received treatment with radiation therapy, surgery, chemotherapy, or investigational therapy within 28 days or 5 half lives, whichever occurs first, prior to study entry (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or Mitomycin C)\n10. Are unwilling or unable to comply with procedures required in this protocol\n11. Have known infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B, or hepatitis C. Patients with history of chronic hepatitis that is currently not active are eligible.\n12. Have a serious nonmalignant disease (eg, hydronephrosis, liver failure, or other conditions) that could compromise protocol objectives in the opinion of the investigator and/or the sponsor\n13. Are currently receiving any other investigational agent\n14. Have exhibited allergic reactions to a similar structural compound, biological agent, or formulation\n15. Have undergone significant surgery to the gastrointestinal tract that could impair absorption or that could result in short bowel syndrome with diarrhea due to malabsorption\n16. Have hemochromatosis or a transferrin saturation (TS) >50% in men or >45% in women at baseline or noted during the study via scheduled iron panel monitoring",
