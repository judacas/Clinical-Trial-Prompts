    "inclusion_criteria": "Cohort A: Must fall into one of the three categories defined as high risk of developing pancreatic cancer and are undergoing pancreatic surveillance AND 2) have documented radiographic evidence of a pancreatic abnormality such as a pancreatic cyst.\n\n* High Risk Group 1 (familial pancreatic cancer relatives):\n\n  * >/=55 years old or 10 years younger than the age of youngest relative with pancreatic cancer, and\n  * Come from a family with 2 or more members with a history of pancreatic cancer (2 of which have a first-degree relationship consistent with familial pancreatic cancer), and\n  * Have a first-degree relationship with at least one of the relatives with pancreatic cancer.\n  * If there are 2 or more affected blood relatives, at least 1 must be a first-degree relative of the individual being screened.\n* High Risk Group 2 (Germline mutation carriers with an associated with an estimated lifetime risk of pancreatic cancer of ~10% or higher):\n\n  * >/=40 years old and the Patient is a carrier of FAMMM (p16/CDKN2A) mutation regardless of family pancreas cancer history.\n\nOR\n\n* >/= 50 years old or 10 years younger than the age of the youngest relative with pancreatic cancer, and the Patient is a carrier of a known BRCA2, ATM, PALB2 mutation.\n* Persons with known genetic mutation should have proof of mutation status. Those who had research-related genetic testing must have confirmation by a clinical CLIA-certified laboratory.\n\n  o High Risk Group 3 (Germline mutation carriers with an associated with an estimated lifetime risk of pancreatic cancer of ~5%):\n* >/= 50 years old or 10 years younger than the age of the youngest relative with pancreatic cancer, and\n* The patient is a carrier of a known, BRCA1, or HNPCC (hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer or Lynch syndrome, hMLH1, hMSH2, PMS1, hMSH6, EpCAM) gene mutation, and there is > 1 pancreatic cancer in the family, one of whom is a first- or second-degree relative of the subject to be screened.\n* Persons with known genetic mutation should have proof of mutation status. Those who had research-related genetic testing must have confirmation by a clinical CLIA-certified laboratory.\n* Cohort A: Patients must have a pancreatic imaging abnormality that is being followed by pancreatic imaging surveillance (EUS and/or MRI and /or CT), such as a pancreatic cyst consistent with an IPMN or parenchymal abnormalities consistent with PanIN.\n\n  * Cohort B: Patients must have clinical, radiographic, or histologic evidence of pancreatic cystic neoplasm with high-risk features warranting surgical resection per the discretion of the treating hepatobiliary surgeon.\n  * Cohort B: Patients must have cystic fluid testing that demonstrates the presence of one of the six KRAS mutations included in the study vaccine.\n* Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function defined by study-specified laboratory tests prior to initial study drug.\n* Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n* Woman of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test and follow contraceptive guidelines as defined per protocol.\n* Men must use acceptable form of birth control while on study.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 40 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* If expected to require any other form of systemic or localized antineoplastic therapy while on study.\n* Within 4 weeks prior to first dose of study drug.\n\n  o Any systemic or topical corticosteroids at immunosuppressive agents.\n* Within 4 weeks prior to first dose of study drug.\n\n  * Any investigational device.\n  * Has received a live vaccine.\n  * Received any allergen hyposensitization therapy.\n  * Any major surgery.\n* Infection with HIV or hepatitis B or C.\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, uncontrolled infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina, cardiac arrhythmia, metastatic cancer, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements monoclonal antibody.\n* Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency.\n* Any other sound medical, psychiatric, and/or social reason as determined by the Investigator.\n* Unwilling or unable to follow the study schedule for any reason.\n* Are pregnant or breastfeeding.",
