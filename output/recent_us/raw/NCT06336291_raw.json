    "official_title": "A Phase II Study of Nivolumab Combined With Bicalutamide and Ipilimumab in Metastatic HER2-negative Breast Cancer",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* ECOG performance status of 0-1;\n* Metastatic or locally advanced unresectable HER2-negative breast cancer (by NCCN criteria);\n* Triple Negative Breast Cancer tumors will require confirmation of androgen-receptor (AR) positivity at screening (refer to laboratory manual for guidelines). Local testing permitted for eligibility if reviewed by a designated study pathologist;\n* RECIST1.1 measurable disease;\n* Participants must be willing (if clinically feasible) to provide a fresh tumor biopsy (or archived tissue). For archived tissue, a tissue block from the most recent biopsy is acceptable if no intervening anti-neoplastic therapies have been administered since the time of biopsy.\n* Previous systemic chemotherapy: no greater than one line of previous chemotherapy in non-curative setting; subjects with metastatic progression within 1 year following completion of curative-intent chemotherapy are eligible if they have not received any additional lines of systemic therapy in the non-curative setting.\n* Participants must have signed and dated an IRB/IEC approved written informed consent form in accordance with regulatory and institutional guidelines. This must be obtained before the performance of any protocol related procedures that are not part of normal patient care.\n* Participants must be willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment schedule, laboratory tests, tumor biopsies, and other requirements of the study\n* Adequate hematologic and liver function (using CTCAE v4). (All baseline laboratory requirements will be assessed and should be obtained within 14 days prior to enrollment): WBC≥2000/μL; Neutrophils≥1500/μL; Platelets≥100 × 103/μL; Hemoglobin ≥9.0 g/dL; AST≤3 × ULN; ALT ≤3 × ULN; Total bilirubin ≤1.5 × ULN (except in participants with Gilbert Syndrome, who can have total bilirubin < 3.0 mg/dL). Subjects with elevations in LFTs related to underlying hepatic cancer involvement may be considered for enrollment (after discussion with lead PI) if ALT/AST is ≤5 x ULN and Total bilirubin ≤3 × ULN.\n* Female and Age ≥18 years. (Men are excluded because of potential confounding effects of sex on correlative analyses)\n* Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 24 hours prior to the start of study treatment.\n* Women must not be breastfeeding\n* Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must agree to follow instructions for method(s) of birth regulation for the duration of treatment with study treatment(s) for a total of 5 months post-treatment completion.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be FEMALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Active brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases. Participants with brain metastases are eligible if these have been treated and there is no magnetic resonance imaging (MRI except where contraindicated in which CT scan is acceptable) evidence of progression for at least 2 weeks after treatment is complete and within 28 days prior to first dose of study drug administration. Cases must be discussed with the lead PI, Dr. Page. Brain lesions are not considered measurable disease.\n* Prior malignancy active within the previous 3 years except for locally curable cancers that have been apparently cured, such as basal or squamous cell skin cancer, or carcinoma in situ of the cervix. Subjects with prior history of unrelated breast cancer not requiring active therapy may be considered for enrollment, but require discussion with and approval of PI;\n* Any serious or uncontrolled medical disorder that, in the opinion of the investigator, may increase the risk associated with study participation or study drug administration, impair the ability of the participant to receive protocol therapy, or interfere with the interpretation of study results.\n* Participants must have recovered from the effects of major surgery requiring general anesthetic or significant traumatic injury at least 14 days before enrollment.\n* Participants with active, known or suspected autoimmune disease. Participants with vitiligo, type I diabetes mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only requiring hormone replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger are permitted to enroll.\n* Participants with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (> 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study drug administration. Inhaled or topical steroids and adrenal replacement doses > 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease.\n* Uncontrolled adrenal insufficiency.\n* New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Classification of Heart Failure: Class III or Class IV\n* All toxicities attributed to prior anti-cancer therapy other than alopecia and fatigue must have resolved to Grade 1 (NCI CTCAE version 4) or baseline before administration of study drug. Participants with toxicities attributed to prior anti-cancer therapy which are not expected to resolve and result in long lasting sequelae, such as peripheral neuropathy grade 2 or less, are permitted to enroll\n* Known history of positive test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or known acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, unstable angina pectoris, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit obtaining informed consent or compliance with study requirements.\n* Participants who have had a history of acute diverticulitis, intra-abdominal abscess, GI obstruction and abdominal carcinomatosis which are known risk factors for bowel perforation.\n* Participants with interstitial lung disease that is symptomatic or may interfere with the detection or management of suspected drug-related pulmonary toxicity.\n* Has known active hepatitis B (e.g. HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g. HCV RNA is detected);\n* History of allergy or hypersensitivity to study drug components\n* Prior treatment with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CD137, or anti-CTLA-4 antibody in the metastatic setting, or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation or checkpoint pathways. Previous treatment with anti-PD-1/L1 in the curative setting is allowed if subjects have not received such therapy within one year of screening.\n* Prior treatment with bicalutamide, enzalutamide, or any other androgen receptor blocker.\n* Use of an investigational agent within 4 weeks of Day 1 visit",
