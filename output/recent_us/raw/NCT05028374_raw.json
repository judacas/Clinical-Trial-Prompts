DLBCL; ii. High-grade B-cell lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements; iii. Transformed FL or transformed marginal zone lymphoma (MZL); iv. Follicular lymphoma Grade 3B\n* R/R disease after at least 2 lines of prior treatment, which must have included:\n* -An Anti-CD20 MoAb and an anthracycline for DLBCL, high-grade B-cell lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements, primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL), or transformed FL or MZL\n* -An alkylating agent in combination with an anti-CD20 MoAb for FL\n* -An anthracycline or bendamustine-containing chemotherapy regimen and a Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor for mantle cell lymphoma (MCL)\n* -Autologous anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy, if approved and available for the indicated lymphoma subtype, unless the subject is unable or is ineligible to receive approved autologous anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy (e.g., fail leukapheresis or manufacture, unable to wait for manufacture, CD19 negative disease, etc.)\n* Autologous hematopoietic stem cells must be available prior to the start of the LD regimen if the subject is considered high-risk for prolonged hematologic toxicity\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 80 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Prior use of an investigational product (except for cell or gene therapies and MoAbs) within 5 half-lives or within 14 days, whichever is shorter, prior to start of LD regimen\n* Previous approved therapy including chemotherapy, biologic (except MoAbs), or targeted therapy for R/R B-NHL with 5 half-lives or within 14 days, whichever is shorter, prior to start of the LD regimen\n* Prior MoAb therapy (approved or investigational) within 30 days prior to start of LD\n* Prior systemic immunostimulatory agent within 3 half-lives prior to start of the LD regimen\n* Prior cell or gene therapy (approved or investigational) within 6 weeks of the start of LD\n* Prior cell or gene therapy (approved or investigational) targeting both CD20 and CD22\n* Autologous HSCT infusion within 6 weeks of the start of LD\n* Allogeneic HSCT within 3 months of the start of LD, or donor lymphocyte infusion within 6 weeks of the start of LD\n* Active acute or chronic graft versus host disease (GvHD). Subjects should be off all immunosuppressive therapies for at least 6 weeks prior to start of LD\n* Radiotherapy within 8 weeks (except for palliative radiotherapy for specific on-target lesions) (prior to start of LD regimen)\n* Evidence of active central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma or previous CNS involvement of R/R B-NHL\n* Presence of an active and clinically relevant CNS disorder\n* Daily treatment with >20 mg prednisone or equivalent\n* Known active infection, or reactivation of a latent infection, whether bacterial or viral, fungal, mycobacterial, or other pathogens\n* History of hypersensitivity to alemtuzumab\n* History of neutralizing anti-drug antibody against alemtuzumab\n* Any known uncontrolled cardiovascular disease within 3 months of enrollment\n* Subjects requiring immunosuppressive treatment\n* Major surgery within 28 days prior to start of LD\n* Evidence of another uncontrolled malignancy within 2 years prior to Screening (except in situ nonmelanoma skin cell cancers and/or carcinoma in-situ of the cervix)",
