Willing and able to participate in all required evaluations and procedures in this study protocol\n13. Contraception: Each female subject of childbearing potential must agree to use a highly effective method of contraception (i.e., a method with less than 1% failure rate per year [e.g., sterilization, hormone implants, hormone injections, some intrauterine devices, vasectomized partner, or combined birth control pills]) from screening until 6 months after the last dose of EP0057 or Olaparib, whichever was taken last. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at Screening and a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 24 hours prior to EP0057 dosing on Day 1 of each Cycle (and must not be lactating). Each female subject will be considered to be of childbearing potential unless she has been surgically sterilised by hysterectomy or bilateral tubal ligation/salpingectomy or has been postmenopausal for at least 1 year.\n\n    Cohort 1 patients (Phase 2A and 2B) must be/have:\n14.

Received at least 1 prior line of treatment, 1 of which must be platinum-based chemotherapy\n17. Received a PARP inhibitor in the maintenance setting as their most recent treatment following a confirmed response by RECIST1.1 (CR or PR) to the last regimen which must be a platinum-based chemotherapy, with maintenance of response by PARP inhibitor lasting ≥ 6 months, with subsequent confirmed disease progression as defined by RECIST v1.1 criteria\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be FEMALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Non-epithelial tumour of the ovary, the fallopian tube or the peritoneum\n2. Ovarian tumours of low malignant potential or low grade\n3.
