Written informed consent obtained from the patient/legal representative prior to performing any protocol-related procedures, including screening evaluation.\n2. Newly diagnosed, untreated, biopsy proven non-small cell lung cancer.\n3. Medically inoperable or patient refusal to surgery as defined by any single of the following criteria: a. Determined unfit for surgery by thoracic surgeon or radiation oncologist as documented in the medical record b. Pulmonary function test (PFTS) showing Forced Expiratory Volume in the first second (FEV1) ≤ 1.2 L or diffusing Lung Capacity (DLC) <60%, c. Poor exercise tolerance or failed pre-operative cardiac work-up, d. Patient refusal to undergo definitive surgery as documented in clinical note by a surgeon, pulmonologist, medical oncologist, or radiation oncologist.\n4. Clinically stage I disease by American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 7th edition. (N0, M0, T stages T1-T2a) or patients with stage T2bN0M0 (clinical stage IIA) disease who are medically unfit for standard of care chemotherapy as documented by a medical oncologist or radiation oncologist, or who refuse standard of care chemotherapy as documented by a medical oncologist or radiation oncologist.\n5. Age > 18 years at time of study entry.\n6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 - 1.\n7. Adequate normal organ and marrow function as defined below:\n\n   * Haemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL.\n   * Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 109/L (> 1500 per mm3).\n   * Platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L (>100,000 per mm3).\n   * Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN). <<This will not apply to subjects with confirmed Gilbert's syndrome (persistent or recurrent hyperbilirubinemia that is predominantly unconjugated in the absence of hemolysis or hepatic pathology), who will be allowed only in consultation with their physician.>>\n   * aspartate aminotransferase (AST) serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT)/ alanine aminotransferase (ALT) serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 x institutional upper limit of normal unless liver metastases are present, in which case it must be ≤ 5x ULN.\n   * Serum creatinine creatinine clearance (CL) >40 mL/min by the Cockcroft-Gault formula (Cockcroft and\n\n   Gault 1976) or by 24-hour urine collection for determination of creatinine clearance:\n\n   Males:\n\n   Creatinine CL (mL/min)\n\n   = Weight (kg) x (140 - Age) . 72 x serum creatinine (mg/dL)\n\n   Females:\n\n   Creatinine CL (mL/min)\n\n   = Weight (kg) x (140 - Age) x 0.85 72 x serum creatinine (mg/dL)\n8.
