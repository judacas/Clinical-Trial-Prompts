    "inclusion_criteria": "* The subjects to be studied will include female patients ages 18 and older of any race, identified as carrying an elevated risk for breast cancer referred to MDACC.\n* High risk may be defined as having a calculated lifetime risk >20%, histopathology of lobular neoplasia or atypical ductal hyperplasia, atypia NOS or a genetic mutation known to predispose the patient to breast cancer.\n* Subject who are scheduled for a Breast MRI who are willing to participate fully in all aspects of the study including completing both a Breast MRI & MBI screening exam within a two-week time window, a biopsy of any positive findings and complete a post examination survey. Consent for the enrollment may be obtained upon scheduling the MRI examination. For non-English speakers, a language interpreter will assist in translation.\n* Written consent will be obtained from all participants to obtain MBI of the breasts and biopsy as indicated, based on findings.
