Female participants of childbearing potential must have a documented negative pregnancy exam within 24 hours prior to dosing.\n* Breastfeeding mothers are not eligible, because there is an unknown risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with BMS-986158 or BMS-986378 (CC-90010).\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to BMS-986158 or BMS-986378 (CC-90010).\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or uncontrolled infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* Patients with a known history of HIV, hepatitis B, and/or hepatitis C (testing not required as part of screening).\n* Patients with gastrointestinal disease or disorder that could interfere with absorption of BMS-986158 or BMS-986378 (CC-90010), such as bowel obstruction or inflammatory bowel disease.\n* For Arm 1: Patients with BSA < 0.3 m2 for all dose levels except Dose Level -2 or -2i for which patients with BSA < 0.71 m2 will be excluded due to dose rounding constraints.\n* For Arm 2: Patients with BSA < 0.65 m2.",
