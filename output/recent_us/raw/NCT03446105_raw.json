    "official_title": "A Phase 3, Open-label, Randomized, Prospective Study of Apalutamide With Continued Versus Intermittent Androgen-Deprivation Therapy (ADT) Following PSA Response in Participants With Metastatic Castration-Sensitive Prostate Cancer (mCSPC)",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Diagnosis of prostate cancer prior to screening with histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate\n* For participants not undergoing Gender-affirming care: Metastatic prostate cancer disease documented by conventional imaging (example, computed tomography [CT], magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], or bone scan) and/or next-generation imaging [NGI] demonstrating greater than equal (>=) 2 distinct extraprostatic sites of metastasis\n* For participants undergoing Gender-affirming care: No evidence of metastasis by either conventional imaging (example, CT, MRI, or bone scan) and/or NGI is also acceptable\n* For participants not undergoing gender-affirming care: testosterone levels > 50 (ng/dL) nanograms per deciliter at screening, except for those who may have received ADT prior to screening. Participants are allowed to have received up to 3 months of (ADT) androgen-deprivation therapy prior to enrollment\n* For participants undergoing Gender-affirming care: There is no testosterone level requirement for inclusion\n* Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) of 0 or 1. Participants with ECOG PS 2 or 3 are eligible for the study if the ECOG PS score is related to stable physical limitations (example, wheelchair-bound due to prior spinal cord injury) and not related to prostate cancer or associated therapy\n* A participant must agree not to plan to conceive a child while enrolled in this study or within 3 months after the last dose of study treatment\n* Must be able to take whole apalutamide tablets by swallowing alone or with another vehicle (example, applesauce)\n* Assigned male at birth, inclusive of all gender identities\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be MALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* History of seizure or known condition that has been determined to significantly predispose to seizure per investigator\n* Pelvic lymph nodes as only site of metastasis\n* Known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to excipients of apalutamide\n* Any of the following within 6 months prior to screening: severe or unstable angina, myocardial infarction, symptomatic congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, clinically significant arterial or venous thromboembolic events\n* Gastrointestinal disorder affecting absorption\n* Participants who have undergone a bilateral orchiectomy with the exception of participants who completed this as part of their gender-affirming care or a result of a variation in physical sex development",
