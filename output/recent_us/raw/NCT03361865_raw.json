    "official_title": "A Phase 1, Three-Part, Open-Label, Parallel-Cohort Safety and Tolerability Study of Relugolix in Combination With Abiraterone Acetate Plus a Corticosteroid, Apalutamide, or Docetaxel With or Without Prednisone in Men With Metastatic Castration-Sensitive Prostate Cancer or Non-Metastatic or Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer",
    "inclusion_criteria": "1. A previous diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the prostate confirmed by histologic or cytologic evidence and with a documented medical history of either:\n\n   * mCSPC (Parts 1, 2, and 3) defined as having at least two of three risk factors at the baseline (Day 1) visit:\n\n     * Total Gleason score of ≥ 6; and\n     * Presence of ≥ 2 metastatic lesions on bone scan; OR\n     * Radiologic evidence of measurable visceral metastases with exception of hepatic metastases.\n   * nmCRPC (Part 2 only) defined as disease progression despite maintaining castration levels of testosterone with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), as evidenced by an increase in consecutive prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentrations (2 measurements, at least one week apart).\n   * mCRPC (Parts 1 and 3) defined as disease progression despite maintaining castration levels of testosterone with ADT:\n\n     * An increase in consecutive PSA (2 measurements at least 1 week apart); or\n     * Worsening clinical symptoms; or\n     * Radiologic evidence demonstrating enlarged metastatic lesions or the development of new metastases.\n2. Initiating treatment or currently receiving treatment of leuprolide acetate (3-, 4-, or 6-month injections [intramuscular Lupron or subcutaneous Eligard]) or another GnRH receptor agonist (triptorelin) or a GnRH receptor antagonist (degarelix or relugolix [maximum duration of 3 months]) in combination with:\n\n   * Part 1: abiraterone acetate 1000 mg or fine-particle abiraterone acetate 500 mg once daily plus prednisone 5 mg once daily for participants with mCSPC or twice daily for participants with mCRPC or methylprednisolone 4 mg once daily and in whom abiraterone has been well tolerated (that is, without evidence of hepatotoxicity requiring dose adjustment for abiraterone).\n   * Part 2: apalutamide 240 mg once daily and in whom apalutamide has been well tolerated (that is, without a fracture, fall, or seizure episode or need to dose adjust due to any adverse events).\n   * Part 3: docetaxel 75 mg/m2 and in whom docetaxel has been well tolerated (that is, no evidence of hypersensitivity reaction, febrile neutropenia or neutrophils < 500 cells/mm3 for more than 1 week, severe or cumulative cutaneous reactions, or moderate neurosensory signs and/or symptoms despite dose reduction). Note: Patients receiving treatment with another agent in addition to docetaxel, such as a steroid synthesis inhibitor or androgen receptor antagonist, may be enrolled.\n\nKey\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be MALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",

Abnormal clinical laboratory test value(s) at the screening visit or prior to the baseline (Day 1) visit including:\n\n   * Serum creatinine > 2.0 mg/dL;\n   * Platelets < 100 × 103/μL;\n   * Hemoglobin < 10.0 g/dL;\n   * Leukocytes (WBC) < 3 × 103/μL;\n   * Absolute neutrophil count < 1.5 × 103/μL;\n   * Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) > 8%; Note (Part 3 only): Transfusions and/or administration of growth factors are permitted as indicated for the clinical management of docetaxel-related hematologic effects and in accordance with the investigator's judgement.\n6. Known hepatic disease, including alcoholic liver disease or viral hepatitis such as hepatitis A (hepatitis A virus IgM positive), chronic hepatitis B (HbsAg positive), or chronic hepatitis C (HCV antibody positive, confirmed by HCV RNA) or clinical signs of hepatic disease such as jaundice;\n7.
