    "inclusion_criteria": "* Depending upon study part, a history or status of: 1) a histologically-confirmed hematological malignancy that is expected to express cluster of differentiation (CD)20; 2) relapse after or failure to respond to at least one prior treatment regimen; and 3) no available treatment options that are expected to prolong survival (e.g., standard chemotherapy or autologous stem cell transplant [ASCT])\n* Measurable disease, defined as at least one bi-dimensionally measurable nodal lesion, defined as > 1.5 cm in its longest dimension, or at least one bi-dimensionally measurable extranodal lesion, defined as > 1.0 cm in its longest dimension\n* Able to provide a tumor tissue pretreatment biopsy at last relapse or during screening from a safely accessible site, per investigator determination, providing the patient has more than one measurable target lesion\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1\n* Life expectancy of >/=12 weeks\n* AEs from prior anti-cancer therapy must have resolved to Grade less than or equal to (</=) 1\n* Adequate liver, hematological and renal function\n* Negative serologic or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test results for acute or chronic Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection\n* Negative test results for Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\n* Negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to study treatment in women of childbearing potential. Women who are not of childbearing potential who are considered to be post-menopausal (at least 12 months of non-therapy amenorrhea) or surgically sterile (absence of ovaries and/or uterus) are not required to have a pregnancy test\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",

Participants with a past history of stroke that have not experienced a stroke or transient ischemic attack in the past 2 years and have no residual neurologic deficits are allowed\n* Evidence of significant, uncontrolled concomitant diseases that could affect compliance with the protocol or interpretation of results, including diabetes mellitus, history of relevant pulmonary disorders and known autoimmune diseases\n* Participants with another invasive malignancy in the last 2 years (with the exception of basal cell carcinoma and tumors deemed by the Investigator to be of low likelihood for recurrence)\n* Significant or extensive history of cardiovascular disease such as New York Heart Association Class III or IV or Objective Class C or D cardiac disease, myocardial infarction within the last 6 months, unstable arrhythmias, or unstable angina\n* Administration of a live, attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks before obinutuzumab infusion or anticipation that such a live attenuated vaccine will be required during the study\n* Received systemic immunosuppressive medications (including but not limited to cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate, thalidomide, and anti-tumor necrosis factor agents) within two weeks prior to obinutuzumab infusion. Treatment with corticosteroid </= 25 mg/day prednisone or equivalent is allowed. Inhaled and topical steroids are permitted\n* Any other diseases, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that would contraindicate the use of an investigational drug\n* History of autoimmune disease, including but not limited to myocarditis, pneumonitis, myasthenia gravis, myositis, autoimmune hepatitis, systemic lupus, erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, vascular thrombosis associated with antiphospholipid syndrome, Wegener's granulomatosis, Sjögren's syndrome, Guillain-Barré syndrome, multiple sclerosis, vasculitis, or glomerulonephritis.
