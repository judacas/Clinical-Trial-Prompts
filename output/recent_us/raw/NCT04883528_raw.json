Males: Vasectomized. If not vasectomized, must use an appropriate contraception method as noted in Section 6.8.1.\n\n     9. Must provide voluntary written informed consent prior to Screening (V1).

The primary caregiver/study partner must be willing to sign the caregiver ICF.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 60 Years\nMust have maximum age of 85 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* 1. Has prior brain imaging inconsistent with probable AD 2. A history of a stroke that resulted in a cognitive or motor deficit or, MRI or CT evidence of a moderate or large cerebral infarct.\n\n  1. Should there be any evidence of neurologic symptoms between the date of the scan confirming diagnosis and Screening (V1), rescanning is necessary.\n\n     3. Has clinically relevant abnormal laboratory tests including serum vitamin B12 deficiency, thyroid function abnormality, severe anemia, or electrolyte abnormality.\n\n     4. Diagnosis of type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes requiring insulin treatment or the need to use continuous glucose monitoring. Subjects who become insulin dependent during the study may not continue to participate in the study.\n\n     5. History of epilepsy or seizure disorder requiring ongoing treatment, or any seizure or loss of consciousness within 12 mo prior to Screening (V1).\n\n     6. Subjects are ineligible, if in the opinion of the investigator, they have deficits in speech, comprehension, auditory functioning, or vision which would adversely impact their ability to perform the study's cognitive test procedures, complete rating scales, or engage in interviews.\n\n     7. Has any of the following laboratory findings at Screening (V1):\n\n  <!-- -->\n\n  1. Alanine aminotransferase >3 × upper limit of normal (ULN), aspartate aminotransferase >3 × ULN, or history of clinically significant liver disease in the Investigator's medical judgment.\n  2. Hemoglobin ≤10 g/dL.\n  3.

History of breast cancer. 11. History of severe heart failure (Grade 2 or higher on the New York Heart Association scale), major stroke, uncontrolled seizure disorder, or other medical illness that, in the Investigator's opinion, will increase the subject's risk of participation in the study or confound study assessments.\n\n     12.

Local anesthesia during outpatient surgery is permitted if, in the opinion of the Investigator, the operation will not interfere with study procedures and subject safety.\n\n     13.
