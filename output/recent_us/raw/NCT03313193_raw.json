    "inclusion_criteria": "* The patient must have consented to participate and must have signed and dated an appropriate IRB-approved consent form that conforms to federal and i institutional guidelines for the pre-entry research core biopsy for CELx HSF testing and for initiating chemotherapy\n* Patients must be female.\n* Patients must be ≥ 18 years old.\n* Patient must have an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1\n* The diagnosis of invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast must have been made by core needle biopsy.\n* The primary breast tumor must be palpable and measure ≥ 1.0 cm on physical exam.\n* The regional lymph nodes can be cN0 or cN1\n* The tumor size can be T1c or T2\n* Ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes must be evaluated by imaging (mammogram, ultrasound, and/or MRI) within 6 weeks prior to initiating chemotherapy. If suspicious or abnormal, FNA or core biopsy is recommended, also within 6 weeks prior to initiating chemotherapy. Findings of these evaluations will be used to determine the nodal status prior to initiating chemotherapy.\n\n  * Nodal status - negative\n\n    * Imaging of the axilla is negative;\n    * Imaging is suspicious or abnormal but the FNA or core biopsy of the questionable node(s) on imaging is negative;\n  * Nodal status - positive\n\n    * FNA or core biopsy of the node(s) is cytologically or histologically suspicious or positive.\n    * Imaging is suspicious or abnormal but FNA or core biopsy was not performed.\n* Tumor specimen obtained at the time of diagnosis must have estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PR) receptors < 10%.\n* Tumor specimen obtained at the time of diagnosis must have been determined to be HER2-negative as follows:\n\n  * Immunohistochemistry (IHC) 0-1+; or\n  * IHC 2+ and ISH non-amplified with a ratio of HER2 to CEP17 < 2.0, and if reported, average HER2 gene copy number < 4 signals/cells; or\n  * ISH non-amplified with a ratio of HER2 to CEP17 < 2.0, and if reported, average HER2 gene copy number < 4 signals/cells.\n* Blood counts performed within 6 weeks prior to initiating chemotherapy must meet the following criteria:\n\n  * Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) must be ≥ 1200/mm3;\n  * platelet count must be ≥ 100,000/mm3; and\n  * hemoglobin must be ≥ 10 g/dL.\n* The following criteria for evidence of adequate hepatic function performed within 6 weeks prior to initiating chemotherapy must be met:\n\n  * total bilirubin must be ≤ upper limit of normal (ULN) for the lab unless the patient has a bilirubin elevation > ULN to 1.5 x ULN due to Gilbert's disease or similar syndrome involving slow conjugation of bilirubin; and\n  * alkaline phosphatase must be ≤ 2.5 x ULN for the lab; and\n  * AST must be ≤ 1.5 x ULN for the lab.\n  * Alkaline phosphatase and AST may not both be > the ULN. For example, if the alkaline phosphatase is > the ULN but ≤ 2.5 x ULN, the AST must be ≤ the ULN. If the AST is > the ULN but ≤ 1.5 x ULN, the alkaline phosphatase must be ≤ ULN. Note: If ALT is performed instead of AST (per institution's standard practice), the ALT value must be ≤ 1.5 x ULN; if both were performed, the AST must be ≤ 1.5 x ULN.\n* Patients with AST or alkaline phosphatase > ULN are eligible for inclusion in the study if liver imaging (CT, MRI, PET-CT, or PET scan) performed within 6 weeks prior to initiating chemotherapy does not demonstrate metastatic disease and the requirements in criterion 4.2.13 are met.\n* Patients with alkaline phosphatase that is > ULN but ≤ 2.5 x ULN or unexplained bone pain are eligible for inclusion in the study if a bone scan, PET-CT scan, or PET scan performed within 6 weeks prior to initiating chemotherapy does not demonstrate metastatic disease.\n* Serum creatinine performed within 6 weeks prior to initiating chemotherapy must be ≤ 1.5 x ULN for the lab.\n* The left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) assessment by echocardiogram or MUGA scan performed within 90 days prior to initiating chemotherapy must be ≥ 50% regardless of the facility's lower limit of normal (LLN).\n* Patients with reproductive potential must agree to use an effective non-hormonal method of contraception during therapy, and for at least 7 months after the last dose of study therapy.\n* Patients are candidates for weekly paclitaxel and carboplatin chemotherapy as determined by treating physician.\n* Patients with multifocal breast cancer are included as long as none of the tumors are HER2 positive by IHC or FISH and targeted lesion meets current inclusion criteria.\n* Conditions for patient eligibility (Study Enrollment) A patient cannot be considered eligible for this study unless all of the following conditions are met:\n* The patient must have consented to participate and must have signed and dated an appropriate IRB-approved consent form that conforms to federal and institutional guidelines for the FACT-2 study treatment.\n* Tumor determined to have abnormal HER2-driven signaling activity based on the CELx HSF test.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* T3 or T4 tumors including inflammatory breast cancer.\n* FNA alone to diagnose the breast cancer.\n* Excisional biopsy or lumpectomy performed prior to initiating chemotherapy.\n* Surgical axillary staging procedure prior to initiating chemotherapy. Pre- neoadjuvant therapy sentinel node biopsy is not permitted. (FNA or core biopsy is acceptable.)\n* Definitive clinical or radiologic evidence of metastatic disease. Required imaging studies must have been performed within 6 weeks prior to initiating chemotherapy.\n* Synchronous bilateral invasive breast cancer. (Patients with synchronous and/or previous contralateral DCIS or LCIS are eligible.)\n* Any previous history of ipsilateral invasive breast cancer or ipsilateral DCIS. (Patients with synchronous or previous ipsilateral LCIS are eligible.)\n* Previous therapy with anthracycline, taxanes, trastuzumab, or other HER2 targeted therapies for any malignancy.\n* Any sex hormonal therapy, e.g., birth control pills, ovarian hormone replacement therapy, etc. (These patients are eligible if this therapy is discontinued prior to initiating chemotherapy.)\n* History of non-breast malignancies (except for in situ cancers treated only by local excision and basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin) within 2 years prior to initiating chemotherapy.\n* Cardiac disease (history of and/or active disease) that would preclude the use of the drugs included in the treatment regimens.
