A woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) who has a positive urine pregnancy test (e.g., within 8 days) prior to treatment will be excluded from the study. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test result within 8 days prior to initiation of study treatment. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because atezolizumab is a monoclonal antibody agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with atezolizumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with atezolizumab. These potential risks may also apply to selinexor. Due to the potential risks, WOCBPs and men must agree to use highly effective contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and 5 months after completion of atezolizumab administration or 3 months after completion of selinexor administration, whichever is longer.
