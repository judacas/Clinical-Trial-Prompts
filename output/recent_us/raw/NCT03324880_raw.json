If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required\n* RECIPIENTS: Agreement by females and males of childbearing potential* to use an effective method of birth control (hormonal or barrier method) or abstain from heterosexual activity prior to study entry and for up to 90 days post-HCT.\n\n  * Childbearing potential defined as not being surgically sterilized (men and women) or have not been free from menses for > 1 year (women only)\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 75 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* DONORS: Any prior transplant to day 1 of protocol therapy\n* DONORS: Chemotherapy, radiation therapy, biological therapy, immunotherapy within 21 days prior to day 1 of protocol therapy\n* DONORS: Receipt of any vaccine (licensed or investigational) within 30 days prior to and after of the study vaccine\n* DONORS: Unfit to undergo standard stem cell mobilization and apheresis e.g. abnormal blood counts, history of stroke, uncontrolled hypertension\n* DONORS: Sickling hemoglobinopathy including hemoglobin S (HbSS), sickle cell trait (HbAS), hemoglobin sickle C disease (HbSC)\n* DONORS: Donors with impaired cardiac function are excluded. Electrocardiography is routine for potential HCT donors over 60 years old and those with a history of heart disease. Subjects in whom cardiac function is abnormal (excluding 1st degree branch block, sinus bradycardia, sinus tachycardia or non-specific T wave changes) are ineligible for Triplex vaccination\n* DONORS: Positive for HIV, active hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C (HCV) or human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV-I/II)\n* DONORS: Severe psychiatric illness. Mental deficiency sufficiently severe as to make compliance with the donation procedure unlikely, and making informed consent impossible\n* DONORS: Females only: Pregnant or breastfeeding\n* DONORS: Any other condition that would, in the investigator's judgment, contraindicate the patient's participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns with clinical study procedures\n* DONORS: Prospective participants who, in the opinion of the investigator, may not be able to comply with all study procedures (including compliance issues related to feasibility/logistics)\n* RECIPIENTS: Any prior investigational CMV vaccine\n* RECIPIENTS: Experimental anti-CMV chemotherapy in the last 6 months\n* RECIPIENTS: Prior allogeneic (allo) transplant for any condition\n* RECIPIENTS: Live attenuated vaccines\n* RECIPIENTS: Medically indicated subunit (Engerix-B for HBV; Gardasil for HPV) or killed vaccines (e.g. influenza, pneumococcal, or allergy treatment with antigen injections)\n* RECIPIENTS: Allergy treatment with antigens injections\n* RECIPIENTS: Alemtuzumab or any equivalent in vivo T-cell depleting agent\n* RECIPIENTS: Antiviral medications with known therapeutic effects on CMV such as valganciclovir/ganciclovir (GCV/VAL), foscarnet (FOS), cidofovir, brincidofovir (CMX-001), maribavir. Acyclovir has no known therapeutic efficacy against CMV and is allowable as standard of care to prevent herpes simplex virus (HSV)\n* RECIPIENTS: Prophylactic therapy with CMV immunoglobulin or prophylactic antiviral CMV treatment\n* RECIPIENTS: Other investigational product - concurrent enrollment in other clinical trials using any investigational new drug (IND) drugs with unknown effects on CMV or with unknown toxicity profiles is prohibited\n* RECIPIENTS: Other medications that might interfere with the evaluation of the investigational product\n* RECIPIENTS: Diagnosis with autoimmune disease\n* RECIPIENTS: Females only: Pregnant women and women who are lactating. The risks of Triplex to pregnant women are unknown. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother. Breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is enrolled on this study\n* RECIPIENTS: Any other condition that would, in the investigator's judgment, contraindicate the patient's participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns with clinical study procedures\n* RECIPIENTS: Prospective participants who, in the opinion of the investigator, may not be able to comply with all study procedures (including compliance issues related to feasibility/logistics)",
