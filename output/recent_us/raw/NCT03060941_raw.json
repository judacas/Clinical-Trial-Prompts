    "official_title": "A Phase II Study of the Impact of Clinicogenetic Risk-Stratified Management on Outcomes of Acute Myeloid Leukemia in Older Patients",
    "inclusion_criteria": "Inclusion criteria:\n\n1. A new diagnosis of de novo, secondary or treatment-related AML, other AML equivalent such as myeloid sarcoma, myelodysplastic syndrome in transformation to AML, or high-grade treatment-related myeloid neoplasm\n2. Patients aged ≥60 years\n3. Karnofsky Performance Status ≥60%\n4. Subjects must be able and willingly give signed informed consent\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\n1. Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Patients with brief exposure to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), arsenic trioxide (ATO) or similar product for suspected APL, who later turn out not to have APL, are eligible for the study.\n2. Relapsed or refractory AML, who require salvage therapy\n3. Prior exposure to decitabine or azacitidine will be an exclusion criterion for the use of decitabine or azacitidine alone.\n4. Patients, who require urgent initiation of chemotherapy (other than debulking agent such as hydroxyurea or cyclophosphamide) due to leukemia-related emergencies such as leukostasis, or disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. Patients will not be excluded solely based on prior use of debulking agent. Prior or current use of leukapheresis will be allowed.\n5. Uncontrolled serious infection at the time of enrollment. Infections are considered controlled if appropriate therapy has been instituted and, at the time of enrollment, patients do not have signs of infection progression. Progression of infection is defined as hemodynamic instability attributable to sepsis, new symptoms, worsening physical signs or radiographic findings attributable to infection. Persisting fever without other signs or symptoms will not be interpreted as progressing infection\n6. Uncontrolled clinically significant arrhythmia, myocardial ischemia or congestive heart failure within the past 2 weeks, that is considered by the treating physician as a contraindication for initiation of chemotherapy.\n7. Ejection fraction <45% will be an exclusion criteria for intensive chemotherapy. Such patients may receive low intensity therapy.\n8. Clinically significant kidney (e.g. GFR ≤45ml/minute or Creatinine of ≥2 mg/dl) or liver dysfunction (e.g. AST/ALT and/or bilirubin ≥2 times ULN) at the time of enrollment that may prevent from safely using chemotherapy. Such patients may be allowed to receive low-intensity chemotherapy. Patients with elevated bilirubin secondary to Gilbert syndrome will not be excluded.\n9. Any other condition that may not allow safe use of chemotherapy based on the clinical judgment of the treating oncologist.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 60 Years",
