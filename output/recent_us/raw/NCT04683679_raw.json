Allowed anticoagulants are the following:\n\n  1. Prophylactic use of low-dose aspirin for cardio-protection (per local applicable guidelines) and low-dose low molecular weight heparins (LMWH).\n  2. Therapeutic doses of LMWH or anticoagulation with direct factor Xa inhibitors rivaroxaban, or apixaban in subjects without known brain metastases who are on a stable dose of the anticoagulant for at least 1 week before first dose of study treatment without clinically significant hemorrhagic complications from the anticoagulation regimen or the tumor.\n* The subject has prothrombin time (PT)/INR or partial thromboplastin time (PTT) test ≥ 1.3 x the laboratory ULN within 7 days before the first dose of study treatment.\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, the following conditions:\n\n  1. ongoing or active infection\n  2. symptomatic congestive heart failure\n  3. uncontrolled hypertension defined as sustained blood pressure (BP) > 150 mm Hg systolic or > 100 mm Hg diastolic despite optimal antihypertensive treatment\n  4.
