    "inclusion_criteria": "* Subjects ≥18 years of age signing of informed consent;\n* A history of clinical ASCVD, which is defined as: acute coronary syndrome, or a history of MI, stable or unstable angina, coronary or other arterial revascularization, stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or peripheral arterial disease presumed to be of atherosclerotic origin;\n* Clinical diagnosis of type 2 diabetes according to ADA/ CDA guidelines;\n* Subject on stable dose of maximally-tolerated statin therapy for ≥4 weeks prior to screening and LDL-c ≥70mg/dL. For subjects whose maximally tolerated dose of statin is no type or dose (i.e. determined to be statin intolerant by primary investigator), background lipid-lowering therapy is not required;\n* Fasting triglycerides ≤400mg/dL (4.52mmol/L) by central laboratory at screening;\n* Willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan, laboratory tests and other trial procedures;\n* Abnormal urinary Albumin Creatinine Ratio (ACR) as defined by an ACR ≥2;\n* Subject tolerates screening placebo injection.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Personal or family history of hereditary muscular disorders;\n* NYHA III or IV heart failure, or last know left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <30%;\n* Uncontrolled serious cardiac arrhythmia defined as recurrent and highly symptomatic ventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, or supraventricular tachycardia that are not controlled by medications, in the past 6 weeks prior to randomization;\n* Myocardial infarction, unstable angina, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), coronary artery graft (CABG) or stroke within 3 months prior to randomization;\n* Planned cardiac surgery or revascularization;\n* Moderate to severe renal dysfunction, defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <30mL/min/1.73m2 at screening;\n* Type 1 diabetes, poorly controlled type 2 diabetes (HbA1c >10%), newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes (within 6 months of randomization), or laboratory evidence of diabetes during screening (fasting serum glucose ≥126mg/dL [7.0mmol/L] or HbA1c ≥6.5% without prior diagnosis of diabetes;\n* Uncontrolled hypertension, defined as sitting systolic blood pressure (SBP) >160mmHg or diastolic BP (DBP) >100mmHg;\n* Subject who has taken a cholesterol easter transfer protein (CETP) inhibitor in the last 12 months prior to LDL-c screening, such as: anacetrapib, dalcetrapib or evacetrapib;\n* Treatment in the last 3 months prior to LDL-c screening with any of the following drugs: systemic cyclosporine, systemic steroids (e.g. IV, intramuscular [IM], or PO) (Note: hormone replacement therapy is permitted), vitamin A derivatives and retinol derivatives for the treatment of dermatologic conditions (e.g. Accutane); (Note: vitamin A in a multivitamin preparation is permitted). Topical retinol prescription and non-prescription derivatives or creams are permitted;\n* Uncontrolled hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism as defined by thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) <1.0 time the lower limit of normal or >1.5 times the ULN, respectively, at screening. Potential subjects with TSH <1.0 time the lower limit of normal due to thyroid replacement therapy is not considered an exclusion;\n* Active liver disease or hepatic dysfunction, defined as aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) >3 times the ULN as determined by central laboratory analysis at screening;\n* Known active infection or major hematologic, renal metabolic, gastrointestinal or endocrine dysfunction in the judgment of the investigator;\n* Diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism within 3 months prior to randomization;\n* Unreliability as a study participant based on the investigator's (or designee's) knowledge of the subject (e.g. alcohol or other drug abuse);\n* Currently enrolled in another investigational device or drug study, or less than 30 days since ending another investigational device or drug study(s), or receiving other investigational agent(s);\n* Female subject who has either (1) not used at least 1 highly effective method of contraception for at least 1 month prior to screening or (2) is not willing to use such a method during treatment and for an additional 15 weeks after the end of treatment, unless the subject is sterilized or postmenopausal;\n* Subject who is pregnant or breast feeding, or planning to become pregnant during treatment and/ or within 15 weeks after the end of treatment;\n* Use of PCSK9 inhibitor within 10 weeks from screening;\n* Subject who has any kind of disorder that, in the opinion of the investigator, may compromise the ability of the subject to give written informed consent and/or to comply with all required study procedures;\n* Malignancy except non-melanoma skin cancers, cervical or breast ductal carcinoma in situ within the last 5 years;\n* Subject who has known sensitivity to any of the products or components to be administered during dosing;\n* Subject who is likely to not be available to complete all protocol-required study visits or procedures, and/or to comply with all required study procedures to the best of the subject and investigator's knowledge;\n* History or evidence of any other clinically significant disorder, condition or disease (with the exception of those outlined above) that, in the opinion of the principal investigator would pose a risk to subject or interfere with the study evaluation, procedures or completion;\n* Blood donation 4 weeks prior to screening, or stated intention to donate blood or blood products during the period of the study or within one month following completion of the study;\n* Subjects who have participated in other studies within 30 days prior to screening, or have five times the plasma half-life (if known) of the investigational drug, whichever is longer;\n* BMI>40kg/m2.",
