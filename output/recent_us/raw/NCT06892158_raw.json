    "official_title": "A Phase 1 Study of ASP1002 in Participants With Metastatic or Locally Advanced Solid Tumors",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Participant has locally-advanced (unresectable or metastatic solid tumor which is confirmed by available pathology records or current biopsy.\n\n  1. For dose escalation, the participant must P the following malignancies (for all tumor types, any component of neuroendocrine histology is exclusionary):\n\n     I. NSCLC - adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and adenosquamous are included; large cell carcinoma and sarcomatoid carcinoma are excluded.\n\n     Note: NSCLC Not Otherwise Specified will require documented discussion with the medical monitor prior to study entry II. UC II. CRC IV. Prostate adenocarcinoma V. Epithelial ovarian cancer (including fallopian tube cancer) VI. TNBC\n     * TNBC defined as unequivocal TNBC histology (ER 1 negative/progesterone receptor-negative/HER2-negative). This is defined by < 1% expression of ER and progesterone receptor by IHC and that are, for HER2, either 0 to 1+ by IHC, or IHC 2+ and FISH negative (not amplified) as per current ASCO/CAP guidelines [Hammond et al, 2010].\n  2. For dose expansion, the participant must have one of the following malignancies (for all tumor types, any component of neuroendocrine histology is not eligible):\n\n     I. NSCLC - adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and adenosquamous are included; large cell carcinoma and sarcomatoid carcinoma are excluded. Note: NSCLC Not Otherwise Specified will require documented discussion with the medical monitor prior to study entry.\n\n     II. UC III. CRC IV.

Participant should undergo a tumor biopsy during the treatment period as indicated in the schedule of assessments. Note: Tumor tissue collection (at screening/baseline and on-treatment) is optional for participants enrolled initially in dose levels 1 to 3 in dose escalation; however, protocol de-escalation and expansion of dose levels similar to dose levels 1 to 3 may require collection and processing of screening/baseline and on-treatment tumor samples.\n* Participant has at least 1 measurable lesion per RECIST v1.1. Lesions situated in a previously irradiated area are considered measurable if progression has been demonstrated in such lesions.\n* Participant has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Status of 0 or 1.\n* Participants who have received radiotherapy must have completed this therapy (including stereotactic radiosurgery) at least 2 weeks prior to study intervention administration.\n* Participant has predicted life expectancy >/= 12 weeks.\n* Participant has adequate organ function prior to start of study intervention. If a participant has received a recent blood transfusion, the laboratory tests must be obtained >/=2 weeks after any blood transfusion.\n* Female participant is not pregnant and at least 1 of the following conditions apply:\n\n  * a. Not a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP)\n  * b. WOCBP who agrees to follow the contraceptive guidance from the time of informed consent through at least 90 days after final study intervention administration.\n* Female participant must agree not to breastfeed starting at screening and throughout the study period and for 90 days after final study intervention administration.\n* Female participant must not donate ova starting at first administration of study intervention and throughout 90 days after final study intervention administration.\n* Male participant with female partner(s) of childbearing potential (including breastfeeding partner) must agree to use contraception throughout the treatment period and for 90 days after final study intervention administration.\n* Male participant must not donate sperm during the treatment period and for 90 days after final study intervention administration.\n* Male participant with pregnant partner(s) must agree to remain abstinent or use a condom for the duration of the pregnancy throughout the study period and for 90 days after final study intervention administration.\n* Participant agrees not to participate in another interventional study while receiving study intervention in the present study.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Participant weighs < 40 kg.\n* Participant has ongoing toxicity >/= grade 2 per the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 considered clinically significant and attributable to prior antineoplastic therapies.\n* Participant has symptomatic CNS metastases or evidence of uncontrolled CNS disease even if asymptomatic (e.g. progression on scans). Participants with previously treated CNS metastases are eligible, if they are clinically stable and have no evidence of CNS progression by imaging for at least 4 weeks prior to start of study intervention and are not requiring immunosuppressive doses of systemic steroids (equivalent to > 10 mg per day of prednisone) for longer than 2 weeks.\n* Participant has an active autoimmune disease.

Note: Participants with prostate adenocarcinoma who do not have a bilateral orchiectomy should continue androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) during the study. A participant with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), receptor tyrosine kinase (encoded by the gene ROS1), or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) mutation-positive NSCLC is allowed to remain on EGFR tyrosine receptor inhibitor, neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase inhibitor or ALK inhibitor therapy until 4 days prior to the start of study intervention administration.\n* Participant requires or has received systemic steroid therapy or any other immunosuppressive therapy within 14 days prior to ASP1002 administration.
