Female and male patients of reproductive potential must practice highly effective methods of contraception with their partners, if of reproductive potential, during treatment and for 6 months following last dose of rucaparib\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 21 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Ongoing or prior treatment with a PARPi for breast cancer or other malignancies\n2. Receiving concurrent anti-neoplastic therapy for their breast cancer or another malignancy\n3. Known documented or suspected hypersensitivity to the components of the study drug or analogs.\n4. Pre-existing gastrointestinal disorders or defects (like duodenal stent etc) that would, in the opinion of the investigator, interfere with absorption of rucaparib",
