    "exclusion_criteria": "* Pregnant or breast-feeding women will not be entered on this study due to risks of fetal and teratogenic adverse events as seen in animal/human studies. Pregnancy tests must be obtained in girls who are post-menarchal. Males or females of reproductive potential may not participate unless they have agreed to use two effective contraceptive methods for the duration of study treatment. Both female subjects and male subjects with female partners of child-bearing potential must agree to use a highly effective method of contraception for 2 weeks prior to protocol therapy, during, and at least 4 weeks after last dose of tipifarnib. In addition, since tipifarnib could induce toxicity of male reproductive organs and cause impairment of fertility, sperm cryopreservation should be recommended for male subjects wishing to preserve their fertility following tipifarnib treatment\n* Patients receiving corticosteroids who have not been on a stable or decreasing dose of corticosteroid for at least 7 days prior to enrollment are not eligible. If used to modify immune adverse events related to prior therapy, >= 14 days must have elapsed since last dose of corticosteroid\n* Patients who are currently receiving another investigational drug are not eligible\n* Patients who are currently receiving other anti-cancer agents are not eligible\n* Patients who are receiving cyclosporine, tacrolimus or other agents to prevent graft-versus-host disease post bone marrow transplant are not eligible for this trial\n* Patients who are currently receiving drugs that are strong inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4/5 or UGT are not eligible. Strong inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4/5 or UGT should be avoided from 14 days prior to the 1st dose of tipifarnib to the end of the study. In addition, patients receiving agents that are sensitive or narrow therapeutic range substrates of CYP3A4/5 are not eligible.
