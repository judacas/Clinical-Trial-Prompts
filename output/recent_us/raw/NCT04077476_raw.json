Participants who discontinued previous treatment due to unacceptable toxicity are eligible.\n\n     i. Permitted prior ex20ins therapies include: amivantamab, sunvozertinib (DZD9008), and BLU451. Other prior ex20ins--directed treatment may be discussed with the Sponsor for eligibility assessment.\n   * Participants with brain metastasis must be neurologically stable. Participants must have received central nervous system (CNS)-directed therapy and have no evidence of progression for at least 4 weeks after CNS-directed treatment, as ascertained by clinical examination and brain imaging (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] or computed tomography [CT] scan) during the Screening Period. Additionally, they must be on a stable or decreasing dose of corticosteroids and/or anti-convulsant medications for at least 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment. Participants with a history of uncontrolled seizures or LMD are not eligible.\n\n   Cohort B participants:\n   * Documented EGFR ex20instatus, as determined by local testing performed at a CLIA-certified (US) or locally certified laboratory (outside the US).\n   * Participants who have not received prior treatment for advanced or metastatic disease and who are not appropriate candidates for first-line doublet platinum-based chemotherapy based on Investigator judgment or has refused first-line doublet platinum-based chemotherapy following discussion with the Investigator. Prior adjuvant/neoadjuvant treatment for early-stage disease must have been completed >6 months prior to the first dose of study treatment.\n   * Participants with brain metastasis must be neurologically stable. Participants must have received CNS-directed therapy and have no evidence of progression for at least 4 weeks after CNS-directed treatment, as ascertained by clinical examination and brain imaging (MRI or CT scan) during the Screening Period, and they must be on a stable or decreasing dose of corticosteroids and/or anti-convulsant medications for at least 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment. Participants with history of uncontrolled seizures or LMD are not eligible.\n\n   Cohort C participants:\n   * Documented ex20ins or other uncommon single or compound EGFR non-ex20ins status, as determined by local testing performed at a CLIA-certified (US) or locally certified laboratory (outside the US).\n   * Presence of brain metastasis(es) characterized as at least one of the following:\n\n     * Newly diagnosed and/or progressive brain metastasis(es) measurable by Response Assessment in Neuro-oncology Brain Metastases (RANO-BM) criteria and not subjected to CNS-directed therapy, AND/OR\n     * LMD measurable or non-measurable by RANO-BM criteria and confirmed by a positive cerebrospinal fluid cytology, or unequivocal radiographic and/or clinical determination.\n   * Participants may not require other immediate CNS-directed therapy or will likely require other CNS directed anti-tumor therapy during the first cycle of study treatment, as judged by the Investigator.\n\n   Cohort D participants:\n   * Documented other uncommon single or compound EGFR non-ex20ins status (excluding C797S), as determined by local testing performed at a CLIA certified (US) or locally certified laboratory (outside the US). A list of eligible mutations will be provided in a separate document.\n   * Participants with brain metastasis must be neurologically stable. Participants must have received CNS-directed therapy and have no evidence of progression for at least 4 weeks after CNS- directed treatment, as ascertained by clinical examination and brain imaging (MRI or CT scan) during the Screening Period, and they must be on a stable or decreasing dose of corticosteroids and/or anti-convulsant medications for at least 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment. Participants with history of uncontrolled seizures or LMD are not eligible.\n   * Participants who have not received prior systemic therapy for their locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC disease.\n   * Prior adjuvant/neoadjuvant treatment for early-stage disease must have been completed >6 months prior to the first dose of study treatment. Participants may not have received prior adjuvant/neoadjuvant treatment with any EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI).\n4. Measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1).\n5. Archival tumor tissue available for submission, with minimum quantity sufficient to evaluate EGFRmt status and, where possible, other biomarkers (details provided in a laboratory manual). Participants with insufficient tissue may be eligible following discussion with the Sponsor.\n6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) 0 or 17.\n7. Adequate organ function, as defined by the hematologic, renal and hepatic laboratory values.\n8. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum pregnancy test prior to administration of the first dose of study treatment. Female participants are not considered to be of childbearing potential if they are post-menopausal (no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause) or permanently sterile (hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy).\n9. Both males and females of reproductive potential must agree to use effective birth control during the study prior to the first dose of study drug and for 1 month after the last dose of study treatment.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
