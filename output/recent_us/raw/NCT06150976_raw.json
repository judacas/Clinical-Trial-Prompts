Participants who previously only received platinum as a radiosensitizer are not eligible\n  3. Participants must be naÃ¯ve to checkpoint inhibitors\n* Participants who had measurable disease\n* Participants who provide a tumor tissue sample, either from archival tissue or newly obtained core or excisional biopsy. If the participant received local therapy (For example: radiation therapy or chemoradiotherapy) after the archival tissue was taken, a new biopsy was required\n* Participants who had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) PS of 0 to 1\n* Life expectancy greater than or equals to (>=) 12 weeks as judged by the Investigator\n* Adequate hematological, hepatic and renal function as defined in the protocol\n* Participants with known Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infections were in general eligible if the following criteria are met:\n\n  1.

HBV viral load below the limit of quantification. If medically indicated, participants infected with HBV must be treated and on a stable dose of antivirals at study entry and with planned monitoring and management according to appropriate labeling guidance\n  2. Participants with a history of HCV infection should have completed curative antiviral treatment and require HCV viral load below the limit of quantification\n  3. Participants on concurrent HCV treatment should have HCV below the limit of quantification\n* Other protocol defined inclusion criteria could apply\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be FEMALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Participants with active central nervous system (CNS) metastases causing clinical symptoms or require therapeutic intervention are excluded.
