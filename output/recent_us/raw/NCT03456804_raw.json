Prostate cancer with known or suspected recurrent or metastatic disease based on clinical imaging (e.g. CT, bone scan, MRI, ultrasound, FDG PET/CT, FACBC PET/CT) within 12 months of screening. If subject is post curative-intent local treatment (e.g. radical prostatectomy, local radiotherapy, brachytherapy) they must have had no intervening change in cancer treatment.\n\n      OR\n   2. Renal Cell cancer with known or suspected metastatic disease based on clinical imaging (e.g. CT, bone scan, MRI, ultrasound, FDG PET/CT)\n3.

Post-Radiotherapy: PSA level that has not risen from nadir measured over at least 2 consecutive tests\n3. If clinical imaging (e.g. bone scan, CT, MRI, ultrasound, PET/CT) has been done within 3 months of screening as part of standard clinical surveillance it must be negative or equivocal for sites of recurrent or metastatic disease (clinical imaging is not required for enrollment)\n4.
