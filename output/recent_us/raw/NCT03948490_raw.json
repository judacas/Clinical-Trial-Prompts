    "official_title": "A Phase II Trial to Evaluate Functional Imaging in Prediction of Response to Abemaciclib for Advanced Hormone Receptor-Positive, HER2-Negative Breast Cancer",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Men or women with metastatic or locally advanced unresectable breast cancer\n* Histologically confirmed ER+ / HER2-negative, breast cancer who is a candidate for endocrine therapy with pathology from the primary tumor or metastatic/recurrent site. Based on American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists (ASCO CAP) Guidelines: ER+: >= 1% of tumor cell nuclei to be immunoreactive. HER2-negative: HER2 of 0, 1+ by immunohistochemistry (IHC) or negative by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).\n\n  * In the case of bone biopsy which could yield false negative ER or PR status in patients with historically HR+ disease, a patient may be eligible if the treating physician and the study chair both agree that the patient is a candidate for further endocrine therapy (ET) based treatment.\n  * Note that baseline PR status by IHC does not influence results of deltaFFNP-PET imaging.\n* If premenopausal, the patient has to be treated with GnRH agonist for at least 6 weeks prior to FFNP-PET.\n* Disease must be present in at least one non-liver site and measurable by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria and be 1.5 cm or greater in longest dimension OR disease can be non-measurable but must be 1.5 cm in longest dimension on functional imaging (fluorodeoxyglucose [FDG]-PET/computed tomography [CT] preferred).\n* No limits to prior lines of endocrine therapy in the metastatic setting including synergistic targeted therapy such as CDK4/6 inhibitors (other than Abemaciclib), PI3K inhibitor, mTOR inhibitor, etc. One line of prior cytotoxic chemotherapy in the metastatic setting is allowed. Washout from prior systemic anti-cancer therapy of at least 2 weeks from chemotherapy or radiation, 2 weeks or 5 half lives (whichever is longer) from oral selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD), 8 weeks from oral selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), and 16 weeks from intramuscular SERD (Fulvestrant) is required. Recovery of adverse events from the last therapy to grade 1 except alopecia. Patients may continue luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist to remain post-menopausal without a need for washout\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =< 2\n* At least 18 years of age\n* Absolute neutrophil count >= 1,500/uL\n* Platelets >= 100,000/uL\n* Hemoglobin >= 9g/dL\n* Total bilirubin =< 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN).\n\n  * In case of known Gilbert's syndrome, < 2 x ULN is allowed\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) /alanine aminotransferase (ALT) serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) =< 2.5x institutional ULN, or =< 5 x ULN for subjects with documented metastatic disease to the liver\n* eGFR (estimated glomerular filtration rate) â‰¥ 30 mL/min\n* Women of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (barrier method of birth control, abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation\n* Ability to understand and willingness to sign an institutional review board (IRB)-approved written informed consent document (or that of legally authorizes representative, if applicable)\n* Consent to access archival tumor specimens for clinical sequencing data of tumor tissue and blood\n* A history of other malignancy with the exception of malignancies for which all treatment was completed at least 2 years before registration and the patient has no evidence of disease\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Prior abemaciclib in the metastatic setting or within 2 years of completion of adjuvant abemaciclib\n* Hepatic-only metastatic disease\n* Currently receiving any other investigational agents\n* Untreated/unstable brain metastases. Patients with treated/stable brain metastases, defines as patients who have received prior therapy for their brain metastases and whose central nervous system (CNS) disease is radiographically stable at study entry, are eligible\n* A history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to FFNP, abemaciclib, or other agents used in the study\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, or cardiac arrhythmia\n* Pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 14 days of study entry\n* Patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are eligible unless their CD4+ T-cell counts are < 350 cells/mcL or they have a history of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining opportunistic infection within the 12 months prior to registration. Concurrent treatment with effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) according to Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) treatment guidelines is recommended",
