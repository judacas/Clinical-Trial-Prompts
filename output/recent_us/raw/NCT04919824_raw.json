Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >1000/mm3\n  2. Platelets ≥50000//mm3\n  3. Hemoglobin ≥8.0 g/dl\n* Adequate organ function defined as:\n\n  1. a serum creatinine (sCR) based on gender/age as follows: Maximum Serum Creatinine (mg/dL) Age Male Female\n\n     1 to <2 years 0.6 0.6 2 to <6 years 0.8 0.8 6 to <10 years 1.0 1.0 10 to <13 years 1.2 1.2 13 to <16 years 1.5 1.4\n\n     ≥16 years 1.7 1.4\n  2. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) for age\n  3. Total bilirubin <2 mg/dL (for Gilbert's Syndrome patients total bilirubin <4 mg/dL)\n  4. Adequate pulmonary function\n\n  i. Oxygen saturation of >91% on room air ii. No or mild dyspnea (≤Grade 1)\n* Must have a leukapheresis material of non-mobilized cells accepted for manufacturing.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have maximum age of 25 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Prior gene therapy or engineered T cell therapy.\n* Prior treatment with any anti-CD19 therapy.\n* Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) <3 months prior to screening and ≤4 months prior to infusion.\n* Presence of grade 2 to 4 acute or extensive chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in patients who received prior allogeneic HSCT.\n* Prior diagnosis of malignancy other than study indication, and not disease free for 5 years.\n* Clinically significant active infection confirmed by clinical evidence, imaging, or positive laboratory tests (e.g., blood cultures, PCR for DNA/RNA, etc.)\n* Presence of active hepatitis B or C as indicated by serology.\n* Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) positive test.\n* Active neurological autoimmune or inflammatory disorders not related to B cell NHL (eg: Guillain-Barre syndrome, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis)\n* Active central nervous system (CNS) involvement by malignancy.\n* Patients with B-cell NHL in the context of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) associated lymphomas.",
