    "official_title": "A Phase I Study of Dose-Adjusted Etoposide, Prednisone, Vincristine, Cyclophosphamide, and Doxorubicin Plus Escalating Doses of Inotuzumab Ozogamicin (DA-EPOCH-InO) in Relapsed or Refractory B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Patients must have a confirmed diagnosis of CD22-positive, Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive or Ph-negative B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia or lymphoblastic lymphoma. CD22 expression will be determined by multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) or immunohistochemistry.\n* Relapsed or refractory disease, as defined by any of the following:\n\n  * Unable to achieve complete response (CR) despite >= 4 weeks of initial course of systemic therapy.\n  * Recurrence of disease at any point after CR was achieved.\n\n    * (Note: patients with Ph-positive disease must have received >= 1 second- or third-generation ABL kinase inhibitor as part of their prior treatment to be eligible.)\n* Detectable disease, as defined by any of the following:\n\n  * Presence of >= 5% abnormal blasts in the bone marrow or peripheral blood by morphology or MFC.\n  * Patients with isolated extramedullary disease will be permitted if there is >= 1 site of disease that measures >= 1.5 cm in longest diameter on cross-sectional imaging.\n* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >= 1,000/uL.\n* Hemoglobin >= 8 g/dL.\n* Platelets >= 50,000/uL.\n* Note: Transfusions and growth factor support will be permitted within 3 days of initiation of study treatment to reach these thresholds. As patients with relapsed/refractory ALL frequently have cytopenias due to marrow infiltration by the disease, no hematologic parameters will be required for enrollment if cytopenias can be attributed to disease.\n* Total serum bilirubin =< 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN); (unless due to Gilbert syndrome or hemolysis; =< 2 x ULN for hepatic abnormalities considered disease-related).\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) =< 2.5 x ULN.\n* Serum creatinine =< 1.5 x ULN or serum creatinine level associated with a measured or calculated creatinine clearance of >= 40 mL/min.\n* Corrected QT (QTc) interval =< 500 msec; if assessed, left ventricular ejection fraction >= 40%.\n* An Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 2.\n* Must agree to the use of effective contraception while on study treatment, unless they are highly unlikely to conceive (defined as [1] surgically sterilized, or [2] women who are and men whose sexual partner[s] is/are postmenopausal [i.e., a woman who is > 50 years old or who has not had menses for >= 1 year], or [3] not heterosexually active for the duration of the study).\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Patients with a circulating blast count of > 50,000/uL; systemic therapy with either hydroxyurea, vincristine, and/or corticosteroids will be permitted within 3 days of initiation of study treatment to reduce the blast count.\n* Except for management of circulating blasts noted above, adequate duration from prior therapy must be achieved before initiation of study treatment, as defined below:\n\n  * No cytotoxic or targeted systemic therapy < 2 weeks or 5 half-lives (whichever is shorter).\n  * No blinatumomab < 2 weeks.\n  * No radiation therapy < 4 weeks.\n  * No monoclonal antibody therapy < 6 weeks (except for prior InO, as discussed below).\n* Patients previously treated with InO will be eligible, unless they meet ANY of the following criteria:\n\n  * > 6 individual doses (e.g., > 2 standard cycles) were administered.\n  * Any documented hepatic toxicity observed was grade 3 or higher.\n  * The most recent dose was administered < 3 months from the initiation of study treatment.\n* For patients that have received prior allogeneic HCT, they must be >= 4 months from the date of stem cell infusion, with no prior history of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome/veno-occlusive disease (SOS/VOD), and off all treatment for graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) for >= 2 weeks. Patients with minimal active symptoms that can be controlled with topical therapies and/or the equivalent of prednisone =< 10 mg/day will be eligible.\n* For patients that have received other forms of cellular immunotherapy (e.g., chimeric antigen receptor-modified [CAR] T cells), they must be >= 21 days from cell infusion, and any specific manifestations of cytokine release syndrome or neurologic toxicity attributable to the cellular therapy have completely resolved (i.e., < grade 1)\n* Patients with a known history of chronic liver disease, including but not limited to cirrhosis, steatohepatitis, and chronic viral hepatitis. Patients with a history of GVHD of the liver will be permitted, provided they meet all of the other eligibility criteria.\n* Patients with isolated testicular or central nervous system disease.\n* Known hypersensitivity or intolerance to any of the agents under investigation.\n* May not be pregnant or nursing.",
