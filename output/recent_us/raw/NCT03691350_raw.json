>= 150 days after TBI, craniospinal XRT or if radiation to >= 50% of the pelvis; >= 42 days if other substantial bone marrow (BM) radiation\n  * Radiopharmaceutical therapy (e.g., radiolabeled antibody, 131 iodine metaiodobenzylguanidine [131I-MIBG]): >= 42 days must have elapsed since systemically administered radiopharmaceutical therapy\n  * Patients must not have received prior exposure to LY2606368\n* For patients with solid tumors without known bone marrow involvement:\n\n  * Peripheral absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >= 1000/mm^3\n  * Platelet count >= 75,000/mm^3 (transfusion independent, defined as not receiving platelet transfusions for at least 7 days prior to enrollment)\n  * Hemoglobin >= 8.0 g/dl at baseline (may receive packed red blood cell [PRBC] transfusions)\n* Patients with known bone marrow metastatic disease will be eligible for study provided they meet the blood counts (may receive transfusions provided they are not known to be refractory to red cell or platelet transfusions); these patients will not be evaluable for hematologic toxicity; at least 5 of every cohort of 6 patients must be evaluable for hematologic toxicity for the dose-escalation part of the study; if dose-limiting hematologic toxicity is observed, all subsequent patients enrolled must be evaluable for hematologic toxicity\n* Creatinine clearance or radioisotope glomerular filtration rate (GFR) >= 70ml/min/1.73 m^2 or a serum creatinine based on age/gender as follows:\n\n  * Age: maximum serum creatinine (mg/dL)\n  * 1 to < 2 years: 0.6 (male and female)\n  * 2 to < 6 years: 0.8 (male and female)\n  * 6 to < 10 years: 1 (male and female)\n  * 10 to < 13 years: 1.2 (male and female)\n  * 13 to < 16 years: 1.5 (male), 1.4 (female)\n  * >= 16 years: 1.7 (male), 1.4 (female)\n* Bilirubin (sum of conjugated + unconjugated) =< 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) for age\n* Serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) (alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) =< 135 U/L (3x ULN);

If possible, alternative agents should be considered\n  * Patients who are receiving drugs that prolong the QTc are eligible if the drug is necessary and no alternatives are available\n* Patients with seizure disorder may be enrolled if on anticonvulsants and well controlled\n* Nervous system disorders (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] version [v]4) resulting from prior therapy must be =< grade 2\n* For patients with CNS tumors, any baseline neurologic deficit, including seizures, must be stable for at least one week prior to initiating study treatment\n* All patients and/or their parents or legally authorized representatives must sign a written informed consent; assent, when appropriate, will be obtained according to institutional guidelines\n* Tissue blocks or slides must be sent if available; if tissue blocks or slides are unavailable, the study chair must be notified prior to study enrollment\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 12 Months\nMust have maximum age of 21 Years",
