    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Men and women ≥ 18 years of age on the day of signing the informed consent form (or the legal age of consent in the jurisdiction in which the study is taking place).\n2. Patients must have histologic confirmation of large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) classification. All LBCL subtypes are acceptable. Note: Patients with prior treatment for indolent lymphoma are still eligible for participation as long as they did not receive anthracycline-based therapy.\n3. Baseline 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography scan/computed tomography (PET/CT) must demonstrate FDG avid lesions compatible with CT-defined anatomical tumor sites (Note: FDG-PET/CT is not mandatory, and patients with CT scans only will be eligible for study entry as well). Patients should have at least 1 measurable site of disease per Lugano classification in FDG-PET/CT or CT scans.\n4. Presence of systemic and CNS involvement (brain, cerebellum, brainstem, meninges, cranial nerves, eyes, spinal cord, or a combination of these) at presentation.\n5. Determination of CNS involvement can be by brain biopsy, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) evaluation by cytology and/or flow cytometry, neuroimaging, or strong clinical suspicion by Investigator for which CNS targeted therapy is recommended (ie, numb chin syndrome in patients with high CNS involvement risk).\n6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) ≤ 2, except due to lymphoma involvement.\n7. Life expectancy of greater than ≥ 3 months.\n8. Women should avoid becoming pregnant while taking zanubrutinib and for up to 90 days after ending treatment. Therefore, women of childbearing potential must use highly effective contraceptive measures while taking zanubrutininb and for up to 90 days after stopping treatment. It is currently unknown whether zanubrutinib may reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives, and therefore women using hormonal contraceptives should add a barrier method. Pregnancy testing is recommended for women of reproductive potential prior to initiating therapy.\n\n   Agreement to use contraception during study participation.\n   1. Female patients of childbearing potential must use highly effective methods of contraception. Recommended acceptable contraception methods are included in Section 5.12.\n   2. Patients using hormonal contraceptives (eg, birth control pills or devices) must use a barrier method of contraception (eg, condoms) as well.\n   3. A woman is considered of childbearing potential, ie, fertile, following menarche and until becoming postmenopausal unless permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy.\n   4. A post-menopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause.\n9. Male patients with a female partner of childbearing potential are eligible if they abstained, are vasectomized or if they agree to the use of barrier contraception with other methods described above during the study treatment period and for 90 days after the last dose of zanubrutinib.\n10. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:\n\n    1. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) > 1,000 cells/mm3 independent of growth factor support within 7 days of study entry (≥ 750 cells/mm3 if lymphoma involvement of the bone marrow or spleen).\n    2. Platelets ≥ 75,000 platelets/mm3 independent of transfusion support within 7 days of study entry (≥ 50,000/mm3 independent of transfusion support within 7 days of study entry if lymphoma involvement of the bone marrow or spleen).\n    3. Hemoglobin > 9 g/dL or > 8 g/dL in case of bone marrow involvement by lymphoma independent of transfusion support within 7 days of study entry.\n    4. Serum total bilirubin ≤ 2 x upper limit of normal (ULN; except patients with Gilberts syndrome).\n    5. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST; serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT)) and alanine transaminase (ALT); serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT)) ≤2.5 x institutional ULN (≤3x institutional ULN if lymphoma involvement of the liver).\n    6. Creatinine within normal institutional limits, or creatinine clearance ≥ 40 mL/min (as estimated by the Cockcroft-Gault equation or alternative formula according to institutional guidelines) for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal.\n11. Able to provide written informed consent and can understand and agree to comply with the requirements of the study and the schedule of assessments (SoA).\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Primary CNS lymphoma without evidence of systemic lymphoma.\n2. Prior systemic lymphoma therapy (Note: 1 cycle of an anthracycline based regimen, such as rituximab, cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, oncovin, and prednisone (R-CHOP), polatuzumab vedotin, rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone (pola-R-CHP), dose-adjusted etoposide phosphate, prednisone, oncovin, cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, and rituximab (EPOCH-R), or rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and methotrexate (R-Codox-M), and/or 1 dose of intrathecal therapy, will be allowed before enrollment [Section 5.9]).

Patients with presence of HBcAb, but absence of HBsAg, are eligible if hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA is undetectable (< 20 IU), and if they are willing to undergo monitoring every 4 weeks for HBV reactivation.\n    3.
