Sperm donation is prohibited during the study and for 6 months after the last dose of the assigned study treatment. Highly effective contraceptive measures include:\n\n  * Stable use of combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception (oral, intravaginal, transdermal) or progestogen-only hormonal contraception (oral, injectable, implantable) associated with inhibition of ovulation initiated ≥ 2 menstrual cycles prior to screening\n  * Intrauterine device (IUD); intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS)\n  * Bilateral tubal ligation/occlusion\n  * Vasectomized partner (provided that the male vasectomized partner is the sole sexual partner of the study patient and that the partner has obtained medical assessment of surgical success for the procedure)\n  * Sexual abstinence, only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study drugs\n  * Childbearing potential defined as not being surgically sterilized (men and women) or have not been free from menses for > 1 year (women only)\n  * A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient to determine the occurrence of a postmenopausal state. The above definitions are according to the clinical trial facilitation group guidance. Pregnancy testing and contraception are not required\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
