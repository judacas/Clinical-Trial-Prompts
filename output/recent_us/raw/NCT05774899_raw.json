    "official_title": "Metformin for Older Patients With Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) will be defined in accord with the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association 2013 guidelines statement on Management of heart failure and as previously described. The 4 key inclusion criteria for HFpEF include: 1) clinical signs and symptoms as scored by National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)-HF Clinical Score ≥3 and the Rich Criteria; 2) a normal left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (≥50%) by echocardiography; 3) LV diastolic dysfunction > grade 1 (American Society of Echocardiography Recommendations); 4) no evidence of significant ischemic, valvular, pulmonary or other medical disorder to account for their symptoms.\n* Age ≥60\n* Stable HF symptoms and medications for ≥3 weeks\n* Final eligibility will be based upon all information available at the conclusion of the baseline visits tests, including review of hospital and outpatient records, history, physical examination, echocardiogram, and familiarization/screening exercise test by a board-certified investigator cardiologist who have extensive experience in heart failure investigations in older persons with HFpEF\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 60 Years",
