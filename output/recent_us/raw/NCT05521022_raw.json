If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required.\n* Female participants of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate methods of contraception starting with the first dose of study therapy through 60 days after the last dose of study therapy.\n\n  * Participants of childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not been free from menses for > 1 year without an alternative medical cause.\n  * Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the preferred contraception for the participant.\n* Male participants must agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting with the first dose of study therapy through 60 days after the last dose of study therapy.\n\n  * Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the preferred contraception for the participant.\n* Participants must not have received live vaccines within 30 days prior to trial registration. Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, shingles, yellow fever, rabies, bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), and typhoid (oral) vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist) are live attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.\n* Participants must not have known active hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection prior to trial registration. Patients who have completed curative therapy for HCV are eligible. Patients with known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are eligible if they meet each of the following 3 criteria:\n\n  * CD4 counts >= 350 mm^3\n  * Serum HIV viral load of < 25,000 IU/ml and\n  * Treated on a stable antiretroviral regimen.\n* No other prior invasive malignancy is allowed except for the following: adequately treated basal (or squamous cell) skin cancer, in situ breast or cervical cancer.
