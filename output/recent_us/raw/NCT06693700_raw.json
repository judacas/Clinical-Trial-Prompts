    "official_title": "Dose-Adjusted Etoposide, Prednisone, Vincristine, Cyclophosphamide, and Doxorubicin (DA-EPOCH) +/- Rituximab (R) + Tafasitamab-cxix for the Treatment of Newly-Diagnosed Adults With Philadelphia Chromosome-Negative (Ph-) B-cell Lymphoblastic Lymphoma/Leukemia (B-ALL)",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Adults (age 18 years and older) with newly-diagnosed CD19+ Ph- B-ALL\n* In the opinion of the treating investigator, patients must be an unsuitable candidate for a pediatric-inspired regimen, reasons for which may include (but not be limited to) older age (e.g., >= 40 years), practical/logistical barriers to or toxicity concerns from administration of a pediatric-inspired regimen\n* Marrow or blood involvement detectable by MFC\n* Total bilirubin =< 2.0 x upper limit of normal (ULN) (unless attributed to Gilbert's disease or other causes of inherited indirect hyperbilirubinemia, at which point total bilirubin must be =< 4.0 x ULN)\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT]) =< 5.0 x institutional ULN. (Note: Patients with liver test abnormalities attributable to hepatic involvement by ALL will be permitted if the total bilirubin is =< 5.0 x ULN and ALT/AST are =< 8.0 x ULN)\n* Calculated creatinine clearance of > 30 ml/min, as measured by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation, will be eligible\n* As patients with ALL frequently have cytopenias, no hematologic parameters will be required for enrollment or to receive the first cycle of treatment. However, adequate recovery of blood counts will be required to receive subsequent cycles\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 to 2. (Performance status of 3 will be allowed if poor performance status is thought to be directly secondary to ALL)\n* Ability to give informed consent and comply with the protocol\n* Anticipated survival of at least 3 months, independent of ALL\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia\n* No prior systemic therapy for ALL except to control acute symptoms and/or hyperleukocytosis (e.g., corticosteroids, cytarabine, etc.)\n* No isolated extramedullary or known parenchymal central nervous system (CNS) disease\n* Known hypersensitivity or intolerance to any of the agents under investigation\n* Other medical or psychiatric conditions that in the opinion of the investigator would preclude safe participation in the protocol\n* May not be pregnant or nursing\n\n  * Pregnancy test is only required in women, unless they are highly unlikely to conceive (defined as [1] surgically sterilized, or [2] postmenopausal [i.e., a woman who is > 50 years old or who has not had menses for >=1 year], or [3] not heterosexually active)",
