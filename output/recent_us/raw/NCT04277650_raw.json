    "inclusion_criteria": "* Patients aged 6 months to =< 65 years at time of consent.\n* Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML):\n\n  * Complete first remission (CR1), complete second remission (CR2) or greater (CR2+), must have < 5% marrow blasts at the time of transplant.\n  * Patients in morphologic remission with persistent cytogenetic, flow cytometric, or molecular aberrations are eligible.\n* Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL):\n\n  * Complete first remission (CR1) at high risk for relapse such as any of the following:\n\n    * Presence of any high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities such as t(9;22), t(1;19), t(4;11) or other MLL rearrangements (11q23) or other high-risk molecular abnormality.\n    * Failure to achieve MRD- complete remission after induction therapy.\n    * Persistence or recurrence of minimal residual disease on therapy.\n    * Any patient unable to tolerate consolidation and/or maintenance chemotherapy as would have been deemed appropriate by the treating physician.\n    * Other high-risk features not defined above.\n  * Complete second remission (CR2) or greater (CR2+).\n\n    * Note: ALL with less than 5% blasts at time of transplant but persistent cytogenetic, flow cytometric or molecular aberrations are eligible.\n* Other acute leukemias: Acute leukemias of ambiguous lineage or mixed phenotype with less than 5% blasts. Leukemias in morphologic remission with persistent cytogenetic, flow cytometric or molecular aberrations are eligible.\n* Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML): Excluding refractory blast crisis. To be eligible in first chronic phase (CP1) patient must have failed or be intolerant to tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy.\n* Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and myeloproliferative disorders (MPD) other than myelofibrosis:\n\n  * MDS/MPD overlap syndromes without myelofibrosis.\n  * MDS/ MPD patients must have less than 10% bone marrow myeloblasts and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) > 0.2 (growth factor supported if necessary) at transplant work-up.\n* Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) at high-risk of relapse or progression if not in remission:\n\n  * Eligible patients with aggressive histology (such as, but not limited to, diffuse large B-cell NHL, mantle cell NHL, and T-cell histology) in CR by PET/CT imaging.\n  * Eligible patients with indolent B-cell NHL (such as, but not limited to, follicular, small cell or marginal zone NHL) will have 2nd or subsequent progression with PR or CR by PET/CT imaging.\n* Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) in morphologic remission.\n* Only for adult patients, to prevent graft rejection, patients who received only non-lymphodepleting agents for their malignancy (hypomethylating agents, venetoclax, hydroxyurea, TKIs etc.), or patients who received lymphodepleting chemotherapy > 3 months prior to scheduled admission, may receive fludarabine 25 mg/m^2 daily x 3 days for lymphodepletion 14-42 days (aiming for 2-4 weeks) at the discretion of the principal investigator (PI).\n* For patients > 18 years old, Karnofsky score ≥ 70%. For patients =< 18 years old, Lansky score ≥ 50%.\n* Calculated creatinine clearance > 70 ml/min.\n* Bilirubin < 1.5 mg/dL (unless benign congenital hyperbilirubinemia or hemolysis).\n* Alanine transaminase (ALT) < 3 x upper limit of normal (ULN).\n* For patients > 18 years old, pulmonary function (spirometry and corrected diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide [DLCO]) > 60% predicted. For patients =< 18 years old, or any patient unable to perform pulmonary function tests, O2 saturation > 92% on room air.\n* Left ventricular ejection fraction > 50%.\n* Albumin > 3.0 g/dL.\n* For patients > 18 years old, Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Comorbidity index (HCT-CI) =< 5.\n* UCB units will be selected according to current umbilical cord blood graft selection algorithm. One or two UCB units may be used to achieve the required cell dose.\n* The UCB graft is matched at 4-6 HLA-A, B, DRB1 antigens with the recipient. This may include 0-2 antigen mismatches at the A or B or DRB1 loci. Unit selection based on cryopreserved nucleated cell dose and HLA-A, B, DRB1 using intermediate resolution A, B antigen and DRB1 allele typing.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 6 Months\nMust have maximum age of 65 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Diagnosis of myelofibrosis or other malignancy with moderate-severe bone marrow fibrosis.\n* Patients persistent with central nervous system (CNS) involvement in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or CNS imaging at time of screening0\n* Prior checkpoint inhibitors/ blockade in the last 12 months.\n* Two prior stem cell transplants of any kind.\n* One prior autologous stem cell transplant within the preceding 12 months.\n* Prior allogeneic transplantation.\n* Prior involved field radiation therapy that would preclude safe delivery of 400cGy total body irradiation (TBI) in the opinion of radiation oncology.\n* Active and uncontrolled infection at time of transplantation.\n* HIV infection.\n* Inadequate performance status/ organ function.\n* Pregnancy or breast feeding.\n* Patient or guardian unable to give informed consent or unable to comply with the treatment protocol including appropriate supportive care, long-term follow-up, and research tests.",
