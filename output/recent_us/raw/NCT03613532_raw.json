    "official_title": "A Multi-Centre Non-Inferiority Randomized Controlled Trial of STOPping Cardiac MEDications in Patients With Normalized Cancer Therapy Related Cardiac Dysfunction: The STOP-MED CTRCD Trial",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Adult patients (age ≥18 years) with cancer therapy completed more than 6 months prior (other than hormonal therapy) and no plan for further cancer treatments with potential risk for CTRCD.\n* Prior cancer therapy with anthracyclines and/ or HER2-targeted therapy.\n* Prior asymptomatic, moderate CTRCD, defined using the European Society of Cardiology criteria (≥10% drop in LVEF from baseline to 40% to 49.9% OR <10% drop to 40-49.9% with a reduction in GLS by >15% or new abnormal Troponin I/T or NT-proBNP), diagnosed within 1 year of completing potentially cardiotoxic cancer therapy.\n* Current use of ≥1 HF medication started for CTRCD for at least 6 months with LVEF ≥55% by recently performed (≤6 months) echocardiogram, normal NT-proBNP, and no symptoms attributable to HF.\n* Confirmation of LVEF ≥55% and normal volumes at baseline CMR (i.e., some patients recruited based on echocardiography, may be excluded if baseline CMR LVEF/volumes are not normal). This is included given that the primary outcome includes the use of CMR LVEF.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Indication for continuation of HF medications i.e., ongoing HF symptoms, chronic kidney disease (CKD), vascular disease, atrial or ventricular arrythmias, other (note: participants with hypertension will be switched to other guideline-based antihypertensive therapy).\n* Contraindications for CMR (e.g., MRI non-compatible implanted pacemakers).\n* Patients with severe CTRCD defined as having a nadir LVEF <40% due to the known poor prognosis in these patients.\n* Continued use of loop diuretic therapy for heart failure purposes i.e., furosemide.\n* Life expectancy <1 year or metastatic disease.\n* Prior history of major cardiovascular event (defined as myocardial infarction, cerebral vascular event, admission for HF) or therapeutic cardiovascular procedure (e.g., percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)).\n* Issues that prevent communication, understanding or presentation for study-related visits and inability to provide informed consent.",
