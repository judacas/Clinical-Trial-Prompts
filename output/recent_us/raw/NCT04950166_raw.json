As a guidance to the site investigators, tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area are considered measurable if progression has been demonstrated in such lesions.\n5. Subject has adequate organ function defined by the following parameters (all specimens must be collected within 15 days prior to randomization):\n\n   * Hematological: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1500/μL, Platelets ≥100,000/μL; Hemoglobin ≥9.0 g/dL or ≥5.6 mmol/L;\n   * Renal: Estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥30 mL/min using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation.\n   * Hepatic: Total bilirubin ≤1.5 × ULN or direct bilirubin ≤ULN for subjects with total bilirubin levels >1.5 × ULN, Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤2.5 ULN (if approved by Medical Monitor, ≤5 × ULN for subjects with liver metastases; AST and ALT >5 to 20 x ULN may be included if asymptomatic).\n   * Coagulation: INR, prothrombin time (PT) ≤1.5 × ULN; if subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy, INR or PT- should be within therapeutic range of anticoagulant.\n6. For female subjects defined as women of childbearing potential (WOCBP), a negative urine pregnancy test must be obtained during screening. If the urine test cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required. Women who are surgically sterile or at least 2 years postmenopausal do not require pregnancy testing.\n7. Male subjects of childbearing potential must agree to use a condom as an effective method of contraception starting with the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy.\n8.

Has an active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e., with use of disease modifying agents or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency) is not considered systemic treatment and is allowed.\n15.

Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the subject's participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.\n21. Has a known psychiatric or substance abuse disorder that would interfere with the subject's ability to cooperate with the requirements of the study.\n22.
