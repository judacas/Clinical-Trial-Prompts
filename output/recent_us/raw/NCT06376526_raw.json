Documented history of uncontrolled diabetes (i.e., symptomatic hyperglycemia that cannot be medically managed, fasting blood glucose level above 300 mg/dL, and/or frequent swings between hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia)\n9. Currently enrolled in another investigational drug or device trial that clinically interferes with this study.\n10. Unable to comply with the study requirements or follow-up schedule.\n11. Any condition or comorbidity that the Investigator believes would interfere with the intent of the study or would make participation not in the best interest of the subject.\n12.
