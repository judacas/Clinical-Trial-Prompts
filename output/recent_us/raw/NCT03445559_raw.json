    "inclusion_criteria": "* At least 18 years old\n* Presence of hematologic malignancy or Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation\n* Identification of Pseudomonas aeruginosa by rapid molecular diagnostic assay from a blood culture or from a respiratory sample in the setting of radiologically documented pneumonia and clinical symptoms compatible with pneumonia.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Anaphylactic hypersensitivity or allergic reaction to cephalosporins\n* Participants with expected mortality within 48 hours\n* Hemodialysis or continuous renal replacement therapy, or creatinine clearance <15 ml/min\n* Prior non-study anti-pseudomonal therapy for >72 hours\n* History of a strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa with MIC >4 microgram/ml to ceftolozane/tazobactam\n* Polymicrobial aerobic Gram-negative infection as determined by ID research team\n\nPatients who completed this study and subsequently experience a separate, recurrent Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, may be re-enrolled into this study if all eligibility criteria are met.",
