LL in second or greater relapse or refractory to 2 prior induction regimens and biopsy proven and with evidence of measurable disease by radiologic criteria and aged 1 to 30 years.\n  2. T-cell cohort: Stage 1; ALL in first relapse or refractory to 1 prior induction/consolidation regimen with (>=) 5% blasts in the bone marrow and aged 1 to <18 years. Stage 2; ALL in first relapse or refractory to 1 prior induction/consolidation regimen with (>=) 5% blasts in the bone marrow and aged 1 to 30 years. LL in first relapse or refractory to 1 prior induction/consolidation regimen biopsy proven and with evidence of measurable disease by radiologic criteria and aged 1 to 30 years\n* Performance status greater than or equal to (>=) 70 by Lansky scale (for participants less than [<] 16 years of age) or Karnofsky scale (for participants [>=] 16 years of age)\n* Adequate hematology laboratory values at Cycle 1 Day 1 pre-dosing defined as follows:\n\n  1. Hemoglobin (>=) 7.5 gram per deciliter (g/dL) ([>=] 5 millimole per liter [mmol/L]; prior red blood cell [RBC] transfusion is permitted)\n  2. Platelet count (>=) 10*10^9 per liter (L) (prior platelet transfusion is permitted)\n* Adequate renal function defined as normal serum creatinine for the participant's age or creatinine clearance or radioisotope glomerular filtration rate (GFR) >= 70 milliliter per minute per 1.73 square meter (mL/min/1.73 m^2) prior to enrollment\n* Adequate liver function prior to enrollment defined as:\n\n  1. Alanine aminotransferase level less than or equal to (<=) 2.5* the upper limit of normal (ULN),\n  2. Aspartate aminotransferase level (<=) 2.5* ULN, and\n  3. Total bilirubin (<=) 2* ULN or direct bilirubin level (<=) 2.0* ULN\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 1 Year\nMust have maximum age of 30 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Received an allogeneic hematopoietic transplant within 3 months of screening\n* Active acute graft-versus-host disease of any grade or chronic graft-versus-host disease of Grade 2 or higher\n* Received immunosuppression post hematopoietic transplant within 1 month of study entry\n* Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) B-cell ALL eligible for tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy\n* Has either of the following:\n\n  1. Evidence of dyspnea at rest or oxygen saturation (<=) 94 percent (%).\n  2. Known moderate or severe persistent asthma within the past 2 years, or uncontrolled asthma of any classification\n* Received an investigational drug, was vaccinated with live attenuated vaccines, or used an invasive investigational medical device within 4 weeks before the planned first dose of study drug, or is currently being treated in an investigational study\n* Known to be seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\n* Any one of the following:\n\n  1. Seropositive for hepatitis B (defined by a positive test for hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]). Participants with resolved infection (ie, participants who are HBsAg negative but positive for antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen [anti-HBc] and/or antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen [anti-HBs]) must be screened using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) measurement of hepatitis B virus (HBV) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) levels. Those who are PCR positive will be excluded\n  2. Known to be seropositive for hepatitis C (except in the setting of a sustained virologic response [SVR], defined as aviremia at least 12 weeks after completion of antiviral therapy)",
