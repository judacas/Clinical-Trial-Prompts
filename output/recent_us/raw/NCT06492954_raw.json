    "inclusion_criteria": "* Confirmed diagnosis of one of the following:\n\nNHL Cohorts:\n\n1. MZL i. R/R extranodal, splenic, or nodal MZL defined as disease that relapsed after, or was refractory to, at least one prior therapy ii. Active disease requiring treatment\n2. FL i. R/R FL (Grade 1, 2 or 3a based on the WHO 2008 classification of tumors of hematopoietic and lymphoid tissue) and defined as disease that relapsed after, or was refractory to, at least 1 prior systemic therapy\n3. DLBCL i. R/R DLBCL (including all subtypes of DLBCL) defined as disease that relapsed after, or was refractory to, at least two prior systemic therapies and has either progressed following or is not a candidate for autologous stem cell transplant (due to comorbidities or non-responsiveness to salvage chemotherapy)\n4. Transformed indolent B-cell NHL i. Any lymphoma otherwise eligible for Part 1 that has transformed into a more aggressive lymphoma. Patients with transformation from CLL or SLL (Richter's transformation) are not eligible for Part 1\n\n   CLL/SLL Cohorts:\n5. CLL/SLL diagnosis that meets the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL) criteria i. Disease characterized as Treatment Naive (TN) or R/R disease defined as disease that relapsed after, or was refractory to, at least 1 prior therapy ii. Requiring treatment as defined by history\n\n   MCL cohorts:\n6. WHO-defined MCL i. R/R MCL defined as disease that relapsed after, or was refractory to, at least 1 prior systemic therapy; ii. Requiring treatment in the opinion of the investigator\n\nWM cohorts:\n\ng. WHO-defined WM (clinical and definitive histologic diagnosis) i. R/R disease defined as disease that relapsed after, or was refractory to, at least 1 prior therapy; ii. Meeting at least 1 criterion for treatment according to consensus panel criteria from the Seventh International Workshop on Waldenström's Macroglobulinemia (Dimopoulos et al 2014)\n\n* Measurable disease by computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), defined as:\n\n  1. CLL: at least 1 lymph node > 1.5 cm in longest diameter and measurable in 2 perpendicular dimensions or clonal lymphocytes measured by flow cytometry\n  2. DLBCL, FL, MZL, MCL, or SLL: at least 1 lymph node > 1.5 cm in longest diameter OR 1 extranodal lesion > 1.0 cm in the longest diameter, measurable in at least 2 perpendicular dimensions. For MZL, isolated splenomegaly is considered measurable for this study\n  3. WM: serum immunoglobulin (Ig) M level > 0.5 g/dL\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 2\n* Adequate organ function\n* Adequate pancreatic function indicated by:\n\n  1. Serum amylase ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN)\n  2. Serum lipase ≤ 1.5 x ULN\n\nKey\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Known current central nervous system involvement by lymphoma/leukemia\n* Known plasma cell neoplasm, prolymphocytic leukemia, history of or currently suspected Richter's syndrome\n* Prior therapy ≥ 2 months with or progression on a B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) inhibitor\n\nNOTE: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.",
