    "inclusion_criteria": "* Participants is ≥ 18 years of age at the time of signing the Informed Consent Form (ICF).\n* Participants must understand and voluntarily sign an ICF prior to any study-related assessments/procedures being conducted.\n* Participants are willing and able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements.\n* Participants with histologically or cytologically confirmed AML including de novo AML or secondary AML transformed from MDS according to 2022 World Health Organization (WHO) criteria classification, or with histologically or cytologically confirmed HR-MDS.\n* R/R AML and R/R HR-MDS who have failed or are ineligible for all available therapies which may provide clinical benefit.\n* Participants must have the following screening laboratory values:\n\n  * Total white blood cell count (WBC) < 25 x 10^9/L prior to the first dose of the study drug.\n  * Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 3.0 × upper limit of normal (ULN), unless considered due to extensive leukemic liver involvement, in which case AST and ALT can be ≤ 5.0 x ULN.\n  * Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN, unless considered due to Gilbert's syndrome, in which case serum total bilirubin < 3 x ULN.\n  * Estimated serum creatinine clearance of ≥ 60 mL/min using the Cockcroft-Gault equation.
