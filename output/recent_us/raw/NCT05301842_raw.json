Diagnosis of a current or prior invasive malignancy (except non-melanoma skin cancer) unless the participant has been disease free for at least 3 years.\n6. Participant is a prisoner\n7.

The need to exclude patients with AIDS from this protocol is necessary because the treatments involved in this protocol may be slightly immunosuppressive. Protocol-specific requirements may also exclude immuno-compromised patients.\n10.
