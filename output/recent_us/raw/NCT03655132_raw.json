    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Be willing and able to provide written informed consent/assent for the trial.\n2. Be >=18 years of age on day of signing informed consent.\n3. Have a performance status of 0 or 1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Scale.\n4. Histologically documented adenocarcinoma of the prostate\n5. Oligometastatic disease. In order to be eligible, the patient must have a total of <4 metastatic bone and/or metastatic lymph node sites based on bone and/or soft tissue lesions as defined by any of the following:\n\n   1. Bone metastases will be defined by bone imaging. If the patient has technetium bone scan, and/or sodium fluoride (NaF) PET performed, either study may be used for documenting metastases; both scans do not need to show the number of metastases required for study entry. For patients undergoing PSMA PET, only PSMA avid lesions that are consistent with metastasis will be counted as a site of metastasis.\n   2. Distant metastatic lymph node disease. A lymph node ≥1 cm in shortest dimension will be noted as involved with disease. Distant metastatic lymph nodes will be determined as any lymph nodes outside the confines of the true pelvis. For patients undergoing PSMA PET, only PSMA avid lesions that are consistent with metastasis will be counted as a site of metastasis.\n   3. Any other soft tissue lesion deemed by the physician to be consistent with distant metastatic disease. For patients undergoing PSMA PET, only PSMA avid lesions that have a CT or MRI correlate consistent with metastasis will be counted as a site of metastasis.\n\n      * Note: Radiographic imaging performed as standard of care prior to obtaining informed consent and within 60 days of initiating study treatment may be used to assess oligometastatic disease during screening, rather than repeating scans. For patients who have started on ADT, they must have had imaging prior to initiation of hormonal therapy\n6. Treatment naïve, defined as less than 2 months of standard of care ADT (e.g. GnRH agonist or antagonist with or without antiandrogen, including abiraterone) for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer prior to enrollment (at the time of consent)\n7. No prior chemotherapy for prostate cancer\n8. Not a candidate for or refuse chemotherapy\n9. No prior prostatectomy or prostatic radiation\n10. PSA >2 ng/mL at baseline or prior to initiation of hormonal therapy\n11. Baseline testosterone >150 ng/dL if patient has not initiated hormonal therapy, for those patients who have already initiated hormonal therapy, baseline testosterone is not required\n12. Consent to undergo mandatory prostatic core biopsies at the time of fiducial marker placement and 1-3 weeks after Cycle 1 Day 1 of pembrolizumab.\n13. The effects of pembrolizumab on the developing human fetus is unknown. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must agree to use adequate contraception prior to the first dose of study therapy, for the duration of the study participation, and for 120 days after the last dose of study therapy. Their partners should also be encouraged to use proper method of contraception. Their partners should also be encouraged to use proper method of contraception.\n14. Demonstrate adequate organ function defined as: Adequate Organ Function Laboratory Values (Performed within 10 days of treatment initiation):\n\n    * Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1,500 /microliter (mcL)\n    * Platelets >=100,000 / mcL\n    * Hemoglobin >=9 g/dL or ≥5.6 mmol/L without transfusion or erythropoietin (EPO) dependency (within 7 days of assessment)\n    * Serum creatinine OR Measured or calculated creatinine clearance (GFR can also be used in place of creatinine or CrCl) <=1.5 X upper limit of normal (ULN) OR ≥60 mL/min for subject with creatinine levels > 1.5 X institutional ULN. Creatinine clearance should be calculated per institutional standard\n    * Serum total bilirubin <= 1.5 X ULN OR Direct bilirubin <= ULN for subjects with total bilirubin levels > 1.5 ULN\n    * Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (SGOT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 X ULN OR ≤ 5 X ULN for subjects with liver metastases\n    * Albumin >2.5 mg/dL\n    * International Normalized Ratio (INR) or Prothrombin Time (PT)\n    * Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) ≤1.5 X ULN unless subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants ≤1.5 X ULN unless subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants\n    * Creatinine clearance should be calculated per institutional standard.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Patients who are not appropriate candidates for prostate or oligometastasis-directed SBRT\n2. Patients with neuroendocrine or small cell features are not eligible.\n3. Patients with evidence of liver metastasis are excluded.\n4. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists or GnRH antagonists (e.g., leuprorelin, degarelix) for > 2 months prior to consenting\n5. Antiandrogens (e.g., bicalutamide, flutamide, nilutamide, abiraterone, enzalutamide) for > 2 months prior to consenting. Patients on 5-alpha reductase inhibitors are allowed on study.\n6. Estrogen containing compounds for > 2 months prior to consenting\n7. PC-SPES or PC-x products. Other herbal therapies or supplements will be considered by the Principle Investigator on a case-by-case basis based on their potential for hormonal or anti-cancer therapies.\n8.

Exceptions include carcinoid, basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical cancer.\n18.

This exception does not include carcinomatous meningitis which is excluded regardless of clinical stability.\n19.
