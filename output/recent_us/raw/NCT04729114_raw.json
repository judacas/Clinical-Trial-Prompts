    "official_title": "A Phase I, Open-label, Parallel Group Study to Investigate Olaparib Safety and Tolerability, Efficacy and Pharmacokinetics in Paediatric Patients With Solid Tumours",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Provision of Informed Consent\n* Male and female patients who are ≥6 months to <18 years of age at consent\n* Pathologically confirmed relapsed or refractory solid or primary CNS tumours (excluding lymphoid malignancies), with a HRR deficiency/gene mutation, and for whom there are no standard treatment options. Eligible patients may include but not be limited to those with osteosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, non rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma, Ewing Sarcoma, neuroblastoma, medulloblastoma and glioma\n* For dose finding phase only: recruitment will be open to all patients with HRR deficiency, based on a local test. For the signal identification phase: recruitment will be open only to patients with documented evidence of a deleterious or suspected deleterious germline or tumour HRR gene mutation that meets the AZ HRR rules\n* A formalin fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumour sample from the primary cancer (all patients) suitable for central HRR testing and a blood sample (patients ≥2 years old) for central germline BRCA testing must be provided for each patient\n* For all non-neuroblastoma tumours, patients must have at least 1 radiographical assessable lesion (measurable and/or non-measurable). For neuroblastoma tumours, patients must have radiographical assessable disease with at least 1 lesion (measurable and/or non measurable) OR disease evidenced by uptake of meta-iodobenzylguanidine- (MIBG) or fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scans\n* Adequate performance status, organ, and marrow function and adequate weight to obtain blood samples for both safety laboratory assessments and PK analysis.\n* Ability to swallow tablets\n\nKey\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 0 Years\nMust have maximum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Patients with MDS/AML or with features suggestive of MDS/AML\n* Patients unable to swallow orally administered medication\n* Unresolved toxicity from previous anticancer therapy\n* Unstable or untreated CNS disease (i.e., symptomatic uncontrolled brain metastases or untreated spinal cord compression)\n* Previous treatment with a PARP inhibitor, including olaparib\n* Receipt of any radiotherapy for cancer treatment (except for palliative reasons) within 30 days prior to first dose of study treatment or receipt of last dose of an approved (marketed) anticancer therapy (chemotherapy, targeted therapy, biologic therapy, monoclonal antibodies, etc) within 21 days prior to the first dose of study treatment\n* Concomitant use of known strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors or concomitant use of known strong or moderate CYP3A inducers\n* Whole blood transfusions in the last 120 days prior to screening (packed red blood cells and platelet transfusions are acceptable)",
