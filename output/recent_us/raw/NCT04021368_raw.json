    "official_title": "A Multi-center, Open-label, Single-arm Phase I Dose-escalation and Phase II Dose-expansion Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, PK Characteristics and Anti-tumor Activity of FCN-159 in Adult and Pediatric Participants With Neurofibromatosis Type 1",
    "inclusion_criteria": "General inclusion criteria for Phase I and II:\n\n1.Cohort 1: 16-70 years of age (inclusive) with a body weight of ≥ 94 lbs or 42.5 kg.\n\nCohort 2: 2-15 years of age (inclusive) and able to swallow whole tablet. 2.Participants must be diagnosed with NF1-related plexiform neurofibromas (PN) and symptomatic with requirement of systematic therapy per investigator's judgment. A PN is defined as a neurofibroma that has grown along the length of a nerve and may involve multiple fascicles and branches. A spinal PN involves two or more levels with connection between the levels or extending laterally along the nerve. Diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is based on meeting at least 1 of the following 2 diagnostic criteria:\n\n1. Genetic testing confirmation: i.e., positive for NF1 germline mutation per CLIA-certified laboratory (or equivalent) testing. Note: NF1 germline mutation positive must either be confirmed by the FCN-159-002 central laboratory or have documentation of NF1 mutation issued by a CLIA-certified laboratory (or equivalent) - OR -\n2. Clinical and imaging confirmation: Meets at least 2 of the following 7 NF1 diagnostic criteria according to the clinical NIH consensus criteria:\n\n   1. ≥ 6 cafe-au-lait macules (>0.5 cm in prepubertal participants and > 1.5 cm in post-pubertal participants);\n   2. Axillary freckling or freckling in inguinal regions;\n   3. ≥2 neurofibromas of any type, or ≥ 1 plexiform neurofibroma;\n   4. An optic pathway glioma;\n   5. ≥2 Lisch nodules (iris hamartomas);\n   6. A distinctive bony lesion such as dysplasia of the sphenoid bone or dysplasia or thinning of long bone cortex);\n   7. First-degree relative with NF1. 3. Participants should meet one of the following criteria\n\n   <!-- -->\n\n   1. Must be judged by the investigator to be inoperable for complete resection without causing substantial damage, or unsuitable for surgery with high surgical risks , e.g. due to encasement of or close proximity to vital structures, invasiveness, or high vascularity、Extensive lesion scope surgery is not feasible. NF1 has to cause or has the potential to cause significant morbidity, such as (but not limited to) head and neck lesions that could compromise the airway or great vessels, paraspinal lesions that can cause myelopathy, brachial or lumbar plexus lesions that could cause nerve compression and loss of function, lesions that could result in major deformity (e.g., orbital lesions) or are significantly disfiguring, lesions of the extremity that cause limb hypertrophy or loss of function, and painful lesions.\n   2. The participants who have previously received surgical treatment, if the PN resection is incomplete, the postoperative residual exceeds 15% of the primary lesion, or relapse after surgery, and the lesions of at least 3 cm are measured in one dimension, are eligible for enrollment. At least a 28-day interval is required between surgery and the first dose of FCN-159.\n\n      4. Participants must have a measurable lesion, defined as at least 3 cm in length in at least one dimension, amenable to MRI for efficacy assessment.\n\n      5. Adult participants: Karnofsky performance level of ≥70%; Pediatric participants: Lansky performance score ≥ 70%, see Appendix 18.\n\n      Note: Participants who are wheelchair bound because of paralysis secondary to a plexiform neurofibroma should be considered ambulatory when they are in the wheelchair. Similarly, participants with limited mobility secondary to the need for mechanical support (such as an airway PN requiring tracheostomy or CPAP) will also be considered ambulatory for the purposes of this study.\n\n      6. Coagulation function: International normalized ratio (INR) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) ≤ 1.5 ULN.\n\n      7. Participants or their legal guardians (if the participant is <18 years old) are able to understand and voluntarily sign a written informed consent form.\n\n      8. For participants of childbearing potential: participants must agree to take effective contraception, and receive double barrier contraception, condom, oral or injectable contraceptives, intrauterine device and other contraceptive methods during treatment and for at least 90 days after the last dose. Male participants must agree to avoid sperm donation for at least 90 days after the last dose.\n\n      9. Willing to avoid excessive sun exposure and use adequate amounts of sunscreen if sun exposure is anticipated.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 2 Years\nMust have maximum age of 70 Years",
