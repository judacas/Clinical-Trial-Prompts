    "official_title": "A Phase I Study of the Tolerability/Palatability of TalityTM Synthetic Meal Replacement in Patients With Prostate Cancer",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Biopsy-proven prostate cancer with stable or rising PSA levels, defined as three consecutive PSA levels, each value greater than 1 week apart, with fluctuation between the three values no more than 10% downward. The third PSA needs to be within 30 days prior to enrollment and >= 0.1.\n* Patients may previously have been on any regimen of chemotherapy completed at least one month prior. Patients may be on any stable form of anti-androgen therapy.\n* Males >= age 18.\n* All patients must have a life expectancy of > 6 months.\n* Patients must have an ECOG Performance Status of <= 1\n* Patients must have no clinically significant abnormalities of organ or bone marrow function\n* Patients must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document, and the willingness/ability to comply with the protocol activities.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be MALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Chemotherapy within one month prior to enrollment or plans to receive chemotherapy within one month after enrollment. Patients who are expected to require new or modified anti-androgen therapy during the course of the study are also excluded.\n* Patients may not be receiving any other Investigational Agents during the course of the study.\n* Patients who experience frequent symptoms of a gastrointestinal nature (e.g., diarrhea, abdominal bloating, constipation or pain) are excluded.\n* Known CNS metastases.\n* Patients who, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator, have a clinically significant co-morbid disease that is likely to affect the ability of the patient to complete the trial, interfere with their ability with measurement of self-reported outcomes or result in adverse events unrelated to TalityTM are excluded.\n* Patients with a history of food allergy are excluded.\n* Concomitant medications necessary to treat baseline disorders are allowed (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia).\n* Patients requiring concomitant medications that, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator, have an unacceptable risk of adverse effects due to their nature (e.g., anti-coagulant therapy, immuno-modulatory agents for autoimmune disease) must be excluded.\n* Pregnant or nursing patients will not be enrolled since prostate cancer is limited to males.\n* HIV-positive patients with active infections, HIV related cancer or poorly controlled viral loads must be excluded. HIV-positive patients who are stable on anti-viral therapy may be enrolled.",
