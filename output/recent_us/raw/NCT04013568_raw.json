Highly effective methods of contraception include:\n* Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation: oral, intravaginal, transdermal\n* Progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation: oral, injectable, implantable, intrauterine device (IUD)\n* Intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS)\n* Bilateral tubal occlusion\n* Vasectomized partner\n* Sexual abstinence These methods must be used starting at study enrollment and for the duration of study participation through 8 days after the last dose of motixafortide.\n\nMale subjects must agree to use an adequate method of contraception (barrier method) starting with the first day of G-CSF administration through 8 days after the last dose of motixafortide.\n\n* Ability to understand and willingness to sign an IRB approved written informed consent document.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 78 Years",
