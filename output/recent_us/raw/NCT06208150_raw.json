At least 8 doses of daratumumab in a previous line must be administered either as monotherapy or in combination with a daratumumab-free interval of ≥3 months AND patient may be daratumumab refractory defined as less than a partial remission (PR) achieved on prior daratumumab-based therapy or have exhibited progression within 60 days of receiving daratumumab. If previous therapy was autologous stem cell transplant (SCT), over 3 months must have elapsed after SCT.\n* Measurable disease as defined by > 0.5 g/dL serum monoclonal protein, >0.1 g/dL serum free light chains, >0.2 g/24 hrs urinary M-protein excretion, and/or measurable plasmacytoma(s).\n* Females of childbearing potential(FCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 10 - 14 days prior to and again within 24 hours of prescribing pomalidomide and must either commit to continued abstinence from heterosexual intercourse or begin TWO acceptable methods of birth control, one highly effective method and one additional effective method AT THE SAME TIME, at least 4 weeks before she starts taking pomalidomide. FCBP must also agree to ongoing pregnancy testing.\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1, or 2.\n* Able to take aspirin daily\n* Life expectancy must be greater than 3 months.\n* Be able to voluntarily sign and understand written informed consent.\n* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥750 cells/mm3 (.75 x 109/L)\n* Platelets count ≥ 50,000/mm3 (50 x 109/L)\n* Serum SGOT/AST ≤ 2.0 x upper limits of normal\n* Serum SGPT/ALT <3.0 x upper limits of normal\n* Serum creatinine ≤ 2.5 x upper limits of normal\n* Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limits of normal (Total bilirubin ≥ 1.5 x ULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin <35%)\n* All participants must be registered into the mandatory POMALYST REMS™ program and be willing and able to comply with the requirements of the POMALYST REMS™ program.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 75 Years",
