Presence of urethral stricture or bladder neck contracture\n7. History of urethral stricture\n8. Current or chronic urinary tract infection\n9. Prior urologic outlet surgical or minimally invasive procedure (e.g., Transurethral resection of the prostate [TURP], Holmium laser enucleation of the prostate [HoLEP,] Rezum, etc.).\n10.
