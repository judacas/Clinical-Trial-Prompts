    "inclusion_criteria": "* Participant must be 18 years of age inclusive at the time of signing the informed consent form (ICF).\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 2.\n* Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of MM and a. Has undergone stem cell transplant or is considered transplant ineligible, and b. Has failed at least 3 prior lines of anti-myeloma therapies, including an anti-cluster of differentiation (CD)38 antibody (e.g., daratumumab) alone or in combination and is refractory to an immunomodulatory agent (e.g., lenalidomide, pomalidomide) and a proteasome inhibitor (e.g., bortezomib, ixazomib, carfilzomib).\n* France specific: participants have failed at least 4 prior lines of anti-myeloma therapies\n* Participant has measurable disease per modified IMWG criteria.\n* Life expectancy of at least 6 months, in the opinion of the investigator.\n* Male and female participants agree to abide by protocol-defined contraceptive requirements.\n* Participant is capable of giving signed informed consent.\n* Participant meets country-specific inclusion criteria described in the protocol.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Symptomatic amyloidosis, active POEMS syndrome (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, myeloma protein, and skin changes), or active plasma cell leukemia at the time of screening.\n* Current corneal epithelial disease, except nonconfluent superficial punctate keratitis (SPK).\n* Evidence of active mucosal or internal bleeding.\n* Presence of an active renal condition.\n* Any serious and/or unstable pre-existing medical condition, psychiatric disorder, or other conditions that could interfere with the participant's safety, obtaining informed consent, or compliance with the study procedures.\n* Malignancies other than the disease under study, except for any other malignancy from which the participant has been disease free for >2 years and, will not affect the evaluation of the effects of the study treatment on the currently targeted malignancy (MM). Participants with curatively treated non-melanoma skin cancer may be enrolled without a 2-year restriction.\n* Evidence of cardiovascular risk as per the protocol criteria.\n* Pregnant or lactating female.\n* Active infection requiring antibiotic, antiviral, or antifungal treatment.\n* Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, unless the criteria in protocol can be met.\n* Hepatitis B and C will be excluded unless the criteria in protocol can be met.\n* Cirrhosis or current unstable liver or biliary disease.\n* Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) >2.5× upper limit of normal (ULN).\n* Total Bilirubin >1.5×ULN.\n* Systemic anti-MM therapy within <=14 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter.\n* Systemic therapy with high dose steroids within <=14 days before the first dose of study treatment.\n* Prior allogenic stem cell transplant.\n* Prior treatment with a monoclonal antibody <=30 days before the first dose of study treatment. Use of monoclonal antibodies for serious conditions unrelated to multiple myeloma, such as COVID, may be permitted.\n* Prior treatment with an anti-B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) targeted therapy or hypersensitivity reactions to any components of the study treatment.\n* Treatment with an antibody-drug conjugate.\n* Participant has received any major surgery <=4 weeks before the first dose of study treatment. An exception may be allowed for bone stabilizing surgery.\n* Inadequate bone marrow reserve or organ functions as demonstrated by any of the following: a. Absolute neutrophil count <1.0×10^9/L, b. Hemoglobin <8 gram/deciliter (g/dL), c. Platelet count <50×10^9/L, d. Spot urine (albumin/creatinine ratio) >500 milligram/gram (mg/g), e.
