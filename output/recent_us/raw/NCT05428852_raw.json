    "official_title": "A Phase 1 Open-label, First-in-human, Multicenter Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Antitumor Activity of Actinium-225-macropa-pelgifatamab (BAY 3546828) in Participants With Advanced Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC)",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* mCRPC with pathological confirmation of adenocarcinoma without small-cell or neuroendocrine features.\n* Previous treatment with at least 1 Novel androgen axis drug (NAAD) (e.g., enzalutamide, apalutamide, darolutamide and/or abiraterone).\n* Prior orchiectomy and/or ongoing androgen deprivation therapy and a castrate level of serum testosterone (<50 ng/dL or <1.7 nmol/L).\n* Prior taxane treatment:\n\n  * Dose Escalation: Participants must either have had prior treatment with at least 1 but no more than 2 taxane regimens, or been deemed ineligible for or refused taxane therapy on consultation with their physician\n  * Dose Expansion Group A: Participants must have had prior treatment with at least 1 but no more than 2 taxane regimens, in the castration-resistant setting\n  * Dose Expansion Group B: Participants must not have received taxane therapy since becoming castration-resistant\n  * Dose Expansion Group C: Participants must either have had prior treatment with at least 1 but no more than 2 taxane regimens*, or been deemed ineligible for or refused taxane therapy on consultation with their physician *A taxane regimen consists of a minimum of 2 treatment cycles (maximum number of cycles as per local guidelines). A treatment break within a taxane regimen may be given provided that another anticancer therapy is not administered during that time\n* Prior treatment with an established 177Lu-PSMA therapy (i.e., dose activity and cycles comparable to approved treatments) is required for participants in Dose Expansion Group C only. More specifically, to qualify for this expansion group, participants must meet all of the following criteria:\n\n  * Received a minimum of two cycles of 177Lu-PSMA\n  * Not discontinued 177Lu-PSMA treatment due to intolerance; and\n  * Not achieved a partial or complete response during the course of 177Lu-PSMA treatment.\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) of 0 or 1.\n* Adequate bone marrow, hepatic, and renal function, as assessed by the following laboratory requirements within 30 days before start of study intervention:\n\n  * Hemoglobin ≥9.0 g/dL\n  * Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1500/mm^3\n  * Platelet count ≥100,000/mm^3\n  * Total bilirubin ≤1.5 x the Upper limit of normal (ULN), or <= 3 ULN if the participant has a confirmed history of Gilbert's syndrome (note that participants with Gilbert's syndrome should be carefully evaluated for other liver-related disorders that may impact their suitability for this study).\n  * Alanine transaminase (ALT) and Aspartate transaminase (AST) ˂2.5 x ULN (≤5 x ULN for participants with liver involvement)\n  * Participants on a stable dose of anticoagulation therapy are allowed to participate if they have no sign of bleeding or clotting, and Prothrombin time international normalized ratio (PT/INR) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) test results are acceptable at the Investigator's discretion\n  * Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) >60 mL/min/1.73 m^2, according to the Modified Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) abbreviated formula and creatinine clearance (CrCl) >60 mL/min based on Cockcroft-Gault formula\n* Participants must have at least one Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-positive distant metastatic lesion on the screening PSMA PET/CT scan using the study-designated PSMA PET tracers, as determined by the site Investigator. For eligibility purposes, a PSMA-positive lesion must have activity greater than the liver by visual assessment of the screening PSMA PET/CT. A PSMA-positive metastatic lesion should not correspond to a normal tissue structure or benign lesion.\n* Documented progressive mCRPC per PCWG3, defined as meeting at least one of the following criteria:\n\n  * PSA-progression (defined as 2 consecutive increases over a previous reference value obtained at a minimum of 1-week intervals, with a minimum starting value of 2.0 ng/mL)\n  * Radiological progression in soft-tissue lesions according to PCWG3 modification of RECIST v1.1 criteria\n  * Progression of bone disease (defined as ≥2 new bone lesions according to PCWG3 bone scan criteria).\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be MALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Participants who have any of the following tumor lesions which are PSMA negative AND meet the size criteria below are excluded as determined by the site investigator. A PSMA-negative lesion for eligibility purposes must have activity equal to or less than the liver by visual assessment of the screening PSMA PET/CT scan using the study-designated PSMA PET/CT tracers. A PSMA-negative metastatic lesion should not correspond to a normal tissue structure or benign lesion.\n\n  * a. Any single or multiple lymph node(s) ≥2.5cm in the short axis.\n  * b. Any solid organ metastasis (e.g., lung, liver, adrenal glands, etc.) that is ≥1 cm in the short axis.\n  * c. Any bone metastasis with a soft tissue component ≥ 1cm in short axis with the soft tissue component being PSMA-negative. PSMA-negative osseous metastases without a soft tissue component do not exclude a participant.\n  * d. Predominantly necrotic lesions with greater than 1cm of enhancing tissue on contrast-enhanced Computer tomography / magnetic resonance imaging (CT/MRI).\n* Prior systemic anticancer therapy including chemotherapy, NAAD, biologic therapy, immunotherapy, or investigational therapies within 4 weeks of the start of study intervention, except luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) or gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). Start of study intervention is allowed in shorter timeframes if 5 half-lives of the prior drug(s) have elapsed.\n* Prior radiopharmaceutical treatment using actinium-225.\n* Other prior radiopharmaceutical treatments:\n\n  * Dose escalation and Dose expansion Groups A and B: Prior treatment with a radiopharmaceutical is prohibited.\n  * Dose expansion Group C: Prior treatment with a radiopharmaceutical is prohibited with the following exceptions: Prior treatment with radium-223 dichloride more than 3 months before the start of study intervention is permitted; and prior treatment with 177Lu PSMA more than 6 weeks before the start of study intervention is required.\n\nNote: Participants who have discontinued 177Lu-PSMA treatment due to intolerance or loss of initial response are excluded from Group C.\n\n* Prior definitive therapy (radiotherapy or surgery) completed less than 6 weeks before the start of study intervention. Note that palliative radiotherapy completed less than 6 weeks before the start of study intervention will be allowed if: (i) no more than 10% of the participants' bone marrow is irradiated, (ii) it does not encompass all potential target/measurable lesions for participants in dose expansion.\n* Toxic effects of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade ≥2 from prior anticancer therapy not yet stabilized or where significant post-treatment toxicities have been observed. Chronic toxic effects of CTCAE Grade ≤2 from prior anticancer therapy where no further resolution is expected do not require exclusion with agreement between the Investigator and Sponsor (e.g., chemotherapy-induced neuropathy, fatigue, alopecia, anorexia, etc.).\n* Dose Expansion Group A and B: Presence of >3 liver metastases, any diffuse liver metastasis, or PSMA-non-avid liver metastasis (uptake is lower or equal compared to healthy liver tissue).\n\nDose Expansion Group C: Presence of any liver metastasis (Bakht et al. 2023).",
