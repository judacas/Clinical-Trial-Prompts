    "inclusion_criteria": "* PRE-REGISTRATION: Histologically confirmed muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. Variant histology, including neuroendocrine differentiation, is allowed if urothelial cancer is predominant histology (any amount of squamous differentiation is allowed provided the tumor is not a pure squamous cell cancer)\n* PRE-REGISTRATION: Patient must have had radical cystectomy and lymph node dissection >= 3 weeks, but =< 12 weeks prior to pre-registration. Patients who have had a partial cystectomy as definitive therapy are not eligible\n* PRE-REGISTRATION: No gross cancer at the surgical margins. Microscopic invasive urothelial carcinoma at the surgical margins (i.e., \"positive margins\") are allowed. Carcinoma in situ (CIS) at margins is considered negative margins\n* PRE-REGISTRATION: No evidence of residual cancer or metastasis after cystectomy (imaging is not required prior to pre-registration but is required prior to registration)\n* PRE-REGISTRATION: Have undergone a radical cystectomy with pathological evidence of urothelial carcinoma of the bladder at high risk of recurrence as described in one of the two scenarios below (i or ii). The 7th edition of American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging will be utilized.:\n\n  * (i) Patients who have not received neoadjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy: pT3-pT4* or pT0/x-pT4/N+ on cystectomy and are not eligible for adjuvant cisplatin chemotherapy\n\n    * (i) Patients ineligible for cisplatin due to at least one of the following criteria and reason for ineligibility should be documented:\n\n      * (i) Creatinine Clearance (using Cockcroft-Gault): < 60 mL/min\n      * (i) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5, grade >= 2 audiometric hearing loss\n      * (i) CTCAE version 5, grade >= 2 or above peripheral neuropathy\n      * New York Heart Association Class III heart failure\n      * (i) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status = 2\n    * (i) Patients who are eligible for cisplatin may be candidates if they refuse available adjuvant chemotherapy, despite being informed by the investigator about the treatment options. The patient's refusal must be documented.\n\n      * (i) Patients with pT2N0 urothelial cancer on cystectomy (without prior neoadjuvant chemotherapy) with ctDNA(+) Signatera results based on an assay performed post-cystectomy as part of routine care outside of the study may proceed with pre-registration but require confirmation of ctDNA(+) Signatera testing on repeat \"central testing\" in the context of A032103 testing. Patients with pT2N0 with central testing not confirming ctDNA(+) will not be eligible for A032103 (Note: this is distinct from patients with ypT2N0 who are eligible based on ii).\n  * (ii) Patients who received cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy: ypT2-ypT4 or ypT0/x-pT4/N+ on cystectomy\n* PRE-REGISTRATION: Available tumor tissue for central Signatera testing to be submitted after pre-registration. Central testing is defined as testing performed as part of the A032103 study prior to registration and is provided by the study and not routine standard commercial testing. Patients who have already had Signatera testing performed as part of routine care will require repeat central testing as part of the A032103 study to be eligible for registration/randomization. Tumor tissue from the cystectomy is preferred over tissue from prior transurethral resection\n* PRE-REGISTRATION: Age >= 18 years\n* PRE-REGISTRATION: ECOG Performance Status 0-2\n* PRE-REGISTRATION: Not pregnant and not nursing, because this study involves an agent that has known genotoxic, mutagenic and teratogenic effects\n* PRE-REGISTRATION: No postoperative/adjuvant systemic therapy after cystectomy\n* PRE-REGISTRATION: No adjuvant radiation after cystectomy\n* PRE-REGISTRATION: No treatment with any other type of investigational agent =< 4 weeks before pre-registration\n* PRE-REGISTRATION: Not have ever received prior treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade.\n* PRE-REGISTRATION: Not have ever received prior treatment with LAG-3 blockade.\n* PRE-REGISTRATION: Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen are eligible for this trial\n* PRE-REGISTRATION: Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) >= 1,200/mm^3\n* PRE-REGISTRATION: Platelet count >= 100,000/mm^3\n* PRE-REGISTRATION: Hemoglobin >= 8 g/dL\n* PRE-REGISTRATION: Creatinine =< 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) or calculated (calc.) creatinine clearance > 30 mL/min (using either Cockcroft-Gault formula or Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation\n* PRE-REGISTRATION: Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) =< 3 x ULN\n* PRE-REGISTRATION: Total bilirubin =< 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) (except in patients with Gilbert Syndrome, who can have total bilirubin < 3.0 mg/dL)\n* PRE-REGISTRATION: For women of childbearing potential only: A negative urine or serum pregnancy test done =< 14 days prior to pre-registration is required\n* PRE-REGISTRATION: Not currently requiring hemodialysis\n* PRE-REGISTRATION: No current or prior history of myocarditis\n* PRE-REGISTRATION: No active autoimmune disease or history of autoimmune disease that might recur, which may affect vital organ function or require immune suppressive treatment including systemic corticosteroids. These include but are not limited to patients with a history of immune related neurologic disease, multiple sclerosis, autoimmune (demyelinating) neuropathy, Guillain-Barre syndrome, myasthenia gravis; systemic autoimmune disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), connective tissue diseases, scleroderma, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's, ulcerative colitis, hepatitis; and patients with a history of toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens- Johnson syndrome, or phospholipid syndrome because of the risk of recurrence or exacerbation of disease.\n* PRE-REGISTRATION: Patients with vitiligo, endocrine deficiencies including type I diabetes mellitus, thyroiditis managed with replacement hormones including physiologic corticosteroids are eligible.\n* PRE-REGISTRATION: Patients with rheumatoid arthritis and other arthropathies, SjoÌˆgren's syndrome and psoriasis controlled with topical medication and patients with positive serology, such as antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-thyroid antibodies should be evaluated for the presence of target organ involvement and potential need for systemic treatment but should otherwise be eligible.\n* PRE-REGISTRATION: No current pneumonitis or prior history of non-infectious pneumonitis that required steroids within the previous 5 years.\n* PRE-REGISTRATION: No known active hepatitis B (e.g., hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] reactive) or hepatitis C (e.g., hepatitis C virus [HCV] ribonucleic acid [RNA] [qualitative] is detected).\n* PRE-REGISTRATION: For patients with evidence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, the HBV viral load must be undetectable on suppressive therapy, if indicated. Patients with a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection must have been treated and cured.
