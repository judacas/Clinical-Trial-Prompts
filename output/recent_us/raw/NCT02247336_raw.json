Platelets ≥100K/μL) without transfusion\n  5. Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL\n  6. Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) [calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault formula]\n  7.

Negative HIV test at screening, with the following exception: Participants with a positive HIV test at screening are eligible provided they are stable on anti-retroviral therapy, have a CD4 count ≥ 200/µL, and have an undetectable viral load. *** NOTE: A participant may be eligible if test is positive and will be left to the investigator to determine appropriateness for trial enrollment if medically stable and without signs of active, uncontrolled disease. Prior to formal enrollment, please contact protocol study PI to review.\n  13. Negative hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody test at screening, or positive HCV antibody test followed by a negative HCV RNA test at screening. The HCV RNA test must be performed for participants who have a positive HCV antibody test.*** NOTE: A participant may be eligible if test is positive and will be left to the investigator to determine appropriateness for trial enrollment if medically stable and without signs of active, uncontrolled disease.

Prior to formal enrollment, please contact protocol study PI to review.\n  15. Women of child-bearing potential and men with partners of child-bearing potential must agree to practice sexual abstinence or to use the forms of contraception listed in Child-Bearing Potential/Pregnancy section and below for the duration of study participation and for 180 DAYS/6 MONTHS following completion of therapy. Men must refrain from donating sperm during this same period.\n\n      1. A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarchal, has not reached a postmenopausal state (≥ 12 continuous months of amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone surgical sterilization (removal of ovaries, fallopian tubes and/or uterus) or another cause as determined by the investigator (e.g., Müllerian agenesis). Per this definition, a woman with a tubal ligation is considered to be of childbearing potential. The definition of childbearing potential may be adapted for alignment with local guidelines or requirements.\n      2. Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of < 1% per year include bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, hormonal contraceptives that inhibit ovulation, hormone-releasing intrauterine devices, and copper intrauterine devices.\n      3. The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not adequate methods of contraception. If required per local guidelines or regulations, locally recognized adequate methods of contraception and information about the reliability of abstinence will be described in the local Informed Consent Form.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
