Effective birth control methods are: copper IUD (intrauterine device), diaphragm/cervical cap/shield, spermicide, contraceptive sponge, condoms. Should a female patient become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.\n\n  * NOTE: A FOCBP is any woman (regardless of sexual orientation, having undergone a tubal ligation, or remaining celibate by choice) who meets the following criteria:\n\n    * Has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy\n    * Has had menses at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months (and therefore has not been naturally postmenopausal for > 12 months).\n* FOCBP must have a negative urine pregnancy test within 7 days prior to registration on study.\n* Willingness to avoid exposing breast skin to natural or artificial sunlight (i.e. tanning beds) for the duration of the study drug use.\n* Patients must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent prior to registration on study.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be FEMALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Patients receiving any other investigational agents within 30 days of registration are not eligible.\n* Patients currently using oral selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMS) (tamoxifen, raloxifene, bazedoxifene) are not eligible.\n\n  * Note: Prior or current endocrine therapy other than SERMs are allowed.\n* Patients who have a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition afimoxifene (4-OHT) are not eligible.\n* Patients who have an uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to any of the following, are not eligible:\n\n  * Hypertension that is not controlled on medication\n  * Ongoing or active infection requiring systemic treatment\n  * Symptomatic congestive heart failure\n  * Unstable angina pectoris\n  * Cardiac arrhythmia\n  * Psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements\n  * Any other illness or condition that the treating investigator feels would interfere with study compliance or would compromise the patient?s safety or study endpoints.\n* Female patients who are pregnant or nursing are not eligible.\n* Patients with prior bilateral breast cancer radiotherapy or radiotherapy for lymphoma will be excluded.\n* Patients with skin lesions on the breast that disrupt the stratum corneum (e.g. eczema, ulceration) are not eligible.\n* Patients with a history of endometrial neoplasia are not eligible.\n* Patients with a history of thromboembolic disease are not eligible.\n\n  * Note: history of varicose veins and superficial phlebitis is allowed.\n* Patients who are undergoing active treatment for any malignancy will be excluded.\n* Male patients are excluded from this study since there are no data regarding skin penetration of 4-OHT though male chest wall skin (which is thicker and hairier than female chest wall skin).",
