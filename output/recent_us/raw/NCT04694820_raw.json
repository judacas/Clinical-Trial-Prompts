Participants with any stage of prostate cancer are eligible, as long as treatment with at least 24 weeks of ADT is recommended by their treating physician.\n* Participants must have been prescribed a plan for treatment with at least 24 weeks of ADT, and can have received up to 12 weeks of ADT therapy.\n* Participants must be willing to participate in two CV CARE visits at weeks 12 and 24 after ADT initiation.\n* Participants must be willing to have their follow up visits for ADT management at DFCI Longwood site.\n* Participants must be willing to undergo lab and blood pressure assessments, which can include local labs and home blood pressure checks if they wish to do virtual visits for follow up care.\n* Participants can have pre-existing CVD and/or CV risk factors, but this is not a requirement for inclusion.\n* Participants receiving combination treatment with an androgen receptor signaling inhibitory, some examples being (abiraterone acetate, enzalutamide, darolutamide, apalutamide, or bicalutamide), immunotherapy (pembrolizumab), or PARP inhibitor (olaparib, rucaparib) are eligible.\n* Age â‰¥18 years.\n* Life expectancy of greater than 6 months.\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be MALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",

ADT therapy is defined as either a GnRH agonist or antagonist.\n* Participants receiving combination treatment with ADT and chemotherapy (docetaxel, cabazitaxel, carboplatin), radioligand therapy (radium-223, 177PSMA-lutetium-617), or treatment on a clinical trial are not eligible due to potential for more intensive symptom management that may be required for optimal support of their cancer-directed treatment.\n* Participants actively included in therapeutic clinical trials are not eligible due to their greater time constraints.",
