Human epidermal growth factor receptor positive (HER2+) MBC (metastatic breast cancer)\n   5. Other solid tumors (e.g., non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, carcinoma of unknown primary) with the exception of rapidly progressing neoplasms (e.g., pancreatic cancer, glioblastoma, hepatocellular carcinoma)\n\n   Note: Subjects with RCC and GC are a priority and should constitute approximately 50% (12 subjects) of the enrolled popululation. Enrollment of all others will be capped when reaching a combined 50%, in order to maintain 12 slots for subjects with RCC and GC.\n4. Have at least 1 radiologically measurable lesion as per RECIST v 1.1, defined as a lesion that is at least 10 mm in longest diameter or lymph node and that is at least 15 mm in short axis imaged by CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and obtained by imaging within 28 days prior to screening. Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area are considered measurable if progression has been demonstrated in such lesions\n5. Have resolution of all previous treatment related toxicities to Grade 1 severity or lower, except for stable sensory neuropathy (≤ Grade 2) and alopecia. If the subject received major surgery or radiation therapy of >30 Gy, they must have recovered from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention\n6. Provided there are suitable and accessible lesions, no biopsy contraindications, minimal risk of complications and a positive informed decision, subject as are willing to provide fresh tissue for biomarker analysis, and, based on the adequacy of the tissue sample quality, for assessment of biomarker status. Two biopsies will be necessary: at baseline (within 30 days prior to first dose) and within 7 days after Cycle 3/Day 1.\n\n   Newly obtained biopsy specimens are preferred to archived samples and formalin- fixed, paraffin-embedded block specimens are preferred to slides. In the event a fresh pre-treatment biopsy is not able to be provided, the most recent archival biopsy must be provided in its place\n7. Have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 and sustained between screening and initiation of dosing on Day 1\n8. QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia's (QTcF) method ≤450 msec\n9. Have an albumin level of ≥3 g/dL at screening\n10. Have life expectancy of 3 months or greater as determined by the treating physician\n11. Have adequate organ function within 15 days prior to first administration of study drug on Day 1, as defined by meeting all of the following criteria:\n\n    1. Total bilirubin ≤1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) OR direct bilirubin ≤ ULN for subjects with total bilirubin levels >1.5 x ULN\n    2. Aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase ≤2.5 × ULN or ≤5 × ULN for subjects with known hepatic metastases\n    3. Fasting serum glucose within normal range and hemoglobin A1c ≤8%\n    4. Thyroid function tests (thyroid stimulating hormone [TSH] within normal limits for subjects with normal thyroid function and free thyroxine [FT4]) within normal limits for subjects on thyroid treatment\n12. Have adequate renal function within 15 days prior to first administration of study drug on Day 1, as defined by creatinine ≤1.5 × ULN and creatinine clearance ≥30 mL/min, as per the below Cockcroft Gault formula\n13. Have adequate hematologic function within 15 days prior to first administration of study drug on Day 1, as defined by meeting all of the following criteria:\n\n    1. Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL (uncorrected by red blood cell transfusion or erythropoietin support)\n    2. Absolute neutrophil count ≥1.5 × 109/L\n    3. Platelet count ≥100 × 109/L\n14. Have adequate coagulation function within 15 days prior to first administration of study drug on Day 1, as defined by either of the following criteria:\n\n    1. International normalized ratio (INR) <1.5 × ULN OR for subjects receiving warfarin or low molecular weight heparin, the subject must, in the investigator's opinion, be clinically stable with no evidence of active bleeding while receiving anticoagulant therapy. The INR for these subjects may exceed 1.5 × ULN if that is the goal of anticoagulant therapy\n    2. Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) <1.5 × ULN unless subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy, provided prothrombin time or aPTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants\n15. Female subject of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required\n16. Female subject of childbearing potential must be willing to use an adequate form of contraception from the first dose of study medication through 90 days after the last dose of study drug\n17. Female subject must agree not to breastfeed and not to donate ova starting at screening and throughout the study treatment, and for 90 days after the last dose of study drug\n18. Male subject with a pregnant or breastfeeding partner(s) must agree to remain abstinent or use a condom for the duration of the pregnancy or for the time partner is breastfeeding throughout the study period and for 90 days after the last dose of study drug\n19. Male subject with female partner(s) of childbearing potential must not donate sperm during the treatment period and for at least 90 days after the last dose of study drug\n20. Male subject with female partner(s) of childbearing potential should agree to use a highly effective method of contraception during the treatment period and for at least 90 days after the last dose of the study drug\n21.
