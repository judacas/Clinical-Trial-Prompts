    "inclusion_criteria": "* Signed informed consent.\n* Documentation of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, as determined by a molecular (nucleic acid) or antigen test from any respiratory tract specimen (e.g. oropharyngeal, nasopharyngeal (NP), or nasal swab, or saliva) collected ≤240 hours (10 days) prior to study entry.

For a potential participant who regularly receives chronic supplementary oxygen for an underlying lung condition, their oxygen saturation should be measured while on their standard home oxygen supplementation level.\n* Participant must agree not to participate in another clinical trial for the treatment of COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 during the study period until hospitalization or 28 days after the start of the study, whichever occurs first.\n* Meet the protocol definition of being at \"higher\" risk of progression to hospitalization or death (BRII-196/BRII-198).\n* In Phase III, meeting the protocol definition of being at \"higher\" risk of progression to hospitalization or death (SNG001, SAB-185, BMS 986414+BMS 986413)\n* For participants of reproductive potential, negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 48 hours prior to study entry by any clinic or laboratory that has a CLIA certification or its equivalent, or by a point of care (POC)/CLIA-waived test. Note: Participants not of reproductive potential are eligible without requiring the use of a contraceptive method (BRII-196/BRII-198. AZD7442 [IV], AZD7442 [IM], SNG001, Camostat, SAB-185, BMS 986414+BMS 986413).\n* Participants that engage in sexual activity that may lead to pregnancy in their partner must agree to either remain abstinent or use male contraceptives. They are strongly advised to inform their non-pregnant sexual partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraceptives for 24 weeks after investigational product is administered. Participants with pregnant partners should use condoms during vaginal intercourse through 24 weeks after investigational agent administration. Participants should refrain from sperm donation for 24 weeks after investigational agent administration (BRII-196/BRII-198, AZD7442 [IV], AZD7442 [IM], SAB-185).\n* Participants that engage in sexual activity that may lead to pregnancy in their partner must agree to either remain abstinent or use male contraceptives for 30 days after investigational agent administration. They are also strongly advised to inform their non-pregnant sexual partners of reproductive potential to sue effective contraceptives for 30 days after investigational agent is administered to the participant. Participants with pregnant partners should use condoms during vaginal intercourse through 30 days after last dose of investigational agent administration. Participants should refrain from sperm donation for 30 days after investigational agent administration (SNG001).\n* Participants that engage in sexual activity that may lead to pregnancy in their partner must agree to either remain abstinent or use male contraceptives. They are also strongly advised to inform their non-regnant sexual partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraceptives from study entry through 90 days after study treatment. Participants with pregnant partners should use condoms during vaginal intercourse from study entry through 90 days after the last dose of the study treatment. Participants should refrain from sperm donation from study entry through 90 days after the last dose of study treatment (Camostat).\n* If participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy, participants who are of reproductive potential must agree to use effective contraception for 24 weeks after investigational agent is administered. This would include oral contraceptives, implanted contraceptives, implanted contraceptives, intrauterine devices, and barrier methods.\n* If participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy, participants who are of reproductive potential must agree to use highly effective contraception for 24 weeks after investigational agent is administered (AZD7442 [IV], AZD7442 [IM], SAB-185).\n* If participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy, participants who are of reproductive potential must agree to use effective contraception for 30 days after investigational agent is administered (SNG001).\n* If participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy, participants who are of reproductive potential must agree to use effective contraception for 90 days after the last dose of treatment (Camostat).\n* If participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy, participants who are of reproductive potential must agree to use highly effective contraception for at least 48 weeks after the investigational agent is administered (BMS 986414+BMS 986413).\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
