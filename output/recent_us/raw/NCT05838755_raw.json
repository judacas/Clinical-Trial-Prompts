Patients are permitted to have primary tumor in situ (Neoadjuvant Arm only).\n2. Has received previous oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy.\n\n   1. FOLFOX or capecitabine combined with oxaliplatin (CapeOx) does not need to be a direct lead-in to this study.\n   2. If chemotherapy is a direct lead-in to this study, concurrent mAb therapy (bevacizumab, cetuximab, or panitumumab) is acceptable, however the antibody must be omitted from the final cycle of chemotherapy prior to pembrolizumab.\n3. Is an appropriate candidate to undergo liver biopsy and resection (+/-ablation) of liver metastases (Neoadjuvant Arm Only).\n4.

Has measurable disease based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 as assessed by the investigator. Lesions situated in a previously irradiated area are considered measurable if progression has been demonstrated in such lesions (Neoadjuvant Arm Only).\n7. Is willing to provide tissue from a newly obtained core or excisional biopsy of a tumor lesion. Newly-obtained is defined as a specimen obtained after last dose of standard of care lead-in chemotherapy [if applicable] and within 28 days prior to first dose of pembrolizumab (Neoadjuvant Arm Only).\n8.

Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication (day 1). If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required.\n11. Female patients of childbearing potential must be willing to use an adequate method of contraception for the course of the study through 120 days after the last dose of study medication.\n12. Male patients of childbearing potential must agree to use an adequate method of contraception, starting with the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy.\n\n    *Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and preferred contraception for the patient.\n13. Have locally confirmed microsatellite stable (MSS) or Mismatch repair proficient (pMMR) Colorectal cancer (CRC). MSS is defined as 0-1 allelic shifts among 3-5 tumor microsatellite loci using a Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assay. pMMR is defined as presence of protein expression of 4 DNA mismatch repair (MMR) enzymes (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2) by immunohistochemistry.\n14. Have no radiographic evidence of malignancy as assessed by Investigator (Adjuvant Phase Only).\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Is currently participating and receiving study therapy or has participated in a study of an investigational agent and received study therapy or used an investigational device within 4 weeks of the first dose of treatment.\n\n   * Note: Patients who have entered the follow-up phase of an investigational study may participate as long as it has been 4 weeks since the last dose of the previous investigational agent or device use.\n2.

Has a known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. No HIV testing is required unless mandated by local health authority.\n4. Has an active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in past 2 years (i.e., with use of disease-modifying agents, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency) is not considered a form of systemic treatment and is allowed.\n5. Has active hepatitis B (defined as hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) reactive) or active hepatitis C virus (HCV) (defined as HCV RNA [qualitative] is detected) infection.\n6. Has received prior anti-cancer monoclonal antibody (mAb), systemic anticancer therapy other than FOLFOX (including investigational agents), targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy within 14 days prior to the first dose of study treatment (day 1).\n\n   * Note: Patients must have recovered from all adverse events (AEs) due to a previous therapies to =< grade 1 or baseline. Patients with grade 2 neuropathy or alopecia are eligible. If a patient received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting study treatment.\n7.

This exception does not include carcinomatous meningitis which is excluded regardless of clinical stability.\n12.
