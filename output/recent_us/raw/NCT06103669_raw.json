Known history or evidence of active, non-infectious pneumonitis\n6. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including but not limited to ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina pectoris, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, active interstitial lung disease, serious chronic gastrointestinal conditions associated with diarrhea, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirement, substantially increase the risk of incurring adverse events, or compromise the ability of the participant to give written informed consent\n7. Participants with documented myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident within 6 months prior to enrollment\n8. History of another primary malignancy, except for:\n\n   * Malignancy treated with curative intent and with no known active disease ≥2 years before the first dose of investigational product and of low potential risk for recurrence\n   * Adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer or lentigo maligna without evidence of disease\n   * Adequately treated carcinoma in situ without evidence of disease\n9. History of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis\n10. Active infection including tuberculosis, hepatitis B or hepatitis C. Participants with a past or resolved hepatitis B infection or participants positive for hepatitis C antibody with negative hepatitis C virus RNA on polymerase chain reaction are eligible to enroll. Participants with HIV with undetectable viral load and CD4 cell count ≥200 cells/mm3 are eligible to enroll\n11. Any unresolved toxicity per CTCAE version 5.0 grade ≥2 from a previous anticancer therapy, except for alopecia, vitiligo and the laboratory values defined in the inclusion criteria.\n\n    * Participants with grade ≥2 neuropathy will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis after consultation with the study physician\n    * Participants with irreversible toxicity not reasonably expected to be exacerbated by treatment with durvalumab may be included only after consultation with the study physician\n12. Untreated brain metastases or spinal cord compression. Participants with suspected brain metastases at screening should have an MRI (preferred) or CT scan, each preferably with IV contrast of the brain prior to study entry\n13. Known allergy or hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs or any of the study drug excipients\n14. Any concurrent chemotherapy, investigational product, biologic or hormonal therapy for cancer treatment\n\n    • Concurrent use of hormonal therapy for non-cancer related conditions is acceptable\n15. Receipt of live attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to the enrollment\n16. Major surgical procedure within 28 days prior to enrollment.\n17. Prior locoregional therapy with radioembolization\n18. Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 14 days before the first dose of durvalumab with the following exceptions:\n\n    * Intranasal, inhaled, or topical steroids or local steroid injection\n    * Systemic corticosteroids at physiologic doses not to exceed 10mg/day of prednisone or its equivalent\n    * Steroids as premedication for hypersensitivity reactions\n19. Participation in another clinical study with an investigational product administered in the last 3 months\n20. Concurrent enrollment in another clinical study, unless it is an observational clinical study or during the follow-up period of an interventional study\n21. Female participants who are pregnant or breastfeeding or male or female participants of reproductive potential who are not willing to use effective birth control from screening to 180 days after the last dose of gemcitabine/cisplatin or 90 days after the last dose of durvalumab\n22. Judgement by the investigator that the participant should not participate in the study if they are unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions, and requirements\n23. Participants on anti-arrhythmic medication unless they are deemed fit for HT by a consultant cardiologist and there is no increased risk to the patient from HT because of the arrhythmia in the opinion of the treating physician\n24. Severe COPD with FEV1 < 50% of expected\n25. Participants whose right-to-left pelvic/abdominal dimension is > 49 cm\n26. Participants with incorporated metallic implants such as metallic stents, pacemakers or defibrillators, and orthopedic rods and plates of dimensions > 1000/frequency (MHz) aa.
