Total bilirubin ≥ 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) (Note: Patients with known Gilbert disease without other clinically significant liver abnormalities are not excluded.)\n  2. AST(SGOT) and ALT(SGPT) ≥ 1.5 × ULN\n* Negative serum pregnancy test (in females of childbearing potential) within 48 hours of starting evolocumab.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Any patient with a history of a serious hypersensitivity reaction to evolocumab or any of the excipients in evolocumab\n* Patients with severe hepatic impairment outside of the range defined in the inclusion criteria within 7 days of starting evolocumab.\n* History or evidence of central nervous system bleeding as defined by stroke or intraocular bleed (including embolic stroke) not associated with any antitumor surgery within 6 months before enrollment\n* Infection requiring intravenous antibiotics that was completed < 1 week of study enrollment (day 1) with the exemption of prophylactic antibiotics for long line insertion or biopsy\n* Females of reproductive potential and males who are unwilling to practice an acceptable method(s) of effective birth control while on study through 1 month (2 half-lives) after receiving the last dose of study drug.",
