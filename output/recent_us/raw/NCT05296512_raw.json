    "exclusion_criteria": "* Pregnancy or breast-feeding\n* Active infection requiring IV antibiotics 7 days before enrollment\n* Signs of wound-healing problems or infection at the craniotomy/biopsy site.\n* Prior, unrelated malignancy requiring current active treatment with the exception of cervical carcinoma in situ and adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin\n* Co-medication that may interfere with study results; e.g. immuno-suppressive agents other than corticosteroids\n* Prior treatment with radiotherapy or chemotherapy for a brain tumor, irrespective of the grade of the tumor\n* Evidence of > grade 1 CNS hemorrhage on baseline MRI on CT scan\n* Systemic treatment with inducers or strong inhibitors of cytochrome P450 within four days before enrollment or planned treatment during the time period of the study.\n* Metal in the body (except dental fillings) e.g., pacemaker, infusion pump, metal aneurysm clip, metal prosthesis, joint, rod or plate.\n* Severe allergy to contrast agent.\n* Inadequately controlled hypertension\n* Active or history of postural hypotension and autonomic dysfunction\n* Clinically significant (i.e. active) cardiovascular disease or cerebrovascular disease, for example cerebrovascular accidents ≤ 6 months prior to study enrollment, myocardial infarction ≤ 6 months prior to study enrollment, unstable angina, New York Heart Association (NYHA) Grade II or greater congestive heart failure (CHF), or serious cardiac arrhythmia uncontrolled by medication or potentially interfering with protocol treatment\n* History or evidence upon physical/neurological examination of central nervous system disease (e.g. seizures) unrelated to cancer unless adequately controlled by medication or potentially interfering with protocol treatment\n* Significant vascular disease (e.g., aortic aneurysm requiring surgical repair or recent arterial thrombosis) within 6 months prior to start of study treatment\n* A marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval (e.g., repeated demonstration of a QTc interval >480 milliseconds (ms) (CTCAE grade 1)\n* A known history of additional risk factors for Torsades de Pointes (TdP) (e.g., congestive heart failure, hypokalemia, known family history of Long QT Syndrome).",
