Any unresolved Grade 2 or greater toxicity from previous anticancer therapy except alopecia.\n5. Any herbal medicine without anti-tumor intent within one week before the first dose of study drug.\n6. History of interstitial lung disease, noninfectious pneumonitis, or uncontrolled lung diseases, including but not limited to pulmonary fibrosis, active pneumonitis.\n7. Severe cardiovascular disease, including cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic attack, myocardial infarction, or unstable angina, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV heart failure or uncontrolled arrhythmia within 6 months of the first dose.\n8. Has the average corrected QT interval by Fridericia's formula (QTcF) prolongation to > 480 millisecond (ms) based on 12-lead ECG in triplicate, or with a history of additional risk factors for torsade de pointes (e.g., heart failure, hypokalemia, family history of long QT syndrome or unexplained sudden death under 40 years of age in first degree relatives).\n9. Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic pressure >150mmHg or diastolic pressure > 90mmHg).\n10. Severe intestinal disease, including but not limited to:\n\n    1. Peptic ulcer disease in the past 3 months prior to the first dosing.\n    2. Clinically significant gastrointestinal bleeding as evidenced by hematemesis, hematochezia, or melena in the past 3 months prior to the first dosing without evidence of resolution documented by endoscopy or colonoscopy.\n    3. Active colitis requiring ongoing treatment within 4 weeks prior to the first dosing, including infectious colitis, radiation colitis and ischemic colitis.\n    4. History of ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease.\n11. Active or uncontrolled infections requiring IV of antibiotics, antivirals, or antifungals.\n12. Active viral (any etiology) hepatitis except with the viral load below the limit quantification (hepatitis B virus (HBV) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) < 1000 copies/mL or 200 IU/mL; hepatitis C virus (HCV) ribonucleic acid (RNA) below the limit of quantification).\n13.

Has known hypersensitivity to either the drug substances or inactive ingredients in the drug product.\n16. Prior severe hypersensitivity to other antibodies, which in the opinion of the Investigator suggests an increased potential for hypersensitivity to study drug.\n17. Is currently participating and receiving study therapy or has participated in a study of an investigational agent and received study therapy or used an investigation device within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug.\n18. Has a history or current evidence of any severe condition, concurrent therapy (e.g., psychiatric, substance abuse), or laboratory abnormality that might confound the interpretation of the study results, interfere with the subject's participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the investigator.\n\n    Additional Exclusion Criteria for Part 2 only (for Pharmacodynamic Cohorts)\n19.
