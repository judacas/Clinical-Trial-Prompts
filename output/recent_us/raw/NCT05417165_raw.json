Female participants must have a negative serum pregnancy test result at Screening and negative urine pregnancy test at admission to the study site, are not currently breastfeeding, and meet one of the following criteria:\n\n   1. Surgically sterile for at least 3 months prior to Screening by one of the following means:\n\n      * Bilateral tubal ligation\n      * Bilateral salpingectomy (with or without oophorectomy)\n      * Surgical hysterectomy\n      * Bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy)\n   2. Postmenopausal, defined as the following:\n\n      * Last menstrual period greater than 12 months prior to Screening without an alternative medical cause, AND\n      * Postmenopausal status confirmed by serum Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) concentration at Screening > 40 mIU/mL\n   3. Female participants of childbearing potential must use at least one of the following protocol-specified highly effective methods of birth control, AND must agree to use barrier contraception (male condom) during heterosexual intercourse, from the time of Screening until at least 90 days after EQ143 treatment:\n\n      * Infertile male partner (eg, vasectomy [at least 6 months prior to Screening; vasectomized partner should be the sole partner of the female participant], permanently sterile following bilateral orchidectomy, or any other documented cause of infertility)\n      * Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception (oral, intravaginal, transdermal, injectable)\n      * Progestogen-only hormonal contraception (oral, injectable, implantable)\n      * Implantable device (implantable rod or intrauterine device)\n      * Bilateral tubal occlusion Alternatively, females of childbearing potential must practice complete abstinence (defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant; periodic abstinence and withdrawal are not acceptable) from Screening until at least 90 days after EQ143 treatment. It is not necessary to use any other method of contraception when complete abstinence is elected. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) who choose complete abstinence must continue to have pregnancy tests as per protocol. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated by the Investigator in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.\n\n   Participants must agree to not donate sperm or ova from time of EQ143 administration until 90 days after EQ143 treatment.\n6.
