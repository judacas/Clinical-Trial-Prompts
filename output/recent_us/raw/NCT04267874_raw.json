    "inclusion_criteria": "* Have non-metastatic cancer\n* Be chemotherapy na√Øve\n* Be scheduled to receive CIPN-inducing chemotherapy during the study (platinums, vinca alkaloids, taxanes, thalidomide, or bortezomib) for the duration of the intervention (12 weeks)\n* Report symptoms of peripheral neuropathy at baseline (subject-reported severity of numbness and tingling in hands/feet of at least 1 on a 0-10 scale)\n* Be able to perform the exercise intervention\n* Be able to read English\n* Be at least 18 years old (no upper limit on age)\n* Be consistently right-handed in daily activities for consistency in reporting any lateralized effects from brain imaging\n* Provide written informed consent\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Receive surgery, radiation, or hormone therapy for their cancer during the study\n* Be in the active or maintenance stage of exercise behavior (i.e., subjects must be sedentary)\n* Have contraindications for MRI scanning (pacemaker, metal implants, pregnancy, etc. - note that most port-a-caths are safe for MRI scanning)\n* Have physical limitations (e.g., cardiorespiratory, orthopedic, central nervous system) that contraindicate participation in maximal physiological fitness testing and a low/moderate intensity home-based walking and progressive resistance exercise program.",
