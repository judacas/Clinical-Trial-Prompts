    "official_title": "Phase I Study of Tas-102 and Radioembolization With 90Y Resin Microspheres for Chemo-refractory Colorectal Liver Metastases",
    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Male or female, 18 years of age or older, and of any ethnic or racial group.\n2. Diagnosis of unresectable metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma with liver-dominant bilobar disease. Diagnosis may be made by histo- or cyto-pathology, or by clinical and imaging criteria.\n3. Disease progression or intolerance to at least two prior Food and Drug Administration-approved therapeutic regimens.\n4. If extrahepatic disease is present, it must be asymptomatic.\n5. If a primary tumor is in place, it must be asymptomatic.\n6. Measurable target tumors using standard imaging techniques (RECIST v. 1.1 criteria).\n7. Tumor replacement < 50% of total liver volume.\n8. Current Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 through screening to first treatment on study.\n9. Completion of prior systemic therapy at least 14 days prior to enrollment.\n10. Able to understand informed consent.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. At risk of hepatic or renal failure\n\n   * Serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dl\n   * Serum bilirubin > 1.3 mg/ml\n   * Albumin < 2.0 g/dL\n   * Aspartate and/or alanine aminotransferase level > 5 times upper normal limit\n   * Any history of hepatic encephalopathy\n   * Cirrhosis or portal hypertension\n   * Clinically evident ascites (trace ascites on imaging is acceptable)\n2. Contraindications to angiography and selective visceral catheterization\n\n   * Any bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy that is not correctable by usual therapy or hemostatic agents (e.g. closure device)\n   * Severe allergy or intolerance to contrast agents, narcotics, or sedatives that cannot be managed medically\n3. Symptomatic lung disease\n4. Prior therapy with Tas-102.\n5. Contraindications to Tas-102\n\n   * Absolute neutrophil count < 1,500/μl\n   * Platelet count < 75,000/μl\n   * Allergy or intolerance to Tas-102\n6. Unresolved toxicity of greater than or equal to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Grade 2 due to prior therapies.\n7. Evidence of potential delivery of\n\n   * Greater than 30 Gy absorbed dose of radiation to the lungs during a single 90Y resin microsphere administration; or\n   * Cumulative delivery of radiation to the lungs > 50 Gy over multiple treatments.\n8. Evidence of any detectable Tc-99m macro aggregated albumin flow to the stomach or duodenum, after application of established angiographic techniques to stop such flow.\n9. Previous radiation therapy to the lungs and/or to the upper abdomen\n10. Any prior arterial liver-directed therapy, including chemoembolization, bland embolization, and 90Y radioembolization\n11. Any intervention for, or compromise of the ampulla of Vater\n12. Active uncontrolled infection. Presence of latent or medication-controlled HIV and/or viral hepatitis is allowed.\n13. Significant extrahepatic disease\n\n    * Symptomatic extrahepatic disease (including primary tumor, if unresected).\n    * Greater than 10 pulmonary nodules (each < 20 mm in diameter) or combined diameter of all pulmonary nodules > 15 cm.\n    * Peritoneal carcinomatosis\n14. Life expectancy less than 3 months\n15. Pregnant or lactating female\n16. In the investigator's judgment, any co-morbid disease or condition that would place the patient at undue risk and preclude safe use of radioembolization or Tas-102.",
