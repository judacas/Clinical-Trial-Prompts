    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Newly diagnosed, previously untreated myeloma requiring systemic chemotherapy per International Myeloma Working Group criteria:\n\n   • Patients must have received no prior chemotherapy for this disease; patients must have received no prior radiotherapy to a large area of the pelvis (more than half of the pelvis); prior steroid treatment is allowed provided treatment was not more than 2 weeks in duration and less than or equal to 160 mg dexamethasone; patients must not have received any prior treatment with bortezomib or lenalidomide\n2. Both transplant and non-transplant candidates are eligible. Transplant candidates must agree to defer transplant at time of consent.\n3. Diagnosis of symptomatic multiple myeloma as per current International Myeloma Working Group uniform criteria prior to initial treatment\n4. Monoclonal plasma cells in the BM 10% or presence of a biopsy-proven plasmacytoma\n5. Measurable disease, prior to initial treatment as indicated by one or more of the following:\n\n   * Serum M-protein greater than or equal to 1 g/dL\n   * Urine M-protein greater than or equal to 200 mg/24 hours\n   * If serum protein electrophoresis is felt to be unreliable for routine M-protein measurement, then quantitative immunoglobulin levels are acceptable\n6. Bone marrow specimen will be required at study entry; available DNA sample from pre-induction BM will be used for calibration step for Minimal Residual Disease evaluation by gene sequencing.\n7. Males and females 18 years of age or older.\n8. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1\n9.

FCBP must have 2 negative pregnancy tests (sensitivity of at least 50 mIU/mL) prior to initiating lenalidomide. The first pregnancy test must be performed within 10-14 days before and the second pregnancy test must be performed within 24 hours before lenalidomide is prescribed for Cycle 1 (prescriptions must be filled within 7 days).\n13. FCBP must agree to use 2 reliable forms of contraception simultaneously or to practice complete abstinence from heterosexual intercourse during the following time periods related to this study: 1) for at least 28 days before starting lenalidomide; 2) while participating in the study; and 3) for at least 30 days after discontinuation from the study.\n14. Male subjects must agree to use a latex condom during sexual contact with females of childbearing potential while participating in the study and for at least 90 days following discontinuation from the study even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy.\n15. All study participants in the US must be consented to and registered into the mandatory Revlimid REMS® program and be willing and able to comply with the requirements of Revlimid REMS®.\n16. Subjects must comply with pregnancy prevention and counseling\n17. Voluntary written informed consent.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
