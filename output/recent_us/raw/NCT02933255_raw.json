Appropriate documentation includes a written report or an electronic report indicating normal/negative or no clinically significant mammographic findings.\n* Subject is willing to undergo a transvaginal ultrasound (TVU) to evaluate the uterus and ovaries at screening and at week 52 end of treatment (EOT), and for subjects who are withdrawn from the study prior to completion, a TVU at the early discontinuation (ED) visit.\n* Subject is willing to undergo an endometrial biopsy at screening and at week 52 (EOT), for subjects with uterine bleeding, and for subjects who are withdrawn from the study prior to completion. The endometrial biopsy obtained at screening must be considered evaluable.\n* Subject has documentation of a normal or not clinically significant Papanicolaou (Pap) test (or equivalent cervical cytology) within the previous 12 months or at screening.\n* Subject has a negative urine pregnancy test at screening.\n* Subject has a negative serology panel (i.e., negative hepatitis B surface antigen, negative hepatitis C virus antibody and negative human immunodeficiency virus antibody screens) at screening.\n* Subject agrees not to participate in another interventional study while participating in the present study.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be FEMALE\nMust have minimum age of 40 Years\nMust have maximum age of 65 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Subject uses a prohibited therapy (strong or moderate cytochrome P450 1A2 [CYP1A2] inhibitors, hormone replacement therapy [HRT], hormonal contraceptive or any treatment for VMS [prescription, over the counter or herbal]) or is not willing to wash out and discontinue use of such drugs for the full duration of study conduct.\n* Subject has known substance abuse or alcohol addiction within 6 months of screening.\n* Subject has previous or current history of a malignant tumor, except for basal cell carcinoma.\n* Subject's systolic blood pressure is ≥ 130 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure is ≥ 80 mmHg based on the average of 2 to 3 readings, on at least 2 different occasions within the screening period.\n\n  * Subjects who do not meet these criteria may be re-assessed after initiation or review of antihypertensive measures.\n  * Subjects with a medical history of hypertension can be enrolled once they are medically clear (stable and compliant).\n* Subject has history of severe allergy, hypersensitivity or intolerance to drugs in general, including the study drug and any of its excipients.\n* Subject has an unacceptable result from the TVU assessment at screening (i.e., full length of endometrial cavity cannot be visualized or presence of a clinically significant finding).\n* Subject has an endometrial biopsy confirming presence of disordered proliferative endometrium, endometrial hyperplasia, endometrial cancer or other clinically significant findings at screening.\n* Subject has a history within the last 6 months of undiagnosed uterine bleeding.\n* Subject has a history of seizures or other convulsive disorders.\n* Subject has a medical condition or chronic disease (including history of neurological [including cognitive], hepatic, renal, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, pulmonary [e.g., moderate asthma], endocrine or gynecological disease) or malignancy that could confound interpretation of the study outcome.\n* Subject has active liver disease, jaundice or elevated liver aminotransferases (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] or aspartate aminotransferase [AST]), elevated total or direct bilirubin, elevated international normalized ratio (INR), or elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Patients with mildly elevated ALT or AST up to 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) can be enrolled if total and direct bilirubin are normal. Patients with mildly elevated ALP (up to 1.5 x ULN) can be enrolled if cholestatic liver disease is excluded and no cause other than fatty liver is diagnosed. Patients with Gilbert's syndrome with elevated total bilirubin may be enrolled as long as direct bilirubin, hemoglobin and reticulocytes are normal.\n* Subject has creatinine > 1.5 × ULN; or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula ≤ 59 mL/min per 1.73 m^2 at screening.\n* Subject has a history of suicide attempt or suicidal behavior within the last 12 months or has suicidal ideation within the last 12 months (a response of \"yes\" to question 4 or 5 on the suicidal ideation portion of the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale [C-SSRS]), or who is at significant risk to commit suicide at screening and at randomization.\n* Subject has previously been enrolled in a clinical trial with fezolinetant.\n* Subject is participating concurrently in another interventional study or participated in an interventional study within 28 days prior to screening, or received any investigational drug within 28 days or within 5 half-lives prior to screening, whichever is longer.\n* Subject is unable or unwilling to complete the study procedures.\n* Subject has any condition which makes the subject unsuitable for study participation.\n* Subject has had partial or full hysterectomy.",
