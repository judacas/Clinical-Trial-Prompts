    "exclusion_criteria": "* Current Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), Monoclonal Gammopathy of Unknown Significance (MGUS), Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) or another cancer requiring active treatment. Indolent or stable malignancies such as non-melanoma skin cancers are allowed.\n* Any active or deteriorating liver or renal disease, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C or bone marrow deficiency.\n* Any history of allergic reactions attributed to turmeric, metformin, or other compounds of similar chemical or biologic compositions.\n* History of lactic acidosis or risk factors for lactic acidosis (e.g., renal impairment, concomitant use of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as topiramate, hypoxic states such as acute congestive heart failure, excessive alcohol intake, and hepatic impairment).\n* Any other condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, might interfere with the safe conduct of the study.",
