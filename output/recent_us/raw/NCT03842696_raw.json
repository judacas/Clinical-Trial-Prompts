    "inclusion_criteria": "* Phase I\n\nPatients must have cytologically or histologically confirmed relapsed or refractory extensive-disease small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) or non-progressing ES-SCLC after first line chemotherapy, or advanced or inoperable grade I-II pulmonary NETs.\n\nPatients with tumor tissue uptake during NETSPOT® PET that is equal to or higher than that in normal hepatic tissue (grade ≥2) will be eligible. At the discretion of the principal investigator, patients with SCLC whose tumors have lower levels of uptake than liver during NETSPOT® PET may be eligible for the study.\n\nPatients must have measurable disease by RECIST criteria, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as >20 mm with conventional techniques or as >10 mm with spiral CT scan. See Section 7.1.2 for the evaluation of measurable disease.\n\nToxicities of prior therapy must be resolved to grade 1 or less as per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03 with the exception of alopecia and grade 2, prior platinum-therapy related neuropathy.\n\nPrior radiotherapy or radiosurgery (including prophylactic cranial radiation and/or thoracic radiation) must have been completed at least 2 weeks prior to randomization.\n\nECOG performance status of 0-1.\n\nAdequate organ and bone marrow function (hemoglobin > 9 g/dL; absolute neutrophil count > 1.5 x 109/L; platelet counts > 100 x 109/L; serum bilirubin < 2 x ULN; alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) < 2.5 x ULN or < 5 x ULN if liver metastases; calculated creatinine clearance > 50 mL/min).\n\nLife expectancy of at least 3 months.\n\nAge > 18 years.\n\nWomen of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must use avoid pregnancy for 23 weeks after the last dose of investigational drug. Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must avoid pregnancy for 31 weeks after the last dose of investigational drug. Women who are not of childbearing potential (i.e., who are postmenopausal or surgically sterile as well as azoospermic men) are not required to avoid pregnancy. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.\n\nWomen of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of human chorionic gonadotropic [HCG]) within 24 hours prior to the start of the study drug.\n\nWomen must not be pregnant or breastfeeding.\n\nAbility to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n\n* Phase II\n\nPatients must have cytologically or histologically confirmed ES-SCLC and must not have progressed after first line platinum-based chemotherapy regimen before randomization.\n\nPatients with tumor tissue uptake during NETSPOT® PET that is equal to or higher than that in normal hepatic tissue (grade ≥2) will be eligible. It is recommended that NETSPOT® PET be obtained before initiation of chemotherapy, but NETSPOT® PET obtained during or after completion of chemotherapy could be used for screening purpose.\n\nPatients must have measurable disease by RECIST criteria, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as >20 mm with conventional techniques or as >10 mm with spiral CT scan.

The study treatment must start within 2 weeks from randomization. For patients who receive radiotherapy (including prophylactic cranial radiation and/or thoracic radiation) after chemotherapy, the randomization must occur within 9 weeks of the last chemotherapy cycle but at least 2 weeks after completion of radiotherapy and the first dose of 177Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3-Octreotate cannot be given within 8 weeks of radiotherapy.\n\nECOG performance status of 0-1.\n\nAdequate organ and bone marrow function (hemoglobin > 9 g/dL; absolute neutrophil count > 1.5 x 109/L; platelet counts > 100 x 109/L; serum bilirubin < 2 x ULN; alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) < 2.5 x ULN or < 5 x ULN if liver metastases; calculated creatinine clearance > 50 mL/min).\n\nLife expectancy of at least 3 months.\n\nAge > 18 years.\n\nWomen of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must use avoid pregnancy for 23 weeks after the last dose of investigational drug.
