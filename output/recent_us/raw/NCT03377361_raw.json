    "official_title": "A Phase Ib Study of the Oral PARP Inhibitor Niraparib With the Intravenous PI3K Inhibitor Copanlisib for Recurrent Endometrial and Recurrent Ovarian, Primary Peritoneal, or Fallopian Tube Cancer",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Any histologically confirmed recurrent endometrial adenocarcinoma (except for carcinosarcoma), recurrent high-grade serous ovarian/primary peritoneal/fallopian tube carcinoma, or deleterious BRCA mutant recurrent ovarian/primary peritoneal/fallopian tube cancer for whom no curative option is available will be eligible. DOSE ESCALATION ONLY: For patients with ovarian cancer in the dose escalation cohort, only patients with recurrent, platinum resistant disease are eligible to enroll on study. Platinum resistance is defined as progression within 6 months from completion of platinum based therapy (the date should be calculated from the last administered dose of platinum therapy). In addition, patients in this cohort with a BRCA mutation must have also progressed after treatment with PARP inhibitor.\n* Patients may have unlimited prior chemotherapeutic regimens for management of recurrent endometrial or ovarian carcinoma. Patients who have received prior PARP inhibitors ARE allowed to participate. Patients who have received prior PI3K-pathway inhibitors ARE allowed to participate on the dose escalation phase ONLY. Patients may have progressed on prior PARP inhibitor and/or PI3K-pathway inhibitor but they may not have discontinued drug for toxicity.\n* With the exception of alopecia, peripheral neuropathy, and bone marrow parameters, any unresolved toxicities from prior chemotherapy should be no greater than Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) (version 5.0) grade 1 at the time of starting study treatment.\n* Patients should have measurable disease as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1. If no measurable disease is present, patients should have assessable disease such as pleural effusion, ascites, with CA125 Gynecological Cancer Intergroup (GCIG) criteria.\n* Patients must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.\n* The effects of niraparib and copanlisib on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to taking study treatment. Female patients and their male partners must also agree to use effective contraception when sexually active. This applies since signing of the informed consent form and 6 months (for women of child bearing potential) after the last study drug administration. A woman is considered of childbearing potential (WOCBP), i.e. fertile, following menarche and until becoming post-menopausal unless permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include but are not limited to hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy and bilateral oophorectomy. A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a post-menopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy.\n* A man is considered fertile after puberty unless permanently sterile by bilateral orchidectomy. The investigator or a designated associate must advise the patient (WOCBP or men who have not undergone bilateral orchidectomy) how to achieve highly effective birth control method. Birth control should be used from the signing of the patient consent form and for 180 days following the last dose of niraparib. Acceptable methods of birth control include:\n\n  * Two highly effective forms of contraception, defined as contraceptive methods with a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly. Patients and their sexual partners who've undergone vasectomy or tubal occlusion must also use a male condom with spermicide.\n  * Permanent sterilization, defined as hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral orchidectomy; postmenopausal, defined as a female patient or sexual partner > 45 years of age who has not menstruated for at least 12 consecutive months; total sexual abstinence.\n* It is unknown if niraparib or copanlisib are expressed in human breast milk. For this reason, women must not breast-feed while taking the study medications.\n* Absolute neutrophil count >= 1,500/mcL (within 7 days prior to entry/randomization).\n* Hemoglobin >= 9 gm/dL (within 7 days prior to entry/randomization).\n* Platelets >= 100,000/mcL (within 7 days prior to entry/randomization).\n* Total bilirubin =< 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) (within 7 days prior to entry/randomization) (< 2 x ULN for patients with Gilbert-Meulengracht syndrome or for patients with cholestasis due to compressive adenopathies of the hepatic hilum).\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) =< 2.5 x ULN unless the liver is involved with tumor, in that case, ALT/AST must be =< 5 x ULN (within 7 days prior to entry/randomization).\n* Lipase =< 1.5 x ULN (within 7 days prior to entry/randomization).\n* International normalized ratio (INR) =< 1.5 x ULN and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) =< 1.5 x ULN (within 7 days prior to entry/randomization). Prothrombin time (PT) can be used instead of INR if PTT =< 1.5 x ULN.\n* Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) >= 50% (within 7 days prior to entry/randomization).\n* Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) >= 50 mL/min/1.73 m^2 according to the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation. If not on target, the evaluation may be repeated once after at least 24 hours either according to the CKD-EPI equation or by 24 hour sampling. If the later result is within acceptable range, it may be used to fulfill the inclusion criteria instead.\n* Patients must be able to swallow and tolerate oral medications and not have gastrointestinal illnesses that would preclude absorption of niraparib (e.g. uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea; malabsorption syndrome; ulcerative disease).\n* Participants' life expectancy must be at least 3 months.\n* Patients must be able to understand and willing to sign an informed consent.\n* Patients must agree to not donate blood during the study or for 90 days after the last dose of study treatment.\n* For the expansion phase only: For the expansion phase, patients with recurrent platinum sensitive disease must progress after treatment with a platinum doublet, and patients with BRCA mutations must progress after maintenance therapy with PARP inhibitor.\n* For the expansion phase only: For the expansion phase, patients must have measurable disease accessible for biopsy.\n* For the expansion phase only: Archival specimens from the time of primary or recurrence diagnosis.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be FEMALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",

Previous corticosteroid therapy must be stopped or reduced to the allowed dose 7 days before performing the screening computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and again prior to the first study drug administration. If a patient is on chronic corticosteroid therapy, corticosteroids should be de-escalated to the maximum allowed dose before the screening. Patients may use topical or inhaled corticosteroids. - Anti-arrhythmic therapy (beta blockers or digoxin are permitted) - Use of strong inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 is prohibited from day -14 of cycle 1 until the end of study visit. Copanlisib is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4. Therefore concomitant use of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4(e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir), and inducers of CYP3A (e.g. rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, St. John's wort) are not permitted from day -14 of cycle 1 until the end of study visit.\n* For expansion phase only: Lack of accessible tumor for biopsy.",
