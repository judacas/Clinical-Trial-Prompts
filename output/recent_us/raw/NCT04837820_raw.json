    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Participant must be female ≥18 years of age, able to understand study procedures, and agree to participate in the study by providing written informed consent.\n2. Self-identify as Black. Please note that individuals who identify as Latino are eligible to participate so long as they also self-identify as Black.\n3. Participant has completed adjuvant treatment for newly diagnosed stage III or IV ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer according to the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics staging criteria.\n4. Participant must have high-grade serous or high-grade endometrioid histology.\n5. Participant must provide saliva and/or blood specimens for assessment of germline mutation(s) in the Fanconi Anemia pathway.\n6. Participant must provide formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) or fresh tumor specimen from initial cytoreductive surgery (primary debulking) or initial pre-treatment core biopsy (if neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) received; tumor obtained from interval cytoreduction acceptable if pre-treatment biopsy not obtained).\n7. Participant must have had a complete or partial clinical response to adjuvant treatment as confirmed by CT scan within 8 weeks after completion of the last dose of platinum-based chemotherapy.\n8. Participant must have recovered to ≤ Grade 1 in terms of toxicity from prior treatments.\n9. Participant must not have any known contraindication or hypersensitivity to niraparib or any of its excipients.\n10. Participants must be considered candidates for maintenance niraparib therapy by their treating physician.\n11. Participants should have adequate organ function as defined below:\n\n    * Platelets ≥ 100 platelets × 10^9/L\n    * Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL or 5.6 mmol/L\n    * Aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) ≤2.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN), <5× in patients with known liver metastases\n    * Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × ULN\n    * 1.5-3.0 × ULN may be included with appropriate starting dose adjustment to 200 mg daily.\n    * Creatinine <1.5 × ULN or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥50 mL/min by Cockcroft-Gault\n\n      * Depending on scenario, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 30-49 mL/min can be permissible.\n12. Patients with known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are allowed if they meet all the following criteria:\n\n    * Cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) ≥350/μL and viral load <400 copies/mL\n    * No history of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining opportunistic infections within 12 months before enrollment\n    * No history of HIV-associated malignancy for the past 5 years. Concurrent antiretroviral therapy as per the most current National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Adults and Adolescents with HIV started >4 weeks before study enrollment.\n13. A female participant is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant or breastfeeding and at least one of the following conditions applies:\n\n    * Is not a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP), or\n    * Is a WOCBP and using a contraceptive method that is highly effective (with a failure rate of <1% per year) from the Screening Visit through at least 180 days after the last dose of study treatment and agrees not to donate eggs (ova, oocytes) for the purpose of reproduction during this period. The Investigator should evaluate the effectiveness of the contraceptive method in relationship to the first dose of study treatment, and\n    * A WOCBP must have a negative test result from a highly sensitive pregnancy test (urine or serum, as required by local regulations) within 72 hours before treatment. Additional periodic testing should be carried out according to the protocol.\n\n    Note: The Investigator is responsible for review of medical history, menstrual history, and recent sexual activity to decrease the risk for inclusion of a woman with an early undetected pregnancy.\n14. Participant must agree to complete HRQoL and patient reported outcomes (PRO) measures throughout the study period.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be FEMALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
