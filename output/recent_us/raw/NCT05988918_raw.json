    "official_title": "PET Imaging of Thyroid Tissue Expressing Sodium-iodine Symporter Using the New Tracer 18F-tetrafluoroborate (18F-TFB)",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed thyroid carcinoma of follicular origin (including papillary and its respective variants).\n* Patients should have tumors that are radiographically evident on PET, ultrasound, CT or MRI\n* Age ≥ 18 years.\n* ECOG performance status ≤ 2 (or Karnofsky ≥60%).\n* Patients must have normal organ and bone marrow function as defined below:\n\n  * Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) > 1.5x10^9/L\n  * Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL\n  * Platelets ≥ 100 x 10^9/L\n  * Albumin ≥ 2.5 g/dL\n  * Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5x institutional ULN\n  * Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 2x institutional ULN unless it is related to the primary disease\n  * Creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL OR calculated creatinine clearance (Cockcroft-Gault formula) ≥ 50 mL/min OR 24-hour urine creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min\n* Negative pregnancy test within 7 days prior to starting the study in premenopausal women. Women of non-childbearing potential may be included without pregnancy test if they are either surgically sterile or have been postmenopausal for ≥ 1 year.\n* Fertile men and women must use an effective method of contraception during treatment and for at least 6 months after completion of treatment as directed by their physician. Effective methods of contraception are defined as those, which result in a low failure rate (i.e., less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly (for example implants, injectables, combined oral contraception or intra-uterine devices). At the discretion of the Investigator, acceptable methods of contraception may include total abstinence in cases where the lifestyle of the patient ensures compliance. (Periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.)\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* Pregnant, lactating, or breast feeding women.\n* Patients unable to follow a low iodine diet or requiring medication with high content in iodide (amiodarone).\n* Patients who received iodinated intravenous contrast as part of a radiographic procedure within 3 months of study registration. Those that have had iodinated intravenous contrast for CT imaging within this time frame may still be eligible if a urinary iodine analysis reveals that the excess iodine has been adequately cleared after the last intravenous contrast administration.\n* Unwillingness or inability to comply with study procedures.",
