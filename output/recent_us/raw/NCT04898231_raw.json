    "inclusion_criteria": "Healthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 50 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Hospitalization at the time of study recruitment.\n* Any individual less than 50 years of age. The reason that the participants ≥50 years are being excluded from this study is because those who are ≥50 years have a higher risk of being symptomatic with COVID-19 and have the potential for the greatest benefit. The disease appears to manifest differently in children and its occurrence is quite rare.\n* Only those patients tested for COVID-19 initially will be eligible to participate; therefore, anyone wanting to participate in the trial must have had a COVID-19 test prior to enrollment/participation in the study.\n* Any individual who is not capable of making independent decisions and who is considered cognitively impaired.",
    "miscellaneous_criteria": "Entry Criteria:\n\n---Adults aged 50 years of age or older who presents to MUSC or its affiliate hospitals (or associated testing centers) for COVID-19 testing during the recruitment period is eligible for participation."
