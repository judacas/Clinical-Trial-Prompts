CNS lymphoma\n   8. CAR T cell refractory\n4. Must have measurable disease as per 2014 Lugano criteria or 2018 iwCLL criteria. Participants with splenic MZL must have measurable splenomegaly on imaging or evidence of bone marrow involvement.\n\n   Prior Treatments\n5. Participants who are R/R, are intolerant to, or are considered ineligible for systemic standard of care anticancer treatments, including at least 2 prior therapies. Participants who refuse standard of care treatments may also be considered if documentation is provided that he/she has been made aware of all therapeutic options.\n6. For participants with LBCL, FL, and MCL: Have received CD19-directed CAR T cell therapy and relapsed ≥ 30 days or attained an incomplete response as the best response within 1 year after CAR T cell administration. Participants who refuse or are ineligible for CAR T cell therapy are eligible for this study. Note: during Dose Expansion, a specific cohort may be enrolled to evaluate participants who were refractory to CD19-directed CAR T cell therapy.\n\n   Health Status\n7.

Hematology: Hemoglobin ≥ 7.0 g/dL (can be transfused), absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) ≥ 300/μL, (prior to apheresis only), absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 750/μL and platelet count ≥ 50,000/μL (prior to the conditioning regimen only)\n   2. Liver: Bilirubin ≤ 1.5X upper limit of normal (ULN) (exception of bilirubin elevation due to Gilbert's syndrome 3X); aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 3X ULN\n   3. Renal: Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5X ULN or measured or calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min (prior to the conditioning regimen)\n   4. Cardiac: left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 45% (prior to the leukapheresis) Sex\n10. Female: Is a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) and using a contraceptive method that is highly effective (i.e., with a failure rate of < 1% per year), preferably with low user dependency during the intervention period and for at least 6 months after the last infusion of MT-601 and agrees not to donate eggs (i.e., ova and oocytes) for the purpose of reproduction during this period\n11. Male participants are eligible to participate if they agree to the following during the intervention period and for at least 6 months after the last infusion of MT-601:\n\nRefrain from donating sperm\n\nPLUS either:\n\nBe abstinent from intercourse as their preferred and usual lifestyle (abstinent on a long-term and persistent basis) and agree to remain abstinent OR Must agree to use a male condom AND should also be advised of the benefit for a nonpregnant female partner to use a highly effective method of contraception as a condom may break or leak\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 100 Years",
