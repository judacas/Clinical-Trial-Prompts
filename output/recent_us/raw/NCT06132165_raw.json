Discussion with cardiologist and co-principal investigator (PI) is required before starting ibrutinib\n* With minimal disease or absent disease related symptoms but anxious to start systemic therapy\n* Absence of cytopenia attributed to bone marrow (BM) infiltration\n* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) > 1000/mm^3\n* Platelet count > 100,000/mm^3\n* Patients who have bone marrow infiltration by MCL are eligible if their ANC is >= than 500 or their platelet level is >= than 50,000 /mm^3. Platelet transfusions are allowed\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) < 3 x upper limit of normal or < 5 x upper limit of normal if hepatic metastases are present\n* Serum bilirubin < 1.5 mg/dl\n* Creatinine (Cr) clearance >= 30 mL/min\n* Disease free of prior malignancies for equal to or greater than 6 months with exception of currently treated basal cell, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, carcinoma \"in situ\" of the cervix or breast, or other malignancies in remission (including prostate cancer patients in remission from radiation therapy, surgery or brachytherapy), not actively being treated.

    "exclusion_criteria": "* Any serious medical condition including but not limited to uncontrolled hypertension, arrhythmias, diabetes mellitus, active/symptomatic coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), renal failure, very painful, intolerable symptoms from splenomegaly, leukemic features, active hemorrhage, or psychiatric illness that, in the investigator's opinion, places the patient at unacceptable risk and would prevent the subject from signing the informed consent form\n* Patients with ANY of the following risk factors:\n\n  * Clinically significant disease related symptoms (including significant B symptoms) compromising the performance status to more than 1\n  * Blastoid variant histology\n  * Pleomorphic variant histology\n  * Ki-67 > 30%\n  * Bulky tumors > 5 cm\n  * Central nervous system (CNS) involvement at diagnosis\n* All patients must not have received any prior treatment for mantle cell lymphoma\n* Prior exposure to BTK inhibitor\n* Pregnant or breastfeeding females\n* Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or active with hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV).
