Life expectancy is greater than 6 months.\n5. Subject has been receiving ruxolitinib therapy, is unlikely to benefit from further ruxolitinib monotherapy in the opinion of the investigator; AND meeting the following criteria: receiving ruxolitinib >3 months prior to enrollment; AND stable dose for 8 weeks before starting therapy with CK0804\n6. Subject with evidence of evaluable residual burden of disease following ruxolitinib monotherapy treatment, consisting of:\n\n   * presence of grade ≥2 anemia or thrombocytopenia or neutropenia, OR\n   * presence of disease-related symptoms, as determined by a Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form Total Symptom Score (MPN SAF TSS) score of ≥10 points, OR\n   * documented splenomegaly of at least 5 cm below the costal margin as measured by physical examination or splenomegaly as documented by ultrasound or MRI.\n7. Willingness to avoid pregnancy or fathering children based on the criteria below\n\n   * Men must agree to take appropriate precautions to avoid fathering children (with at least 99% certainty) from screening through 90 days after the last study treatment dose and must refrain from donating sperm during this period. Permitted methods that are at least 99% effective in preventing should be communicated to the participants and their understanding confirmed.\n   * Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening before the first dose (within 3 days of the first study treatment dose) and must agree to take appropriate precautions to avoid pregnancy (with at least 99% certainty) from screening through the safety follow-up visit and must not donate oocytes during this period. Permitted methods that are at least 99% effective in preventing pregnancy should be communicated to the participants and their understanding confirmed,\n   * Women of nonchildbearing potential (ie, surgically sterile with a hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy OR ≥ 12 months of amenorrhea and at least 50 years of age) are eligible.\n8.

Undergone any prior allogenic or autologous stem cell transplantation or a candidate for such transplantation.\n3. Received chemotherapy, immunomodulatory drug therapy, immunosuppressive therapy, biological therapy, endocrine therapy, targeted therapy, antibody or hypomethylating agent to treat the participant's disease, with the exception of ruxolitinib, within 5 half-lives or 28 days (whichever is shorter) before the first dose of study treatment.\n4. Participant has received splenic irradiation within the past 6 months.\n5.

Any condition that would, in the investigator's judgment, interfere with full participation in the study, including administration of study treatment and attending required study visits; pose a significant risk to the participant; or interfere with interpretation of study data.\n9. Participants with laboratory values at screening as defined\n\n   * Platelets < 50 × 10^9/L without the assistance of growth factors, thrombopoietic factors, or platelet transfusions\n   * ANC < 0.5 × 10^9/L\n   * ALT ≥ 2.5 × ULN\n   * AST ≥ 2.5 × ULN\n   * Direct Bilirubin > 2.0 × ULN\n   * ALP ≥ 3 × ULN\n   * Creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min according to Cockcroft-Gault formula.\n10.
