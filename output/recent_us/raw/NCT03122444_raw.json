Treatment naïve patients may be enrolled if they have refused standard systemic treatment.

If the urine pregnancy test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required.\n\n  † A woman of childbearing potential is a sexually mature female who: has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e. has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months).\n* Male patients with WOCBP partners and female patients of childbearing potential must be willing to use an adequate method of contraception as outlined in Section 11.9, for the course of the study through 7 months (male participants) or 5 months (female participants) after the last dose of study medication.\n\nNote: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and preferred contraception for the patient.\n\n* Hematological\n\n  * Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1,500 /mcL\n  * Platelets ≥100,000 / mcL\n  * Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL or ≥5.6 mmol/L\n* Renal\n\n  * Serum creatinine OR Measured or calculateda creatinine clearance ≤1.5 X upper limit of normal (ULN) OR ≥60 mL/min for patient with creatinine levels > 1.5 X institutional ULN (GFR can also be used in place of creatinine or CrCl) Hepatic\n  * Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X ULN OR Direct bilirubin ≤ ULN for patients with total bilirubin levels > 1.5 ULN\n  * AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 X ULN OR ≤ 5 X ULN for patients with liver metastases\n  * Albumin ≥ 2.5 mg/dL Coagulation\n  * International Normalized Ratio [34] or Prothrombin Time [35]≤1.5 X ULN unless patient is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants\n  * Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) ≤1.5 X ULN unless patient is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants aCreatinine clearance should be calculated per institutional standard.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 12 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* History of unstable or deteriorating cardiac disease within the previous 6 months prior to screening including but not limited to the following:\n\n  * Unstable angina or myocardial infarction.\n  * Congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] Class III or IV).\n  * Uncontrolled clinically significant arrhythmias.\n* Evidence of clinically significant interstitial lung disease or has known history of, or any evidence of active, non-infectious pneumonitis. .\n* Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Patients with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided:\n\n  * No current brain metastasis lesion greated than 2 cm. Patients with prior metastasis lesions greater than 2 cm that have been removed by surgical and/or radiotherapy may be enrolled if the lesion has been stable since surgery or radiotherapy.\n  * No new or progressing brain metastatis of any size\n  * No stereotactic radiation or craniotomy within 4 weeks of Cycle 1 Day 1\n  * They are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least four weeks prior to the first dose of trial treatment\n  * No clinically signifigant symptoms secondary to brain metastases(This exception does not include carcinomatous meningitis which is excluded regardless of clinical stability.)\n* Evidence of clinically significant immunosuppression such as the following:\n\n  * Primary immunodeficiency state such as Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Disease\n  * Concurrent opportunistic infection\n  * Receiving systemic immunosuppressive therapy (> 2 weeks) including oral steroid doses > 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent within 2 months prior to enrollment. (Steroids for pre-medication for imaging studies are allowed.)\n* History or evidence of symptomatic autoimmune disease (e.g., pneumonitis, glomerulonephritis, vasculitis, or other), or history of active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment (i.e., use of corticosteroids, immunosuppressive drugs or biological agents used for treatment of autoimmune diseases) in past 2 years prior to enrollment.
