    "exclusion_criteria": "* Is currently participating in or has participated in a study of an investigational agent or using an investigational device within 4 weeks of the first dose of treatment.\n* Chemotherapy, monoclonal antibody, targeted small molecule therapy, within 4 weeks prior to dose #1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to a previously administered agent (excluding alopecia or toxicity not anticipated to interfere with planned treatment on study).\n* Known or suspected MSI-H CRC.\n* Any prior Grade ≥3 immune-related adverse event (irAE) while receiving any previous immunotherapy agent, or any unresolved irAE >Grade 1, including anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-CD137, anti-CTLA-4 antibody or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation or checkpoint pathways, except for endocrinopathies and asymptomatic amylase/lipase.\n* If subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention per clinical discretion of the investigator prior to starting therapy.\n* Concurrent active malignancy that requires systemic treatment.\n* Known CNS metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis.
