    "official_title": "Simulation-Based Caregiving Skills Training for Family Members of High Grade Glioma Patients",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* FCGs (e.g., spouse/partner, parent, adult child) of patients diagnosed with HGG receiving any form of cancer treatment (including palliative intent) at MDACC.\n* Patients must have a Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) of 100 to 50. If the patient's Karnofsky Performance Status drops below 50 both patient and caregiver will be removed from the study.\n* Both FCGs and patients must be willing to participate and (1) â‰¥18 years old and able to (2) read and speak English and (3) provide informed consent.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* FCGs who regularly participate in psychotherapy with a licensed professional (self-reported).\n* Patients with cognitive impairment that would impede ability to complete self-report surveys as documented in the medical record.\n* Children under the age of 18 will not be included in this trial. First and foremost, it is unlikely that a person under the age 18 is diagnosed with an HGG.\n* Childhood brain tumors tend to be diagnosed in infancy and the caregiving and symptom management needs are vastly different than in the adult patient population. Additionally, the assessment tools are not validated for minors.\n* While pregnant caregivers (self-reported) are study eligible, we will also exclude pregnant patients (medical notes). It is unlikely that patients diagnosed with an HGG will be pregnant. Moreover, the current caregiver intervention is not designed to address the care needs of pregnant cancer patients.",
