If they are of childbearing potential, agree to practice 1 effective methods of contraception and 1 additional effective (barrier) method, at the same time, from the time of signing the informed consent through 90 days (or longer as mandated by local labeling [eg, USPI, SmPC, etc,]) after the last dose of study drug, OR\n   4. Agree to practice true abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. (Periodic abstinence [eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods], withdrawal, spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea are not acceptable methods of contraception. Female and male condoms should not be used together.)\n8. Screening clinical laboratory values as specified below:\n\n   1.

Hepatic: total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN), transaminases (aspartate aminotransferase/serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase-AST/SGOT and alanine aminotransferase/serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase-ALT/SGPT) ≤ 2.5 x ULN (≤ 5 x ULN if liver metastases are present);\n   3. Renal: creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min based either on cockroft-Gault estimate or based on urine collection (12 or 24 hour);\n   4. Metabolic: Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c)<7.0%, fasting serum glucose (≤ 130 mg/dL) and fasting triglycerides ≤ 300 mg/dL\n9. Ability to swallow oral medications.\n10. Must be able to fast for glucose monitoring throughout PIKTOR treatment.\n11. Patients who have a history of brain metastasis are eligible for the study provided that all the following criteria are met:\n\n    1. Brain metastases which have been treated\n    2. No evidence of disease progression for ≥2 months before the first dose of study drug.\n    3. No hemorrhage after treatment\n    4. Off-treatment with dexamethasone for 3 weeks before administration of the first dose of PIKTOR\n    5. No ongoing requirement for dexamethasone or anti-epileptic drugs\n12. Voluntary written consent must be given before performance of any study related procedure not part of standard medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn by the patient at any time without prejudice to future medical care.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be FEMALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "Patients meeting any of the following exclusion criteria are not to be enrolled in the study:\n\n1. Leptomeningeal disease that is symptomatic or cytology-proven.\n2. Other clinically significant co-morbidities, such as uncontrolled pulmonary disease, active central nervous system disease, active infection, or any other condition that could compromise the patient's participation in the study.\n3. Known human immunodeficiency virus infection.\n4. Known hepatitis B surface antigen-positive, or known or suspected active hepatitis C infection.\n5. Any serious medical or psychiatric illness that could, in the investigator's opinion, potentially interfere with the completion of treatment according to this protocol.\n6. Diagnosed or treated for another malignancy within 2 years before administration of the first dose of study drug, or previously diagnosed with another malignancy and have any evidence of residual disease. Patients with non-melanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of any type are not excluded if they have undergone complete resection.\n7. Breast feeding or pregnant.\n8. Treatment with any investigational products within 30 days before the first dose of study drug\n9. Previous treatment with PI3K, AKT, dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors, TORC1/2 inhibitors or TORC1 inhibitors.\n10. Manifestations of malabsorption due to prior gastrointestinal (GI) surgery, GI disease, or for an unknown reason that may alter the absorption of PIKTOR. In addition, patients with enteric stomata are also excluded.\n11. History of any of the following within the last 6 months before administration of the first dose of the drug:\n\n    1. Ischemic myocardial event, including angina requiring therapy and artery revascularization procedures\n    2. Ischemic cerebrovascular event, including transient ischemic attack and artery revascularization procedures\n    3. Requirement for inotropic support (excluding digoxin) or serious (uncontrolled) cardiac arrhythmia (including atrial flutter/fibrillation, ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia)\n    4. Placement of a pacemaker for control of rhythm\n    5. New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV heart failure f. Pulmonary embolism\n12. Significant active cardiovascular or pulmonary disease including:\n\n    1. Uncontrolled hypertension (ie, systolic blood pressure >180 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure > 100 mm Hg).
