If on anticoagulant therapy: PT must be within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants\n* If not receiving anticoagulants: activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) =< 1.5 x ULN. If on anticoagulant therapy: aPTT must be within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants\n* Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP): negative urine or serum pregnancy test. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required\n* Agreement by females and males of childbearing potential* to use an effective method of birth control or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course of the study through at least 12 months after the last dose of polatuzumab vedotin or rituximab for women, at least 5 months following the last dose of polatuzumab vedotin or 3 months following the last dose of rituximab for men, and at least 6 months following the last dose of ifosfamide, carboplatin, or etoposide for both women and men\n\n  * Childbearing potential defined as not being surgically sterilized (men and women) or have not been free from menses for > 1 year (women only)\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Patients who are not hematopoietic stem cell transplant candidates are excluded\n* Prior solid organ transplantation\n* Systemic steroid therapy or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy for lymphoma symptom control must be tapered down to =< 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent. Exceptions are:\n\n  * Inhaled or topical steroids\n  * Adrenal replacement doses > 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents in the absence of active autoimmune disease\n* Peripheral neuropathy >= grade 2 or demyelinating form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease\n* Known active central nervous system (CNS) involvement by lymphoma, including leptomeningeal involvement\n* Active infection requiring systemic therapy\n* Other active malignancy requiring therapy.

Patients with past HBV infection (defined as negative hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] and positive hepatitis B core antibody [HBcAb]) are eligible if HBV DNA is undetectable. Patients who are positive for HCV antibody are eligible if polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is negative for HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA).
