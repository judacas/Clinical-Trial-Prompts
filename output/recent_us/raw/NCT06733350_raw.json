    "exclusion_criteria": "* Received more than 1 prior treatment (combined modality therapy represents 1 treatment) for Hodgkin Lymphoma\n* Known pregnancy or breast-feeding.\n\n  * Breast-feeding should be discontinued prior to treatment initiation.\n* Medical illness unrelated to Hodgkin's Lymphoma, which, in the opinion of the attending physician and/or principal investigator, makes participation in this study inappropriate.\n* Has received prior radiotherapy within 2 weeks of start of study treatment.
