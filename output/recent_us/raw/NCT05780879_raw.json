To be eligible for this trial, participants should be class 2B or better.\n* Participants must be willing to undergo a pre-treatment fresh tumor biopsy.\n* Participants must be willing to undergo an on-treatment tumor biopsy (if medically feasible).\n* Participants must have archival tissue available for analysis, which will be used for correlative studies if a pretreatment biopsy reveals necrotic tissue.\n\n  * The effects of domvanalimab, zimberelimab, and APX005M on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (See Section 5.6) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 4 months after completion of domvanalimab, zimberelimab, or APX005M administration.\n  * Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP), defined as not surgically sterilized and between menarche and 1-year post menopause, must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to the first dose of investigational therapies and a negative urine (or serum) pregnancy test within 3 days prior to the first dose of investigational therapies.\n  * WOCBP must agree to use highly effective methods of contraception from the time of consent, through the duration of study treatment, and 5 months after the last dose of investigational therapies.\n  * Male participants with WOCBP sexual partners must agree to use highly effective methods of contraception, and to refrain from donating sperm from the time of consent through the duration of study treatment and 7 months after the last dose of investigational therapies. Contraceptive requirements may be extended depending on local regulatory requirements.\n  * Female participants must not be breast feeding and must not breast-feed a baby while on treatment and for up to 7 months after the last dose of investigational therapies.\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n* Willing and able to comply with the requirements and restrictions in this protocol.\n* Eligibility Criteria for Stage 2 (Crossover Stage)\n\n  * Patients must meet all of the criteria used for Stage 1.\n  * Patients allocated to the control arm (Arm B) during Stage 1 have the ability to initiate Stage 2 treatment within 4 weeks after experiencing disease progression per RECIST v1.1 while receiving control treatment\n* Availability of a tumor specimen from on-treatment biopsy during Expansion Phase. If this is not available, willingness to undergo biopsy prior to initiation of Crossover Phase.\n* Exclusion Criteria (for both Stage 1 and Stage 2)\n* Patients who have evidence of disease progression on FOLFIRINOX.\n* Participants who have had cytotoxic chemotherapy, radiotherapy, within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study medication or those who have not recovered to ≤ CTCAE Grade 1 or baseline from adverse events due to agents administered more than 2 weeks earlier. Exceptions include alopecia of any grade and Grade ≤ 2 peripheral neuropathy.\n* Participants who have received any other investigational agents for pancreatic cancer.\n* History of severe allergic, anaphylactic, or other hypersensitivity reactions to chimeric or humanized antibodies, or allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to domvanalimab, zimberelimab, APX005M, or other agents used in study.\n* Prior treatment with any of the protocol-specified study treatments, with the exception of chemotherapy.\n* Prior treatment with T-cell co-stimulating or immune checkpoint blockade therapies (including anti-CTLA-4, anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-TIGIT, and CD40 agonist therapeutic antibodies)\n* Patients with endocrine or acinar pancreatic carcinoma are not eligible for the study.\n* Known dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency.\n* Known germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation(s).\n* Participants who have undergone major surgery 28 days prior to initiating protocol therapy.

Placement of central venous access catheter (e.g., port or similar) is not considered a major surgical procedure.\n* Participants must not have a history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B (HBV), or hepatitis C (HCV), except for the following:\n\n  * Participants with anti-HepB core antibody but with undetectable HepB virus deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and negative for HepB surface antigen\n  * Participants with resolved or treated hepatitis C virus (HCV) (i.e., HCV antibody positive but undetectable HCV RNA)\n* Participants must not have a history of primary immunodeficiency.\n* Active autoimmune disease, history of autoimmune disease, or concurrent administration of immune suppressive medications. Participants must not have a known or suspected history of an autoimmune disorder within 3 years of the first dose of investigational agent, including but not limited to: systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, Wegner syndrome, Hashimoto syndrome, sarcoidosis, or autoimmune hepatitis.
