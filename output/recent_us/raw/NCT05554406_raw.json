    "official_title": "An Adaptive, Open-Label, Randomized Phase 2 Study of Abemaciclib as a Monotherapy and in Combination With Other Agents Versus Choice of Standard of Care (Gemcitabine or Capecitabine) in Patients With Previously Treated Metastatic Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Histological or cytological diagnosis of ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.\n* Metastatic disease with documented disease progression following previous treatment with at least one, but no more than 2 prior therapies, with one of the prior therapies having been either gemcitabine-based or fluoropyrimidine-based therapy. Neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant therapies for localized resectable or unresectable PDAC each count as a line of therapy if multiagent chemotherapy regimens were administered (and neoadjuvant regimen was different than adjuvant regimen) and if the participant progressed with metastatic disease while taking or within 6 months of completion of (neo)adjuvant therapy.\n* Measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1.\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.\n* Participant for whom treatment with monotherapy chemotherapy such as gemcitabine or capecitabine is a reasonable choice.\n* Discontinued all prior treatment for cancer at least 14 days prior to initial dose of study treatment.\n* Adequate organ function.\n\n  * allow alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) up to 5x upper limit of normal (ULN) if liver metastases.\n  * allow bilirubin up to 2.5 times ULN if elevation is not associated with other signs of liver toxicity or can be explained by mechanical obstruction - requires clinical research physician approval.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Have a personal history of any of the following conditions: syncope of either unexplained or cardiovascular etiology, ventricular arrhythmia (including but not limited to ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation), or sudden cardiac arrest. Exception: Participants with controlled atrial fibrillation for >30 days prior to study treatment initiation are eligible.\n* Have insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus are eligible if adequate control of blood glucose level is obtained by oral anti-diabetics as documented by hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) <7%.\n* Have symptomatic central nervous system metastasis. Screening of asymptomatic participants is not required for enrollment.\n* Have had major surgery within 7 days prior to initiation of study drug to allow for postoperative healing of the surgical wound and site(s).\n* Have previously received treatment with any cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4 and 6 inhibitor or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and/or mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor or have a known hypersensitivity to any component of the investigational products in this study.\n* Have a known hypersensitivity to investigator's choice of standard of care (gemcitabine or capecitabine).",
