    "exclusion_criteria": "* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, active uncontrolled infection, known positive for active infectious hepatitis, type A, B or C (past infection allowed), or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements; Note: ongoing infection controlled on antibiotics/antifungal/antiviral medications are allowed\n* Any of the following prior therapies:\n\n  * Cytotoxic chemotherapy =<14 days prior to registration\n  * Immunotherapy =< 14 days prior to registration\n  * Biologic therapy (i.e. antibody therapies) =< 14 days prior to registration\n  * Radiation therapy =<14 days prior to registration\n  * Targeted therapies (i.e. kinase inhibitors, =< 7 days or 5 half-life's whichever is shorter)\n\n    â€¢ For steroids or other non-cytotoxics given for blast count control, patient must be off for > 24 hours (hrs) before starting therapy; NOTE: hydroxyurea (HU) is allowed for blast count control throughout study\n  * Receiving any other investigational agent which would be considered as a treatment for the primary neoplasm =< 14 days prior to registration\n* Active uncontrolled central nervous system (CNS) leukemia; NOTE: positive (cyto)pathology is allowed and patient can receive intrathecal chemotherapy\n* Immunocompromised patients and patients known to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive and currently receiving antiretroviral therapy; NOTE: patients known to be HIV positive, but without clinical evidence of an immunocompromised state, are eligible for this trial\n* Any previous treatment with AZD1775 or allergic reactions to excipients of AZD1775\n* Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL, M3) unless failed regimens that included tretinoin, arsenic trioxide, anthracyclines and cytarabine and currently NOT candidates for stem cell transplantation\n* Major surgery =< 28 days prior to registration\n* Clinically significant heart disease, including the following:\n\n  * Active severe angina pectoris within 3 months prior to registration\n  * Acute myocardial infarction within 3 months prior to registration\n  * New York Heart Association classification IV cardiovascular disease or symptomatic class III disease\n\n    * Note: patients with any of the above may be allowed after discussion amongst the investigators including the principal investigator\n* Any of the following:\n\n  * Pregnant women\n  * Nursing women\n  * Men or women of childbearing potential who are unwilling to employ adequate contraception\n* Subject has had prescription or non-prescription drugs or other products known to be sensitive cytochrome P450 family 3, subfamily A, polypeptide 4 (CYP3A4) substrates or CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, or to be moderate to strong inhibitors/inducers of CYP3A4 which cannot be discontinued two weeks prior (alternatively 5 half lives if T1/2 is known) prior to day 1 of dosing and withheld throughout the study until 2 weeks after the last dose of study drug\n\n  * NOTE: co-administration of aprepitant or fosaprepitant during this study is prohibited\n  * Note: individual drugs exerting CYP interactions may be continued on a case by case basis if felt essential for patient management, after discussions and discretion of the treating physician\n  * The preferred azole anti-fungal medication is fluconazole (alternatively posaconazole) which can be given during treatment with AZD1775 at the treating physician's discretion, however with dose reductions of AZD1775 by 25-75% (i.e. from AZD1775 200mg to 150 or 100mg)\n* Patients may not be on an inhibitor of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP)\n\n  * NOTE: AZD1775 is an inhibitor of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP); the use of statins including atorvastatin which are substrates for BCRP are therefore prohibited and patients should be moved on to non-BCRP alternatives\n* Not willing to avoid grapefruit, grapefruit juices, grapefruit hybrids, Seville oranges, pummelos, and exotic citrus fruits from 7 days prior to the dose of study medication and during the entire study; NOTE: orange juice is allowed\n* Corrected QT interval (QTc) > 470 msec (as calculated per institutional standards) at study entry or congenital long QT syndrome",
