If TnT or TnI levels are between >1 to 2 × ULN within 24 hours, the participant must undergo a cardiology consultation and cardiac evaluation and be considered for treatment, based on a favorable benefit/risk assessment by the Investigator. When repeat levels within 24 hours are not available, a repeat test should be conducted as soon as possible. If TnT or TnI repeat levels beyond 24 hours are < 2 × ULN, the participant must undergo a cardiology consultation and cardiac evaluation and be considered for treatment, based on a favorable benefit-risk assessment by the Investigator.\n* Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) assessment with documented LVEF < 50% by either transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) or multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan (TTE preferred test) within 6 months prior to start of study treatment.\n* Participants with a history of myocarditis and/or current diagnosis of myocarditis, regardless of etiology.\n* Participants must not have a history of allergy or hypersensitivity to study intervention components.",
