    "exclusion_criteria": "1.

Presence of any psychiatric disorder that will affect ability to participate in study.\n2. Diabetes other than T1D\n3. Chronic illness known to affect glucose metabolism (e.g. Cushing syndrome, polycystic ovarian disorder, cystic fibrosis) or taking medications that affect glucose metabolism (e.g. steroids, metformin)\n4. Inability to swallow pills\n5. Psychiatric impairment or current use of anti-psychotic medication\n6. Any condition that, in the investigator's opinion, may compromise study participation or may confound the interpretation of the study results.\n7. Neutropenia (< 1,500 neutrophils/μL)\n8.
