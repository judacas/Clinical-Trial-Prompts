Female participants of childbearing potential who are sexually active with a non-sterilized male partner must agree to use at least 1 highly effective method of contraception from the time of screening and must agree to continue using such precautions for 120 days after the last dose of study drug for participants who receive soquelitinib, or 6 months after the last dose for participants who receive either belinostat or pralatrexate.\n10.
