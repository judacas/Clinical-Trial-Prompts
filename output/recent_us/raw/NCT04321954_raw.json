    "inclusion_criteria": "* Patients with histologically proven prostate adenocarcinoma.\n* Planned prostatectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection.\n* Unfavorable intermediate-risk, high-risk, or very high-risk disease defined by NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2023 and previous versions.\n* Male aged greater than or equal to 18 years.\n* Able to understand and provide signed written informed consent.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be MALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",

If Barium contrast is administered this should be cleared before the PET scan.\n* Patients who are administered any high energy (greater than 300 KeV) gamma emitting radioisotopes within five (5) physical half-lives prior to copper Cu 64 PSMA I&T administration.\n* Patients with known hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the excipients of the IP.\n* Patients who had a PSMA PET scan as part of their standard medical care within 90 days prior to enrollment.",
