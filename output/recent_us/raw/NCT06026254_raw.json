    "exclusion_criteria": "Disease Related\n\n* Primary brain tumor, untreated or symptomatic brain metastases and leptomeningeal disease.\n\nOther Medical Conditions\n\n* History of other malignancy within the past 2 years, with the following exception[s]:\n\n  * Malignancy treated with curative intent and with no known active disease present for ≥ 3 years before enrollment and felt to be at low risk for recurrence by the treating physician.\n  * Adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer or lentigo maligna without evidence of disease.\n  * Adequately treated cervical carcinoma in situ without evidence of disease.\n  * Adequately treated breast ductal carcinoma in situ without evidence of disease.\n  * Prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia without evidence of prostate cancer.\n  * Adequately treated urothelial papillary noninvasive carcinoma or carcinoma in situ.\n* Participants with NSCLC squamous cell carcinoma (Part 1), MSLN negative NSCLC squamous cell carcinoma (Part 2), or MSLN negative NSCLC adenocarcinoma (Part 2) once the participant has been screened for MSLN expression.\n* Participants with sarcomatoid mesothelioma and small cell lung cancer will be excluded from both the Dose Exploration (Part 1) and Dose Expansion (Part 2) parts of the study.\n* History of solid organ transplantation.\n* Major surgery within 28 days of study day 1.\n\nPrior/Concomitant Therapy\n\n* Anti-tumor therapy (radiotherapy, chemotherapy, antibody therapy, molecular targeted therapy, or investigational agent) within 21 days prior to study day 1.\n* Treatment with a checkpoint inhibitor within 9 weeks prior to study day 1.\n* Live vaccine therapy within 4 weeks prior to study drug administration.\n* Current treatment or within 14 days of day 1 with immunosuppressive corticosteroid defined as > 10 mg prednisone daily or equivalent. Steroids with no minimal systemic effect (such as topical or inhalation) are permitted.\n\nPrior/Concurrent Clinical Study Experience\n\n* Currently receiving treatment in another investigational device or drug study, or less than 21 days prior to study day 1 since ending treatment on another investigational device or drug study(ies).\n* Evidence of active or radiological sequelae of non-infectious pneumonitis.\n* History of any immune-related colitis. Infectious colitis is allowed if evidence of adequate treatment and clinical recovery exists and at least 3 months interval observed since diagnosis of colitis.\n* History of allergic reactions or acute hypersensitivity reaction to antibody therapies.\n* Positive/non-negative test results for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).\n* Hepatitis B and C based on the following results:\n\n  * Positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) (indicative of chronic hepatitis B or recent acute hepatitis B)\n  * Negative HBsAG and positive for hepatitis B core antibody: hepatitis B virus DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is necessary. Detectable hepatitis B virus DNA suggests occult hepatitis B.\n  * Positive hepatitis C virus antibody (HCVAb): hepatitis C virus RNA by PCR is necessary. Detectable hepatitis C virus RNA suggests chronic hepatitis C.\n* Active infection requiring oral or intravenous therapy.\n* Active or history of any autoimmune disease or immunodeficiencies.
