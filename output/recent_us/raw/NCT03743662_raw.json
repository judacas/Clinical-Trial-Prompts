Must have received at least one line of prior systemic therapy for their lymphoma; participants with anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) must have received prior brentuximab unless there was a contraindication to brentuximab.\n4. Evaluable disease defined by at least one lesion that can be measured in least 1 dimension and measures at least 1.5 cm in its longest dimension by CT or PET scan, or bone/bone marrow involvement, or skin involvement.\n5. No circulating CD5+ malignant cells identified by peripheral blood flow cytometry must be present.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
