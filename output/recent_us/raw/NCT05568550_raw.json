N1 by PSMA allowed with up to 3 LNs each ≤1 cm. If there is no frank bone disease, but PSMA scan and CT scan are in discordance, then investigators will discuss.\n* Initial prostate biopsy, obtained within 3 months of enrollment, is available for central pathologic review, and is confirmed to show at least 3 positive cores (at least 1 core with at least 50% disease involvement with ≥4+3=7 disease) and a Gleason sum of ≥8 (or 4+3=7 with at least 1 additional high-risk feature such as PSA>20 or cT3)\n* Radical prostatectomy has been scheduled\n* Age ≥18 years\n* ECOG performance status 0-1, or Karnofsky score ≥ 70% (see Appendix A)\n* Adequate bone marrow, hepatic, and renal function:\n\n  * WBC >3,000 cells/mm3\n  * ANC >1,500 cells/mm3\n  * Hemoglobin >9.0 g/dL\n  * Platelet count >100,000 cells/mm3\n  * Serum creatinine <1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN)\n  * Serum bilirubin <1.5 × ULN\n  * ALT <3 × ULN\n  * AST <3 × ULN\n  * Alkaline phosphatase <3 × ULN\n* The etiology of abnormal bilirubin and transaminase levels should be evaluated prior to study entry.\n* Willingness to provide written informed consent and HIPAA authorization for the release of personal health information, and the ability to comply with the study requirements (note: HIPAA authorization will be included in the informed consent)\n* Willingness to use barrier contraception from the time of first dose of Enoblituzumab (MGA271) until the time of prostatectomy.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be MALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "To be eligible for this study, patients should not meet any of the following criteria:\n\n* Presence of known lymph node involvement on CT (N1 by PSMA allowed with up to 3 LNs each ≤1 cm) or distant metastases by CT and NM bone scan\n* Other histologic types of prostate cancers such as ductal, sarcomatous, lymphoma, small cell, and neuroendocrine tumors\n* Prior radiation therapy, hormonal therapy, biologic therapy, or chemotherapy for prostate cancer\n* Prior immunotherapy/vaccine therapy for prostate cancer\n* Prior use of experimental agents for prostate cancer\n* Concomitant treatment with other hormonal therapy or 5α-reductase inhibitors\n* Current use of systemic corticosteroids or use of systemic corticosteroids within 4 weeks of enrollment (inhaled corticosteroids for asthma or COPD are permitted as are other non-systemic steroids such as topical corticosteroids)\n* History or presence of autoimmune disease requiring systemic immunosuppression (including but not limited to: inflammatory bowel disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, vasculitis, rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, multiple sclerosis, hemolytic anemia, Sjögren syndrome, and sarcoidosis)\n* History of malignancy within the last 3 years, with the exception of non-melanoma skin cancers and superficial bladder cancer\n* Uncontrolled major active infectious, cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematologic, or psychiatric illnesses that would make the patient a poor study candidate\n* Known prior or current history of HIV and/or hepatitis B/C, with the exception of patients who have been successfully treated for hepatitis B/C (i.e. documented confirmation of cure at least 6 months after initial treatment).",
