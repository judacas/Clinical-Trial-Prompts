Willing to refrain from using lotions, creams, etc. during the treatment period;\n8. Subjects with adequate organ and bone marrow function as defined below:\n\n   * ANC ≥ 1,500/µl\n   * Hemoglobin ≥ 9.5 grams/dL\n   * Platelets ≥ 75,000/µl\n   * AST (aspartate transaminase or SGOT)/ALT (alanine aminotransferase or SGPT) ≤ 3.0 x ULN and total bilirubin ≤ 2.0 x ULN with no evidence of cholestasis\n   * Creatinine ≤ 1.5x ULN;\n9.

Last dose of any systemic taxane cytotoxic chemotherapy completed at least 4 weeks prior to Day 1\n10. Willing to use appropriate birth control for patients of child-bearing potential;\n11. Abstinence from all manner of physical contact near the treatment area during and up to 2 weeks after the treatment phase.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Open or ulcerated wound(s) extending through the dermis within the treatment area;\n2.
