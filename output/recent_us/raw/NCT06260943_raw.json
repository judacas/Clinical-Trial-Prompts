Nonsterile males must be willing to use a highly effective method of birth control for the duration of the study treatment period and for ≥ 90 days after the last dose of BGB-26808, or for ≥ 120 days after the last dose of tislelizumab, or for ≥ 180 days after the last dose of chemotherapy.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",

Active leptomeningeal disease or uncontrolled, untreated brain metastasis.\n5. Active autoimmune diseases or history of autoimmune diseases that may relapse\n6. Any malignancy ≤ 3 years before the first dose of study treatment(s) except for the specific cancer under investigation in this study and any locally recurring cancer that has been treated with curative intent (eg, resected basal or squamous cell skin cancer, superficial bladder cancer, or carcinoma in situ of the cervix or breast).\n7. Any condition that required systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (> 10 mg daily of prednisone or equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medication ≤ 14 days before the first dose of study treatment(s).\n8. History of interstitial lung disease, noninfectious pneumonitis, or uncontrolled lung diseases including pulmonary fibrosis, acute lung diseases.\n9. Uncontrolled diabetes.\n10.
