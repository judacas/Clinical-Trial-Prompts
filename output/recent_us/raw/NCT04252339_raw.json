    "inclusion_criteria": "* Has a histologically-confirmed diagnosis of endometrial carcinoma or carcinosarcoma.\n* Has radiographically evaluable disease, either measurable or nonmeasurable per response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST 1.1), as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR).\n* Has received prior platinum-based chemotherapy and anti-programmed cell death 1 protein (PD-1)/anti- programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) therapy, either separately or in combination.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be FEMALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Has neuroendocrine tumors or endometrial sarcoma, including stromal sarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, adenosarcoma, or other types of pure sarcomas\n* Has a history of documented severe dry eye syndrome, severe Meibomian gland disease and/or blepharitis, or severe corneal disease that prevents/delays corneal healing\n* Has active inflammatory bowel disease requiring immunosuppressive medication or previous history of inflammatory bowel disease\n* Has had a recurrence of endometrial carcinoma or carcinosarcoma more than >12 months after completing platinum-based therapy administered in the curative-intent setting without any additional platinum-based therapy received in the recurrent setting. Note: 1) If Immunotherapy-based treatment is administered in the recurrent setting, then platinum rechallenge is not required, regardless of the duration of the platinum-free interval from time of adjuvant therapy 2) For Stage IVb disease, treatment that includes gynecological surgery followed by a platinum-based regimen is NOT considered curative-intent per protocol and does not require platinum rechallenge in the recurrent setting, regardless of the duration of the platinum-free interval\n* Has received more than 3 prior lines of therapy for endometrial carcinoma or carcinosarcoma\n* Has history of (noninfectious) pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease that required steroids or has current pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease\n* Has received prior treatment with single-agent nonplatinum based chemotherapy in the third-line setting\n* Has received prior treatment with a trophoblast cell surface antigen 2 (TROP2)-targeted antibody drug conjugate (ADC) (eg, sacituzumab govitecan)\n* Has received prior treatment with a topoisomerase I inhibitor-containing ADC (eg, sacituzumab govitecan or fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki)\n* Has previously received both single-agent paclitaxel and single-agent doxorubicin in any setting for prior treatment of endometrial cancer",
