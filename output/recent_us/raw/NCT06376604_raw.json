Subjects who are taking QT-prolonging drugs that are known to cause Torsades de Pointes (TdP) (See Appendix 17 for the list of medications that are associated with TdP). In the event a prohibited medication might cause TdP, the PI must first determine if the risk to benefit is in favor of the subject and then discuss with the Medical Monitor about that particular medication on a case-by-case basis.\n14.
