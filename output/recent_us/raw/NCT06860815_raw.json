Corticosteroids, pyridostigmine), subjects must be on a stable dose for a minimum of 90 days prior to enrollment and must agree not to increase their dose through clinical study duration unless reviewed and approved by the medical monitor and the site investigator.\n\n9.

Subjects who have used immunoglobulins given SC or IV (SCIg or IVIg) or plasmapheresis/plasma exchange (PE) within 4 weeks before Screening.\n7. Subjects who have had thymectomy or any other thymic surgery performed within 12 months prior to Screening.\n8. Subjects with untreated thymic malignancy, carcinoma, or thymoma.\n9.

Subjects who have received the first dose of any COVID-19 vaccine may not screen for the study until 14 days following their last dose of the vaccine if applicable.\n12. Subjects with laboratory test results at Screening or prior to study dosing that are outside the normal limits and considered by the investigator to be clinically significant. Note: Clinically significant laboratory test results at screening that are related to the condition (MG) are acceptable as long as all inclusion and no other exclusion criteria are met.\n13. Subjects with positive test results for hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg), hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antigen/antibody as determined at Screening.\n14. Subjects with a history of or currently active immune disorders other than MG (including autoimmune disease) unless the condition, after discussion with the medical monitor and study site investigator, has been deemed to be acceptable for the subject's participation in this clinical study.\n15. Subjects with a history of or current active diseases other than myasthenia gravis requiring immunosuppressive drugs (including azathioprine, prednisone, prednisolone, budesonide, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, methotrexate, or mycophenolate mofetil) unless the condition, after discussion with the medical monitor and site investigator, has been deemed to be acceptable for the subject's participation in this clinical study.\n16.
