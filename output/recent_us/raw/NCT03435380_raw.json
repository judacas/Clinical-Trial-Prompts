    "inclusion_criteria": "* Histologically confirmed solid tumors that have progressed on or intolerant to standard therapy or whom no standard therapy exists\n* ECOG (electrocorticogram) performance status 0~1\n* Life expectancy ≥ 3 months\n* Adequate organ function and bone marrow function\n\nFor patients with tenosynovial giant cell tumor (TGCT) :\n\n1. A diagnosis of TGCT [i ncluding pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) or giant cell tumors of the tendon sheath (GCT TS) (i) that has been histologically confirmed either by a pathologist at the treating institution or a central pathologist, and (ii) where surgical resection would be associated with potentially worsening functional limitation or severe morbidity (locally advanced disease), with morbidity determined consensually by qualified personnel (eg, two surgeons or a multi disciplinary tumor board);\n2. Measurable disease as defined by RECIST 1.1 (except that a minimal size of 2 cm is required), assessed from MRI scans;\n3. Others\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",

Known allergy or hypersensitivity to any component of the investigational drug product\n2. For expansion part, previous treatment with CSF 1/CSF 1R pathway inhibitors (not applicable for TGCT patients in US）\n3. Others",
