    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Female participants who are at least 18 years of age on the day of signing informed consent with histologically confirmed diagnosis of cervical carcinoma will be enrolled in this study.\n2. Cervical cancer is a disease of the female genital tract. No male patients will be enrolled.\n3. A female participant is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant (see Appendix 3), not breastfeeding, and at least one of the following conditions applies:\n\n   1.

Have measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1. Lesions situated in a previously irradiated area are considered measurable if progression has been demonstrated in such lesions.\n7. Have provided archival tumor tissue sample or newly obtained core or excisional biopsy of a tumor lesion not previously irradiated. Formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks are preferred to slides. Newly obtained biopsies are preferred to archived tissue.\n8.

Patient's life expectancy ≥ 16 weeks.\n10. Have adequate organ function as defined in the following table (Table 1). Specimens must be collected within 10 days prior to the start of study treatment. Before patients can be enrolled, they must have normal laboratory values as outlined in Table 1. Labs must also fall within normal limits prior to infusion.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be FEMALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. A WOCBP who has a positive urine pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to the first dose of treatment (see Appendix 3). If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required.\n2. Note: in the event that 72 hours have elapsed between the screening pregnancy test and the first dose of study treatment, another pregnancy test (urine or serum) must be performed and must be negative in order for subject to start receiving study medication.\n3. Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti PD L2 agent or with an agent directed to another stimulatory or co-inhibitory T-cell receptor (eg, CTLA-4, OX 40, CD137).\n4. Has received prior systemic anti-cancer therapy including investigational agents within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of treatment.\n5. Has received prior radiotherapy within 2 weeks of start of study intervention. Participants must have recovered from all radiation-related toxicities, not require corticosteroids, and not have had radiation pneumonitis. A 1-week washout is permitted for palliative radiation (≤2 weeks of radiotherapy) to non-CNS disease.\n6. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug. Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster (chicken pox), yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (eg, FluMist®) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.\n7. Is currently participating in or has participated in a study of an investigational agent or has used an investigational device within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study intervention.\n8. Concomitant use of known strong CYP3A inhibitors (eg. itraconazole, telithromycin, clarithromycin, protease inhibitors boosted with ritonavir or cobicistat, indinavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, boceprevir, telaprevir) or moderate CYP3A inhibitors (eg. ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, diltiazem, fluconazole, verapamil). The required washout period prior to starting olaparib is 2 weeks.\n9. Concomitant use of known strong (eg. phenobarbital, enzalutamide, phenytoin, rifampicin, rifabutin, rifapentine, carbamazepine, nevirapine and St John's Wort) or moderate CYP3A inducers (eg. bosentan, efavirenz, modafinil). The required washout period prior to starting olaparib is 5 weeks for enzalutamide or phenobarbital and 3 weeks for other agents.\n10. Major surgery within 2 weeks of starting study treatment and patients must have recovered from any effects of any major surgery.\n11. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy (in dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug.\n12. Has a history of a second malignancy, unless potentially curative treatment has been completed with no evidence of malignancy for ≥5 years except: adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer, curatively treated in situ cancer of the cervix, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), Stage 1, grade 1 endometrial carcinoma.\n13. Has known active CNS metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Participants with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are radiologically stable, i.e. without evidence of progression for at least 4 weeks by repeat imaging (note that the repeat imaging should be performed during study screening), clinically stable and without requirement of steroid treatment for at least 14 days prior to first dose of study intervention.\n\n    Patients with symptomatic uncontrolled brain metastases. A scan to confirm the absence of brain metastases is not required. The patient can receive a stable dose of corticosteroids before and during the study as long as these were started at least 4 weeks prior to treatment. Patients with spinal cord compression unless considered to have received definitive treatment for this and evidence of clinically stable disease for 28 days.\n14. Has severe hypersensitivity (≥Grade 3) to pembrolizumab and/or any of its excipients, or patients with a known hypersensitivity to olaparib or any of the excipients of the product.\n15. Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment and is allowed.\n16. Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or has current pneumonitis.\n17. Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.\n18. Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection. Note: No HIV testing is required unless mandated by local health authority. Immunocompromised patients, e.g., patients who are known to be serologically positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), solid organ, and hematopoietic transplant patients.\n19. Has a known history of Hepatitis B (defined as Hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] reactive) or known active Hepatitis C virus (defined as HCV RNA [qualitative] is detected) infection.\n20. Has a known history of active TB (Bacillus Tuberculosis).\n21. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the subject's participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.\n\n    Patients considered a poor medical risk due to a serious, uncontrolled medical disorder, non-malignant systemic disease or active, uncontrolled infection. Examples include, but are not limited to, uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia, recent (within 3 months) myocardial infarction, uncontrolled major seizure disorder, unstable spinal cord compression, superior vena cava syndrome, extensive interstitial bilateral lung disease on High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) scan or any psychiatric disorder that interferes with the requirements of the trial or prohibits obtaining informed consent.\n22. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial.\n23. Is pregnant or breastfeeding or expecting to conceive children within the projected duration of the study, starting with the screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.\n24. Has had an allogenic tissue/solid organ/bone marrow transplant or double umbilical cord blood transplantation (dUCBT).\n25.

Persistent toxicities (>Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event (CTCAE) V. 5.0 grade 2) caused by previous cancer therapy, excluding alopecia.\n27.
