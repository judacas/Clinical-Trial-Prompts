No available SOC therapy that would confer clinical benefit\n7. [Dose escalation] At least one cutaneous, subcutaneous, or nodal injectable tumor (between 1 and 10 cm in largest diameter) that can be injected by direct palpation or with the assistance of ultrasound without the need for interventional radiology\n8. [Expansion] At least one injectable tumor (between 1 and 10 cm in largest diameter) that can be injected either with or without the need for interventional radiology\n9. Measurable disease by RECIST v1.1\n10. ECOG Performance Status of 0, 1, or 2\n11. Resolution of any toxicity associated with prior therapy to ≤ Grade 1 (Residual toxicity of Grade 2 may be allowed following discussion with Medical Monitor)\n12. Adequate hematologic function defined as:\n\n    1. Absolute neutrophil count >1,500/uL\n    2. Platelet count >100,000/uL\n13. Adequate hepatic function defined as:\n\n    1. Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN\n    2. Aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 x ULN\n14. Adequate coagulation defined as:\n\n    1. International normalized ratio (INR) ≤ 1.5 x ULN or prothrombin time (PT) ≤ 1.5 x ULN\n    2. Partial thromboplastin time (PTT) or activated PTT (aPTT) ≤ 1.5 x ULN\n15.

All subjects of childbearing potential must be willing to consent to using effective contraception (as determined by the investigator) while on treatment and for 3 months after their participation in the study ends\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Injectable tumor not sufficiently distanced from critical structures (e.g., major airway, neurovascular structure) where post injection swelling may place the subject at unacceptable risk\n2. ≤ 21 days from prior anticancer therapy and C1D1 (e.g., chemotherapy, immunotherapy, intralesional therapy, irradiation therapy)\n3. Known CNS metastases or leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, unless adequately treated and clinically stable off steroids for ≥ 14 days from C1D1\n4. Severe infection requiring systemic antibiotic therapy or hospitalization for treatment of injection within 2 weeks of the first injection of VAX014\n5. Need for systemic immunosuppressive therapy (≤10mg of prednisone equivalent, or one time pulse steroids excepted)\n6. Any other malignancy likely to require treatment in the next 2 years (exceptions include cancer such as basal or squamous cell skin cancers, noninvasive cancer of the cervix, and local prostate cancer)\n7. Known active Hepatitis B or C\n8. Women who are pregnant or lactating\n9. Clinically significant cardiovascular abnormalities including:\n\n   1. ≤ 12 months from prior MI\n   2. Unstable angina pectoris\n   3. ≤ 6 months from NYHA classification >3 CHF\n10. Medical or psychological condition that places the subject at undue risk with study participation",
