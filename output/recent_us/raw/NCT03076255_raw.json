    "inclusion_criteria": "* History of histologically confirmed, clinical localized adenocarcinoma of the prostate treated with radical prostatectomy with definitive intent\n* Presence of adverse pathologic features at the time of prostatectomy (positive surgical margin, pathologic T-stage 3-4 disease, pathologic Gleason score 8-10 disease, presence of tertiary Gleason grade 5 disease) OR documentation of rising prostate-specific antigen on at least two consecutive draws, with the magnitude of prostate-specific antigen exceeding 0.03 ng/mL\n* Computed tomography (CT) scan and MRI of the pelvis within 120 days prior to enrollment (note: [a] if patient has medical contraindication to MRI, an exemption will be granted and enrollment can proceed [b] for patients with PSA < 1.0 ng/mL, the treatment planning CT can substitute for a diagnostic CT scan)\n* Bone scan within 120 days prior to enrollment; if the bone scan is suspicious, a plain x-ray and/or MRI must be obtained to rule out metastasis, and advanced imaging (e.g., 18NaF positron emission tomography [PET]/CT) is strongly recommended\n* Karnofsky performance score (KPS) >= 70\n* Ability to understand, and willingness to sign, the written informed consent\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be MALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Patients with any evidence of distant metastases\n* Patients with pathologically-confirmed N1 prostate cancer\n* Patients with neuroendocrine or small cell carcinoma of the prostate\n* Prior cryosurgery, high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation (HIFU) or brachytherapy of the prostate\n* Prior pelvic radiotherapy\n* History of Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, or ataxia telangiectasia",
