    "official_title": "Assessing a Biomarker Platform for Stratifying Indeterminate Pulmonary Nodules - The SPOT IT Platform Trial",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Adults 35-year-old and older with undiagnosed IPN(s) 8-30mm referred for evaluation\n\n  * Referral includes direct in-basket messages in the electronic healthcare record (EHR) to study providers, telehealth visits or clinic visit\n  * For multiple nodules, we will obtain the score from the dominant or most suspicious nodule based on providers or radiologist impression\n* Available CT scan with slice thickness of 3 mm or less with the nodule of interest present. Nodules identified during screening low dose computed tomography of the chest (LDCT) that have had a conventional, follow-up CT performed are eligible for inclusion\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 35 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Pure ground glass nodule\n* Patients known to be a prisoners\n* Patients known to be pregnant\n* Known active malignancy within the last 5 years at time of enrollment (excluding non-melanoma skin cancers)\n* More than 5 IPNs present on imaging\n* Nodules referred after initial LDCT for screening with only one LDCT available. The Lung Cancer Prediction Convolutional Neural Network (LCP CNN) algorithm is not currently validated for screening studies\n* Thoracic implants that impact the image appearance of the nodule\n* Clinician determines that use of the LCP CNN model is required or contraindicated for the optimal care of the patient",
