    "exclusion_criteria": "* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmias not well controlled with medication, myocardial infarction within the previous 6 months, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* Patients may not be receiving any other concurrent investigational agents, or have received any investigational agent within four weeks of commencing this protocol.\n* Since the teratogenic potential of this combination is currently unknown, females who are pregnant or lactating are excluded.
