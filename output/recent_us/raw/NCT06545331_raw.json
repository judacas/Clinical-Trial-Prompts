For a lesion to be considered measurable, it must be at least twice the slice thickness on MRI (ie, visible on 2 or more axial slices)\n7. To document the degree of tumor at study baseline, the following scan(s) must be obtained:\n\n   * A brain MRI with and without contrast (ie, gadolinium) and a spine MRI with contrast within 21 days prior to first dose of study treatment. For subjects on steroids, baseline MRI scans must be performed while on stable or decreasing dose of steroids for at least 5 days.\n8.

Subject has adequate pulmonary function defined as:\n\n    * No evidence of dyspnea at rest\n    * A pulse oximetry ≥ 93%\n13. Subject has recovered from clinically significant acute treatment related toxicities from all prior therapies. Recovery is defined as a toxicity Grade ≤ 2 (common terminology criteria for adverse events [CTCAE] v. 4.03).\n14. Subject has no significant worsening in clinical status for a minimum of 7 days prior to first dose of study drug.\n15. Subject (and when applicable, with parental/legal representative) is willing and able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements.\n16. Females of Childbearing Potential (FCBP) and male subjects who have reached puberty (and when applicable, with parental/legal representative) must agree to undergo physician-approved reproductive education and discuss the side effects of the study therapy on reproduction.\n17. Females of childbearing potential must agree and meet the following conditions below:\n\n    * Medically supervised (ie, performed in a clinic) pregnancy testing, including those who commit to true abstinence. Two pregnancy tests must be conducted prior to starting pomalidomide. The first pregnancy test must be performed 10 to 14 days prior to the start of pomalidomide and the second pregnancy test must be performed within 24 hours prior to starting pomalidomide. Females of childbearing potential with regular or no menstrual cycles must also agree to have pregnancy tests weekly for the first 28 days study participation, every 28 days while on study, at study treatment discontinuation, and at Day 28 following pomalidomide discontinuation. If menstrual cycles are irregular, the pregnancy testing must occur weekly for the first 28 days of study participation and then every 14 days while on study, at study treatment discontinuation visit, and at Days 14 and 28 following pomalidomide discontinuation.\n    * Female subjects must, as appropriate to age and at the discretion of the study Investigator, either commit to true abstinence from heterosexual contact and/or agree to the use of two reliable forms of approved and effective contraceptive methods simultaneously. The two methods of reliable contraception must include one highly effective method (ie, oral, injectable, or implantable hormonal contraceptive; tubal ligation; intra-uterine device; vasectomized partner) and one additional effective barrier method (ie, male condom, diaphragm, cervical cap) 28 days prior to starting pomalidomide, throughout the entire duration of study treatment including dose interruptions and 28 days after discontinuation of pomalidomide.\n    * All male and female subjects must follow all requirements defined in the pomalidomide Pregnancy Prevention Program.\n18. Male subjects must, as appropriate to age and the discretion of the study physician:\n\n    * Practice true abstinence or agree to use a condom during sexual contact with a pregnant female or a female of child bearing potential while participating in the study, during dose interruptions and for at least 28 days following pomalidomide discontinuation, even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy or practices complete abstinence.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 1 Year\nMust have maximum age of 21 Years",
