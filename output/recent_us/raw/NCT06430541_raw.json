    "official_title": "An Open Label, Randomised Phase 2 Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of MTL-CEBPA Administered in Combination With Sorafenib or Sorafenib Alone in TKI naïve Participants With Previously Treated Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) and Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C Virus (OUTREACH2)",
    "inclusion_criteria": "1.Written informed consent obtained prior to any specific trial-related procedure.\n\n2.Male or female 18 years or older. 3.Histologically confirmed advanced HCC with cirrhosis in a participant with a history of hepatitis B and/or C. Participants with past or ongoing HCV infection will be eligible for the study. Participants must have completed their treatment at least 1 month prior to starting study intervention and their HCV viral load below the limit of quantification. Participants who are HCV Ab positive but HCV RNA negative due to prior treatment or natural resolution will be eligible. Participants with past or controlled ongoing hepatitis B will be eligible as long as their HBV viral load is less than 500 IU/mL prior to first dose of study drug. Participants on active HBV therapy with viral loads under 100 IU/mL should stay on the same therapy throughout study intervention.\n\n4.Child-Pugh classification A. 5.Unsuitable for liver tumour resection and/or refractory to loco regional therapy.\n\n6.Not eligible for liver transplantation. 7.Had progression or recurrence of HCC following previous treatment with atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab. Participants with progression or recurrence of HCC on non-atezolizumab anti-PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors and non-bevacizumab anti-VEGF agent in combination or as any as single agents, and no prior treatment with atezolizumab and bevacizumab, are eligible.\n\n8.Naïve to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including sorafenib, regorafenib, cabozantinib, and lenvatinib.\n\n9.Participants with BCLC stage C disease. BCLC Stage B will be allowed if not amenable to locoregional therapy or refractory to locoregional therapy, and not amenable to a curative treatment approach (Appendix B).\n\n10.Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1. 11.Has the ability to swallow and retain oral medication. 12.Life expectancy greater than 3 months at time of recruitment. 13.At least one measurable liver lesion (RECIST v1.1) assessed by the investigator.\n\n14.Platelet count >70 x109/L. 15.Serum albumin ≥28g/L. 16.Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤5 x the upper limit of normal (ULN).\n\n17.Bilirubin ≤50 μmol /L. 18.White Blood Cell (WBC) ≥2.0 x 109/L. 19.Absolute neutrophil count ≥1.5 x 109/L. 20.Haemoglobin ≥9.0 g/dL. 21.International Normalized Ratio (INR) <1.5. 22.Calculated creatinine clearance ≥50 mL/min (Cockcroft & Gault). 23.AEs due to prior therapy must have resolved to Grade ≤1 (except alopecia or endocrinopathies that are adequately managed through hormone replacement treatment).\n\n24.Negative blood pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential (within 10 days prior to first drug administration). Note: a woman is considered of child-bearing potential following menarche and until becomingpost-menopausal unless permanently sterile. Permanent methods of sterilisation include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy. A post-menopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause.https://www.hma.eu/fileadmin/dateien/Human_Medicines/01-About_HMA/Working_Groups/CTFG/2014_09_HMA_CTFG_Contraception.pdf(see additional information / requirements in Section 5.1.) 25.Female participants of childbearing potential must use highly effective* contraceptive measures adequate to prevent a new pregnancy for the duration of the study treatment with MTL-CEBPA and sorafenib and, in addition, for at least six months after the last dose of MTL-CEBPA and six months beyond the last dose of sorafenib, as recommended in sorafenib's U.S. Package Insert (USPI). For women with reproductive potential who use a hormonal method of contraception, concurrent use of a second (barrier) method is recommended. * Highly effective methods of birth control are defined as those that result in a low failure rate (i.e. less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly (e.g. implants, injectables, oral contraceptives, some intrauterine devices, bilateral tubal occlusion, true sexual abstinence in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant, or vasectomised partner). (See additional information / requirements https://www.hma.eu/fileadmin/dateien/Human_Medicines/01-About_HMA/Working_Groups/CTFG/2014_09_ HMA_CTFG_Contraception.pdf) 26.Male participants with partners of child-bearing potential must use highly effective contraception and are required to use barrier contraception plus an additional contraceptive method that together result in a failure rate of <1% per year during the treatment period and for at least three months after the last dose of MTL-CEBPA. Male participants will also be advised to abstain from sexual intercourse with pregnant or lactating women, or to use condoms. Male participants with partners of child-bearing potential must use highly effective contraception during treatment with sorafenib and for 3 months beyond the last dose of sorafenib, as recommended in sorafenib's USPI.\n\n27.Abstinence is only acceptable if it is line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods), declaration of abstinence for the duration of exposure to IMP, and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.\n\n28.Able to comply with all the requirements of the protocol. Exclusion Criteria Participants should not enter the study if any of the following exclusion criteria are fulfilled.\n\n1. Child-Pugh classification B and C.\n2. Participants without a history of hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C.\n3. Participants with fibrolamellar and mixed hepatocellular/cholangiocarcinoma subtype HCC.\n4. Participants with no prior therapy who are eligible for first-line treatment with atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab.\n5.

Seasonal influenza vaccinesfor injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (eg, FluMist®) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.\n14. Known other malignancy that is progressing or has required active treatment in the last 5years prior to screening, with the exception of malignancies with a negligible risk of metastasis or death such as early-stage cancers treated with curative intent, basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, in situ cervical cancer, or in situ breast cancer that has undergone potentially curative therapy.\n15.

If the participant had major surgery, the participant must have recovered adequately from the procedure and/or any complications from the surgery prior to starting study intervention.\n19. Participants with a history of organ transplantation.\n20. Diagnosis of immunodeficiency or receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy (in dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy.\n21. Participants with sepsis, ineffective biliary drainage with or without cholangitis, obstructive jaundice, or encephalopathy at screening visit or within the last 2 weeks prior to study treatment initiation.\n22. Evidence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or renal failure, or allergic reaction at screening visit or within the last two weeks prior to study treatment initiation, whichever is earlier.\n23. Pregnant or lactating women.\n24. Known hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients of both MTL-CEBPA and sorafenib.\n25. History or evidence of any other condition or therapy, including a known psychiatric or substance abuse disorder that, in the judgment of the investigator, may interfere with the study conduct or confound the results, pose a risk to the participant, is not in their best interest to take part, or may affect their ability to follow the protocol specific procedures for the duration of the study.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
