    "official_title": "An Open-Label Phase 1/2 Multi-Arm Study of DS-1594b as a Single-Agent and in Combination With Azacitidine and Venetoclax or Mini-HCVD for the Treatment of Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Provision of written (signed) informed consent form (ICF) by the subject or legal guardian prior to the performance of any study-specific procedures, according to International Council on Harmonisation (ICH) and local regulatory requirements. Subject must be fully informed about their illness and the investigational nature of the study protocol (including foreseeable risks and possible toxicities) and must sign and date an Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) approved informed consent form (ICF)(including Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act authorization [HIPAA], if applicable) before performance of any study-specific procedures or examinations\n* Subjects must be willing and able to comply with the protocol\n* Subjects with AML or ALL, diagnosed according to the 2016 criteria by the World Health Organization (WHO) who are refractory or relapsed (any salvage) with no available therapies or not candidates for available therapies. For subjects with prior MDS or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) or MPN who transformed to AML, therapy received for MDS, CMML, or MPN is NOT considered as prior therapy for AML except for MDS or CMML treated with HMAs. Subjects with MDS or CMML treated with HMA therapies who progress to AML and have no available therapies or are not candidates for available therapies, will be eligible at the time of progression to AML. In Phase 1: all R/R AML or R/R ALL subjects irrespective of mutations will be eligible. In Phase 2 Cohort A only R/R AML with MLLr will be eligible. In Phase 2 Cohort B only R/R AML with NPM1m will be eligible. In Phase 2 Cohorts C and D: Only R/R AML or R/R ALL subjects with an MLLr or NPM1m will be eligible\n* Prior therapy with hydroxyurea, chemotherapy, biological or targeted therapy (e.g. FLT3 inhibitors, other kinase inhibitors), or hematopoietic growth factors is permitted\n* Age 18 years or older\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0, 1, or 2\n* Total bilirubin =< 1.5 times upper limit of normal (x ULN)\n* Aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase =< 2.5 x ULN (aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase =< 5.0 x ULN if deemed related to leukemia by the treating physician)\n* Creatinine clearance >= 50 mL/min as calculated using the modified Cockcroft-Gault equation\n* Serum electrolytes within the institution's normal limits: potassium, calcium (total calcium, calcium corrected for serum albumin in case of hypoalbuminemia or ionized calcium) and magnesium. If outside of the institution's normal range, subject will be eligible when electrolytes are corrected\n* In the absence of rapidly progressive disease, the interval from prior treatment to the time of initiation of protocol therapy will be at least 14 days for prior anti-leukemic therapy with the exception of hydroxyurea as noted below OR at least 5 half-lives for cytotoxic/noncytotoxic agents, whichever is shorter. The half-life for the therapy in question will be based on published pharmacokinetic literature (abstracts, manuscripts, investigator brochure's, or drug-administration manuals) and will be documented in the protocol eligibility document. Since the effect of therapy may be delayed, use of hydroxyurea for subjects with rapidly proliferative disease is allowed before the start of study therapy and on study and hydroxyurea will not require a washout\n* Concurrent therapy for central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis or continuation of therapy for controlled CNS disease is permitted. Subjects with a known history of CNS disease or leukemic brain metastasis must have been treated locally, have at least 3 consecutive lumbar punctures (LPs) with no evidence of CNS leukemia, and must be clinically stable for at least 4 weeks prior to enrollment and have no ongoing neurological symptoms that in the opinion of the treating physician are related to the CNS disease (sequelae that are a consequence of the treatment of the CNS disease are acceptable)\n* Females must be surgically or biologically sterile or postmenopausal (amenorrheic for at least 12 months) or if of childbearing potential, must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 72 hours before the start of the treatment\n* Women of childbearing potential must agree to use an adequate method of contraception during the study and until 4 months after the last treatment. Males must be surgically or biologically sterile or agree to use an adequate method of contraception during the study until 3 months after the last treatment. Adequate methods of contraception include:\n\n  * Total abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.\n  * Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment\n  * Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female subjects on the study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that subject\n  * Combination of any of the two following (a+b or a+c or b+c)\n\n    * a. Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or other forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate <1%), for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception.\n    * b. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS).\n    * c. Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository.\n  * In case of use of oral contraception, women should have been stable on the same pill before taking study treatment.\n  * Note: Oral contraceptives are allowed but should be used in conjunction with a barrier method of contraception due to unknown effect of drug-drug interaction. Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child-bearing potential if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child-bearing potential\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
