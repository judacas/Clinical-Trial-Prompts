Female subjects who are of non-reproductive potential (i.e., post-menopausal by history-no menses for ≥2 year; OR history of hysterectomy; OR history of bilateral tubal ligation; OR history of bilateral oophorectomy). Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test upon study entry.\n13. Male and female subjects who agree to use highly effective methods of birth control (e.g.,condoms, implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some intrauterine devices[IUDs], sexual abstinence, or sterilized partner) during the period of therapy and for 30 days after the last dose of study drug and 90 days (males) after the last dose of study drug.\n\nSymptomatic disease meeting at least 1 of the recommendations from the Second International Workshop on Waldenström Macroglobulinemia for requiring treatment (Kyle 2003):\n\n1. Constitutional symptoms documented in the subject's chart with supportive objective measures, as appropriate, defined as one or more of the following disease-related symptoms or signs:\n\n   1. Unintentional weight loss ≥10% within the previous 6 months prior to Screening\n   2. Fevers higher than 100.5°F or 38.0°C for 2 or more weeks prior to Screening without evidence of infection\n   3. Night sweats for more than 1 month prior to Screening without evidence of infection\n2. Clinically relevant fatigue which is not relieved by rest due to WM\n3. Symptomatic hyperviscosity or serum viscosity levels greater than 4.0 centipoises\n4. Lymphadenopathy which is either symptomatic or bulky (≥5cm in maximum diameter)\n5. Symptomatic hepatomegaly and/or splenomegaly and/or organ tissue infiltration\n6. Peripheral neuropathy due to WM\n7. Symptomatic cryoglobulinemia\n8. Cold agglutinin anemia\n9.

Serum monoclonal protein >5g/dL, with or without overt clinical symptoms.\n15. Any other condition or circumstance that would, in the opinion of the investigator, make the patient unsuitable for participation in the study.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 95 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Criteria for exclusion:\n\nPatients who meet any of the following exclusion criteria are not to be enrolled in this study:\n\n1. For Arm A only: Patients who have never been treated with ibrutinib.\n2. For Arm B only: Patients who have previously received any treatment for WM.\n3. For Arm C only:\n\n   1. Patients who have previously been treated with ibrutinib or other BTK inhibitor.\n   2. Disease that is refractory to the last prior rituximab based-therapy defined as either Relapse after the last rituximab-based therapy (<12 months since last dose of rituximab), OR Failure to achieve at least a MR after the last rituximab-based therapy.\n   3.
