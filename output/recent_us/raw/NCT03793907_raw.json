Must have a previous biopsy demonstrating HER2 expression in at least one lesion (HER2+ patients or breast cancer patients who are HER2+ or HER2-low) as defined by IHC and FISH studies or with HER2 amplification as defined by a liquid biopsy that was done as standard of care testing for the patient's cancer type.\n4. Measurable disease on CT, FDG-PET, or MRI imaging for RECIST evaluation; patient must have measurable disease outside the liver.\n5. Life expectancy of at least 6 months.
