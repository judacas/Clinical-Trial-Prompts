    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Willing and able to provide informed consent\n2. ≥18 years of age at the time of signing the informed consent form\n3. Pathologically documented histological or cytological evidence of NSCLC, HNSCC, or melanoma.\n4. Has at least 1 measurable target lesion per RECIST v1.1 that has not been resected/biopsied/or irradiated before enrollment in the study\n5. Diagnosis of locally advanced unresectable or metastatic NSCLC, HNSCC, or melanoma in subjects who are ICI treatment-naive or relapsed/refractory, including PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors\n6. ICI treatment-naive subjects must meet the following criteria:\n\n   1. NSCLC: Subjects with metastatic or with unresectable, recurrent NSCLC whose tumors must have no EGFR or ALK genomic aberrations and express PD-L1 [TPS≥50%]\n   2. HNSCC: Subjects with metastatic or with unresectable, recurrent HNSCC whose tumors express PD-L1 [CPS ≥20]\n   3. Melanoma: Irrespective of PD-L1 result and BRAF V600 mutation\n   4. Subjects has not received prior systemic treatment for their metastatic tumor. Subjects who received adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy are eligible if the adjuvant/neoadjuvant therapy was completed at least 6 months before the development of metastatic disease.\n7. ICI treatment-refractory subjects as defined by the following criteria:\n\n   1. Has received at least 2 cycles of anti-PD-(L)1 therapy either as monotherapy or in combination\n   2. Has demonstrated disease progression after ICI treatment by RECIST v1.1\n   3. Has received less than three lines of systemic therapy for metastatic tumor\n8. ECOG performance status of 0 or 1\n9. Be willing to provide archival tissue or fresh biopsy\n10. Have adequate organ function\n11. All Grade 3 or greater AEs resolved earlier to Grade 2 or less\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Cancer type and genomic tumor aberrations:\n\n   1. NSCLC subjects with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations\n   2. HNSCC subjects with nasopharyngeal cancer\n2. For ICI refractory/relapsed subjects: Immune related AEs ≥Grade 3 that led to discontinuation of prior immune-modulatory agents including PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors\n3. With uncontrolled or untreated brain metastasis or leptomeningeal disease\n4. Active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years\n5. Received a fecal transplant\n6. Concurrent participation in another interventional clinical study or use of another investigational agent within 30 days of study consent\n7. Contraindication to IV contrast that cannot be managed with pre-medication\n8. Female subjects who are pregnant or breastfeeding\n9.

Has received whole blood transfusion, blood component transfusion, or colony stimulating factors within 1 week prior to the 1st dose of study treatment\n14. In the judgment of the investigator, subjects unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions and requirements\n15. Has active interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis or a history of ILD/pneumonitis requiring treatment with systemic steroids\n16. Have allergy to clindamycin, erythromycin, and ampicillin\n17. Has signs and symptoms of colitis at screening\n18. Infection requiring systemic antibacterial, antifungal, or antiviral therapy within 14 days before study treatment (Note: Antiviral therapy is permitted for subjects with chronic HBV or HCV infection)\n19. Untreated chronic hepatitis B or chronic HBV carriers with HBV DNA>500 IU/mL (or >2500 copies/mL) at screening (Note: Inactive hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg) carriers, treated and stable hepatitis B (HBV DNA < 500 IU/mL or < 2500 copies/mL) can be enrolled. Subjects with detectable HbsAg or detectable HBV DNA should be managed per treatment guidelines. Subjects receiving antivirals at screening should have been treated for > 2 weeks before study treatment.)\n20. With active hepatitis C (Note: Subjects with a negative HCV antibody test at screening or positive HCV antibody test followed by a negative HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) test at screening are eligible. The HCV RNA test will be performed only for subjects testing positive for HCV antibody. Subjects receiving antivirals at screening should have been treated for > 2 weeks before study treatment.)\n21. Known history of HIV infection\n22. History of active inflammatory bowel disease with diarrhea believed to be caused by active inflammatory bowel disease in the past 12 months\n23. Major surgery for any reason, except diagnostic biopsy, within 4 weeks of study informed consent and or if the subject has not fully recovered from the surgery within 4 weeks of informed consent\n24. History of major gastrointestinal surgery\n25. History or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the trial\n26.
