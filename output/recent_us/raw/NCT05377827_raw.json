Subjects for whom fresh samples cannot be safely provided (e.g., inaccessible tumor for biopsy or has metastatic lung lesion(s) as the only site of metastatic disease) will not be eligible for study participation.\n* Must have available archival tissue and subjects have consented to allow collection of archived tumor blocks from previous surgeries confirming or treating unresectable stage III or distant metastatic disease. If more than one archived tumor blocks are available, two blocks have to be analyzed for the presence of Tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte/Tumor-associated lymphocyte (TIL/TALS). Archived tumor tissues must fulfill the following criteria based on two representative Hematoxylin & Eosin (H&E)-stained tissue sections: (1) the tumor surface area must be at least 1cm (squared), (2) no more than 20% of necrosis, (3) the ratio of viable tumor cells to tumor-associated stroma should be at least 60/40, (4) if TILs are present based on H&E stained sections, they must be ≤ 1% of the total number of cells in the specimen; the amount of tissue should be ≥ 1 cm2.\n\nThe study pathologists must sign off on the eligibility of archived tumor blocks before study enrollment. If archival tissue is unavailable or insufficient, fresh biopsy should be performed to confirm unresectable stage III or distant metastatic disease.\n\n* Previous treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors and chemotherapies is allowed on condition that the last treatment is at least 28 days prior to first dose of entinostat. Previous treatment with targeted therapies (e.g. Mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitors) is allowed on condition that the last treatment was administered at least 15 days prior to first dose of entinostat).\n* Demonstrate adequate organ function as defined in the protocol table; all screening labs to be obtained within 21 days prior to entinostat treatment.\n\n  *Note: Hematology and other lab parameters that are ≤ grade 2 but still meet criteria for study entry are allowed. Furthermore, changes in laboratory parameters during the study should not be considered Adverse events (AEs) unless they meet criteria for dose modification(s) of study medication outlined by the protocol in Section 5.3.1 and/or worsen from baseline during therapy.\n* A female of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test during screening and a negative urine pregnancy test within 3 days prior to receiving the first dose of study drug. If the screening serum test is done within 3 days prior to receiving the first dose of study drug, a urine test is not required. A female of childbearing potential must agree to use effective contraception during the study and for 120 days after the last dose of study drug. A female of non-childbearing potential defined as (by other than medical reasons):\n\n  -≥45 years of age and has not had menses for >2 years,\n* Amenorrheic for <2 years without a hysterectomy and oophorectomy and a follicle-stimulating hormone value in the postmenopausal range upon pre-study (screening) evaluation,\n* Post hysterectomy, oophorectomy or tubal ligation. Documented hysterectomy or oophorectomy must be confirmed with medical records of the actual procedure or confirmed by an ultrasound. Tubal ligation must be confirmed with medical records of the actual procedure; otherwise the patient must be willing to use 2 adequate barrier methods throughout the study, starting with the screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of entinostat,\n* If male, agrees to use an adequate method of contraception starting with the first dose of study drug through 120 days after the last dose of entinostat,\n* See section 5.6.2 for information on acceptable methods of contraception.\n* Experienced resolution of toxic effect(s) of the most recent prior anti-cancer therapy to Grade ≤1 (except alopecia or neuropathy) by CTCAE v5.0. Exceptions are patients who may have developed autoimmune-type side effects that require permanent hormonal replacement from previous therapies.\n* If the patient underwent major surgery or radiation therapy, these procedures must have occurred at least 15 days prior to the first dose of entinostat. In addition, patients must have recovered from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention to Grade ≤1.\n* Subjects must be willing and able to comply with study procedures based on the judgment of the investigator or protocol designee.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 99 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "All subjects meeting any of the exclusion criteria at baseline will be excluded from study.\n\n* Is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy for autoimmune side effects related to previous use of immunotherapies for melanoma.

Patients with carcinomatous meningitis are also excluded. Exceptions are:\n\n  * Subjects with previously treated brain metastases provided they are stable (i.e. without evidence of progression by brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or head CT with IV contrast) for at least 2 weeks prior to the first dose of entinostat.
