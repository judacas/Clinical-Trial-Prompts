    "inclusion_criteria": "* Participant has histologically confirmed diagnosis of high-grade serous or high-grade endometrioid ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer\n* Measurable disease, i.e., at least one measurable lesion per RECIST 1.1 criteria (a lesion at a previously irradiated site may only be counted as a target lesion if there is clear sign of progression since the irradiation)\n* If no measurable disease is present, the disease should be assessable by Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup criteria (GCIC) for CA-125\n* Participant has no germline BRCA1/2 mutation as determined by an FDA approved assay.\n* Participant has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1\n* Participant has platinum-resistant (progression within one to six months after completing platinum-based therapy) or platinum refractory disease (progression during treatment or within 4 weeks after the last dose), where platinum-based therapy is not an option, according to the GCIG 5th Ovarian Cancer Consensus Conference definitions. The platinum-based chemotherapy regimen does not necessarily need to be the last regimen the participant received prior to study entry.\n* Participant must have received at least one but no more than three prior systemic treatment regimens and for whom single-agent chemotherapy is appropriate as the next line of treatment.\n* Participant has adequate bone marrow and organ function\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 100 Years",

Exception to this criterion: participants with any grade of alopecia are allowed to enter the study.\n* Participants with liver impairment and Child Pugh score B or C\n* Participant has received radiotherapy ≤ 4 weeks or limited field radiation for palliation ≤2 weeks prior to randomization, and who has not recovered to baseline, grade 1 or better from related side effects of such therapy (with the exception of alopecia).\n* Participant has a known hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs or excipients\n\nOther inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply",
