Willingness to abstain from any strenuous physical exercise from 96 hours (4 days) prior to admission and during confinement at the clinical site.\n12. Good physical and mental health on the basis of medical history, physical examination, clinical laboratory assessments, 12-lead electrocardiograms, and vital signs, as judged by the Investigator.\n13. Willing and able to sign the informed consent form.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 55 Years",

Positive screen for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C virus antibodies, or human immunodeficiency virus 1 and 2 antibodies.\n10. Consumption of any nutrients known to modulate CYP450 enzymes activity (e.g., grapefruit or grapefruit juice, pomelo juice, star fruit, or Seville [blood] orange products) within 14 days prior to the first administration of study drug and during the study (including washout period/clinic furlough until after discharge in the last study period).\n11. Participation in a drug study within 30 days prior to study drug administration in the current study. Participation in 4 or more other drug studies in the 12 months prior to study drug administration in the current study.\n12. History of donation of more than 450 mL of blood within 60 days prior to dosing in the clinical site or planned donation before 30 days has elapsed since intake of study drug.\n13.
