Of childbearing potential and practicing at least 1 highly effective method of contraception (see Appendix 17.3). NOTE: Participant must agree to continue the above throughout the study and for 3 months after the last dose of study treatment.\n\n   NOTE: If a woman becomes of childbearing potential after start of the study, the woman must comply with point (b) as described above.\n9. A female participant must agree not to donate eggs (ova, oocytes) or freeze for future use for the purposes of assisted reproduction during the study and for a period of 3 months after receiving the last dose of study treatment. Female participants should consider preservation of eggs prior to study treatment, as anti-cancer treatments may impair fertility.\n10. A female participant must agree to not breastfeed during the study and for a period of 5 months after receiving the last dose of study treatment.\n11. A male participant must wear a condom when engaging in any activity that allows for passage of ejaculate to another person during the study and for a period of 3 months after receiving the last dose of study treatment. If the male participant's partner is a female of childbearing potential, the male participant must use condoms (with or without spermicide), and the female partner of the male participant must also be practicing a highly effective method of contraception (see Appendix 17.3).\n\n    NOTE: If the male participant is vasectomized, he still must wear a condom (with or without spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository), but his female partner is not required to use contraception.\n12. A male participant must agree not to donate sperm for the purpose of reproduction during the study and for period of 3 months after receiving the last dose of study treatment. Male participants should consider preservation of sperm prior to study treatment, as anti-cancer treatments may impair fertility.\n13.

Patients with resolved infection (ie, patients who are HBsAg negative but positive for antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) and/or antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen [anti-HBs]) must be screened using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) measurement of HBV DNA levels. Those who are PCR positive will be excluded. In the event the infection status is unclear, quantitative viral levels are necessary to determine the infection status; see Section 10.3.5.2.1 for further required assessments.\n\n      EXCEPTION: Participants with serologic findings suggestive of HBV vaccination (anti-HBs positivity as the only serologic marker) AND a known history of prior HBV vaccination do not need to be tested for HBV DNA by PCR.\n   3.
