The investigators do not expect many of these adverse reactions with LS301 because it is not radioactive and does not possess iodinated counter ions.\n* Presence of underlying lung disease\n* Pregnant. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test no more than 7 days before start of participation.\n* Breastfeeding.
