Patients must meet the following minimum washout periods prior to enrollment:\n* Myelosuppressive chemotherapy: At least 14 days after the last dose of myelosuppressive chemotherapy (42 days for nitrosourea or mitomycin C).\n\nPatients on Cohort C may have received any of the following medications without a \"wash-out\" period as long as other organ function requirements are met (methotrexate must not be given within 48 hours of ALRN-6924 planned start):\n\nStandard maintenance therapy [any combination of vincristine, 6-mercaptopurine, corticosteroids, and/or low-dose methotrexate (45 mg/m2/week or less)]; Hydroxyurea; Patients on any cohort may have received intrathecal chemotherapy with methotrexate, hydrocortisone and/or cytarabine (non-liposomal) without a \"wash-out\" period as long as other organ function requirements are met (methotrexate must not be given within 48 hours of ALRN-6924 planned start).\n\n* Radiotherapy:\n\n  * At least 14 days after local XRT (small port, including cranial radiation);\n  * At least 90 days must have elapsed after prior TBI, craniospinal XRT or if >50% radiation of pelvis;\n  * At least 42 days must have elapsed if other substantial BM radiation;\n  * At least 42 days must have passed since last MIBG or other radionuclide therapy.\n* Small molecule biologic therapy: At least 7 days following the last dose of a biologic agent. For agents with known adverse events occurring beyond 7 days, this duration must be extended beyond the time in which adverse events are known to occur. If extended duration is required, this should be discussed with and approved by the overall PI.\n* Monoclonal antibody: At least 21 days must have elapsed after the last dose of antibody.\n* Myeloid growth factors: At least 14 days following the last dose of long-acting growth factor (e.g. Neulasta) or 7 days following short-acting growth factor.\n* Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant and stem cell boost: Patients must be at least 60 days from day 0 of an autologous stem cell transplant or stem cell boost.\n* Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant or cellular therapies (including CAR-T cells): The patient must have no evidence of graft versus host diseaseand at least 90 days must have elapsed after allogeneic stem cell infusion. At least 42 days must have elapsed after last dose of other cellular therapy.\n* Solid Organ Transplantation: Patients with hepatoblastoma treated with liver transplantation will be eligible to enroll if they meet all of the following requirements:\n\n  * At least 90 days must have elapsed from the date of liver transplant;\n  * No clinical or radiographic evidence of rejection since the date of transplant; AND\n  * All organ function requirements are met.\n* Major Surgery: At least 2 weeks from prior major surgical procedure. Note: Biopsy, CNS shunt placement/revision, and central line placement/removal are not considered major.\n* MDM2 inhibitors: Patients for Cohorts A and C may have received prior MDM2 inhibitor therapy. Patients in Cohort B must not have received prior MDM2 inhibitor therapy. Patients in all cohorts must not have received dual MDM2/MDMX inhibition.\n* Participants must have normal organ function as defined below.\n* Bone Marrow Function for Subjects in Cohorts A and B without Bone Marrow Involvement by Disease:\n\n  * Absolute neutrophil count ≥1,000 /uL\n  * Platelets ≥75,000 /uL and transfusion independent, defined as not receiving a platelet transfusion for at least 5 days prior to CBC documenting eligibility.\n* Hematologic Requirements for Subjects in Cohorts A and B with Bone Marrow Involvement by Disease:\n\n  * Absolute neutrophil count ≥750 /uL\n  * Platelets ≥50,000 /uL (may receive platelet transfusions)\n  * Not known to be refractory to red cell and/or platelet transfusions.\n* Bone Marrow Function for Subjects in Cohorts C with Acute Leukemia\n\n  ---Not known to be refractory to red cell and/or platelet transfusions\n* Hepatic Function:\n\n  * Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal for age except for patients with known Gilbert syndrome who may enroll using direct bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal for age as bilirubin criterion\n  * ALT (SGPT) ≤ 3 x upper limit of normal (135 U/L). For the purpose of this study, the ULN for ALT is 45 U/L. Patients with acute leukemia AND leukemic infiltration of the liver may enroll to Cohort C if ALT < grade 2 and total bilirubin meets above requirement.\n  * Serum albumin > 2 g/dL\n* Renal Function:\n\n  * A serum creatinine within protocol limits based on age/sex. OR\n  * Creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for participants with creatinine levels greater than the above age/sex maximum allowed values.\n* Adequate Cardiac Function: QTc < 480 msec\n* For patients with CNS tumors (primary or metastatic), any baseline neurologic deficits (including seizure) must be stable for at least one week prior to study enrollment.

    "exclusion_criteria": "* Patients receiving medications within 48 hours of enrollment that are primarily cleared by organic anion transporter polypeptide [OATP] members OATP1B1 and OATP1B3\n* Pregnant participants will not be entered on this study given that the effects of ALRN-6924 on the developing human fetus are unknown.\n* Breastfeeding mothers are not eligible, because there is an unknown risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with ALRN-6924.\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to ALRN-6924.\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* Patients with a known history of HIV, hepatitis B, and/or hepatitis C (testing not required as part of screening).\n* Patients with a known personal history of angioedema or known family history of hereditary angioedema.",
