Use of an experimental vaccine within 2 months in the absence of tumor response. The subject should be excluded if their disease is responding to an experimental vaccine given within 6 months\n   9. Any previous gene therapy using an integrated vector\n   10. Duration of treatment free intervals for any other anti-cancer therapies must be discussed with Adaptimmune Study Physician.\n5. Toxicity persisting from previous anti-cancer therapy of ≥ Grade 2 (except for non-clinically significant toxicities, e.g., alopecia, vitiligo). Subjects with Grade 2 toxicities that are deemed stable or irreversible (e.g. peripheral neuropathy) can be enrolled on a case-by-case basis with prior consultation and agreement with the Sponsor Study Physician.\n6. Major surgery within 4 weeks prior to lymphodepletion; subjects should have been fully recovered from any surgical related toxicities.\n7. Bleeding ≥ Grade 2 in the past 3 months prior to lymphodepletion\n8. Therapeutic anticoagulation from lymphodepletion until platelet count recovery (prophylactic heparin allowed)\n9. Clinically or radiographically detectable ascites (beyond trace/rim of ascites) or ascites requiring medication\n10. Clinically detectable hepatic encephalopathy or hepatic encephalopathy requiring medication\n11. Active viral hepatitis Subjects positive for hepatitis B surface antigen not on antiviral treatment/prophylaxis or subjects with detectable hepatitis B DNA\n\n    1. Subjects with resolved (surface antigen negative, core antibody positive) or chronic stable (surface antigen positive) hepatitis B on antiviral treatment/prophylaxis with DNA levels of ≤100 IU/mL are allowed with HBV DNA monitoring after treatment\n    2. Subjects with hepatitis C allowed provided they meet all other eligibility criteria\n12. Positive serology for HIV\n13. Positive serology for HTLV 1 or 2\n14. History of chronic or recurrent (within the last year) severe autoimmune or immune mediated disease requiring steroids or other immunosuppressive treatments. Subjects with history of idiopathic autoimmune hepatitis are excluded. Subjects who experienced hepatitis during treatment with check point inhibiting antibodies are not excluded.\n15.
