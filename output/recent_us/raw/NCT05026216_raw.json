    "exclusion_criteria": "* Participant must not have received more than 3 therapy regimens for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (NOTE: GnRHa, first-generation antiandrogens (flutamide, nilutamide, or bicalutamide), diethylstilbestrol (DES) (or other estrogens), corticosteroids, ketoconazole, and bone loss-prevention will not count as systemic therapy regimens.\n* Participants must not have previously received abemaciclib or any cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)4 and/or CDK6 inhibitors.\n* Participants must not have serious and/or uncontrolled preexisting medical condition(s) including but not limited to severe renal impairment, severe hepatic impairment, interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis, severe dyspnea at rest or requiring oxygen therapy or other serious preexisting medical condition(s) that, in the judgment of the investigator, would preclude participation in this study.\n* Participants must not have, or suspected to have, brain metastasis.\n* Participants must not have untreated spinal cord compression, evidence of spinal metastases with risk of spinal compression or structurally unstable bone lesions suggesting impending fracture.",
