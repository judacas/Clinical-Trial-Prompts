A participant with any gastrointestinal disease that would impair ability to swallow, retain, or absorb drug is not eligible\n* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >= 1,000/mm^3 unless due to bone marrow involvement\n\n  * NOTE: Growth factor is not permitted within 14 days of ANC assessment unless cytopenia is secondary to disease involvement\n* Platelets >= 75,000/mm^3 unless due to bone marrow involvement, and independent of transfusion support, with no active bleeding\n* Direct bilirubin =< 1.5 X upper limit of normal (ULN) (unless has Gilbert's disease or compensated hemolysis directly attributable to CLL)\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) =< 2.5 X ULN\n* Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) =< 2.5 X ULN\n* Estimated creatinine clearance of >= 30 mL/min using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) formula\n* IF NOT RECEIVING ANTICOAGULANTS: International normalized ratio (INR) OR prothrombin (PT) =< 1.5 x ULN; IF ON ANTICOAGULANT THERAPY: PT must be within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants\n* IF NOT RECEIVING ANTICOAGULANTS: Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) =< 1.5 x ULN; IF ON ANTICOAGULANT THERAPY: aPTT must be within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants\n* Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP): negative serum pregnancy test\n* Agreement by females and males of childbearing potential to use an effective method of birth control or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course of the study through at least 3 months after the last dose of protocol therapy\n\n  * A woman is considered of childbearing potential, ie, fertile, following menarche and until becoming postmenopausal unless permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy. Contraception methods include the following:\n\n    * Combined (estrogen- and progestogen- containing) hormonal contraception associated with the inhibition of ovulation or oral, intravaginal, or transdermal\n    * Progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with the inhibition of ovulation or oral, injectable, implantable\n    * An intrauterine device\n    * Intrauterine hormone-releasing system\n    * Bilateral tubal occlusion vasectomized partner (provided that the vasectomized partner is the sole sexual partner of the woman of childbearing potential study participant and that the vasectomized partner has received medical assessment of surgical success)\n    * Sexual abstinence (defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatment, starting the day prior to first dose of study drug, for the duration of the study, and for >= 90 days after the last dose of zanubrutinib or ibrutinib. Total sexual abstinence should only be used as a contraceptive method if it is in line with the patients' usual and preferred lifestyle. Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods), declaration of abstinence for the duration of exposure to investigational medicinal product, and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. Of note, barrier contraception (including male and female condoms with or without spermicide) is not considered a highly effective method of contraception, and, if used, this method must be used in combination with another acceptable method listed above. If patient is using hormonal contraceptives such as birth control pills or devices, a barrier method of contraception (eg, condoms) must also be used. A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle-stimulating hormone level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single follicle-stimulating hormone measurement is insufficient\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Chronic use of corticosteroids in excess of 20 mg/day prednisone or its equivalent\n* Major surgery (under general anesthesia) within 30 days prior to therapy\n* Uncontrolled coagulopathy or bleeding disorder.

Participants with positive serology are eligible in case of negative HCV RNA test results\n* Known positive test result for chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (defined by hepatitis B virus surface antigen [HBsAg] positivity)\n\n  * Participants with occult or prior HBV infection (defined as negative HBsAg and positive total hepatitis B core antibody) may be included if HBV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was undetectable, provided that they are willing to undergo ongoing DNA testing.\n  * Antiviral prophylaxis may be administered as per institutional guidelines.\n  * Participants who have protective titers of HBsAb after vaccination or prior but cured hepatitis B are eligible\n* Known seropositive for or history of active viral infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\n* Clinically significant cardiovascular disease including the following:\n\n  * Myocardial infarction within 6 months before screening\n  * Unstable angina within 3 months before screening\n  * New York Heart Association class III or IV congestive heart failure\n  * History of clinically significant arrhythmias (eg, sustained ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, Torsades de Pointes)\n  * QTcF > 480 milliseconds based on Fridericia's formula\n  * History of Mobitz II second-degree or third-degree heart block without a permanent pacemaker in place\n* Known severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)\n* Known hepatic cirrhosis or severe pre-existing hepatic impairment\n* Major surgery (requiring general anesthesia) within 14 days before the first dose of study drug or a scheduled surgery during study period\n* Patients with clinically significant medical condition of malabsorption, inflammatory bowel disease, chronic conditions which manifest with diarrhea, refractory nausea, vomiting or any other condition that will interfere significantly with drug absorption\n* Females only: Pregnant or breastfeeding\n* Any other condition that would, in the investigator's judgment, contraindicate the patient's participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns with clinical study procedures\n* Prospective participants who, in the opinion of the investigator, may not be able to comply with all study procedures (including compliance issues related to feasibility/logistics)",
