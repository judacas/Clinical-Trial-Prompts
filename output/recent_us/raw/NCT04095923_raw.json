    "official_title": "A Multi-center, Randomized, Placebo-controlled, Double-blind, Adaptive Clinical Trial of Vitamin C, Thiamine and Steroids as Combination Therapy in Patients With Sepsis.",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Suspected or confirmed infection as evidenced by ordering of blood cultures and administration of at least one antimicrobial agent\n* Anticipated or confirmed intensive care unit (ICU) admission\n* Acute respiratory or cardiovascular organ dysfunction attributed to sepsis as evidenced by at least one of the following requirements:\n\n  1. Vasopressor Requirement - Continuous infusion of norepinephrine, epinephrine, vasopressin, dopamine, phenylephrine or other vasopressor agents at any dose for greater than 1 hour and required to maintain a mean arterial pressure ≥ 65 mm Hg despite intravenous crystalloid infusion of at least 1000cc\n  2. Respiratory Support Requirement - Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure defined as persistent hypoxemia (partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ≤ 300 or blood oxygen saturation (SpO2)/FiO2 ≤ 315) requiring (1) intubation and mechanical ventilation, or (2) positive pressure ventilation via tight-fitting face mask (i.e. continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) or (3) high flow nasal cannula ≥ 40 liter per minute (LPM) flow and FiO2 ≥ 0.40\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Weight < 40 kilograms (kg)\n* Prior enrollment in this study\n* Qualifying organ dysfunction no longer present at the time subject would be randomized\n* Cardiovascular or respiratory organ failure caused by an illness other than sepsis\n* First episode of qualifying organ dysfunction during the current emergency department (ED) or ICU admission occurred > 24 hours before the subject could be randomized\n* Limitations of care (defined as refusal of cardiovascular and respiratory support modes) including \"do not intubate\" (DNI) status\n* Current hospitalization > 30 days at time of randomization\n* Chronic hypoxemia requiring supplemental non-invasive oxygen (nasal cannula or NIPPV) or home mechanical ventilation\n* Chronic cardiovascular failure requiring home mechanical hemodynamic support (e.g., LVAD) or home chemical hemodynamic support (e.g., milrinone)\n* Known allergy or contraindication to vitamin C, thiamine, and/or corticosteroids (including previously or currently diagnosed primary hyperoxaluria and/or oxalate nephropathy, or known/suspected ethylene glycol ingestion, or known glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency)\n* Use of vitamin C at a dose of > 1 gram daily within the 24 hours preceding first episode of qualifying organ dysfunction during a given ED or ICU admission\n* Chronic disease/illness that, in the opinion of the site investigator, have an expected lifespan of < 30 days unrelated to current sepsis diagnosis (e.g., stage IV malignancy, neurodegenerative disease, etc.)\n* Pregnancy or known active breastfeeding\n* Prisoner or Incarceration\n* Current participation in another interventional research study\n* Inability or unwillingness of subject or legal surrogate/representative to give written informed consent",
