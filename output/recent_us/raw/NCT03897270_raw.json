Subjects are excluded if they have leptomeningeal disease or metastases causing spinal cord compression that are symptomatic or untreated or not stable for greater than or equal to 3 months (documented by imaging) or requiring corticosteroids greater than 20 mg prednisone equivalent daily.\n* Must have discontinued active immunotherapy, chemotherapy, or investigational anticancer therapy at least 4 weeks prior to entering the study and oral targeted therapy at least 2 weeks prior to entering the study.\n* All prior anti-cancer treatment-related toxicities (except alopecia and laboratory values listed in protocol eligibility) must be less than or equal to Grade 1 or irreversible (hypophysitis) according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5 at the time of starting treatment. Patients that are asymptomatic on low dose maintenance hormone replacement delivered at a stable dose for prior toxicities are eligible.\n* Prior or concurrent cancer therapy.
