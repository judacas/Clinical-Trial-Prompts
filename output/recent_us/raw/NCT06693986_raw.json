    "official_title": "A Phase 3 Study of 131I-Metaiodobenzylguanidine (131I-MIBG) or ALK Inhibitor Therapy Added to Intensive Therapy for Children With Newly Diagnosed High-Risk Neuroblastoma (NBL)",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Patients must be enrolled on ANBL00B1 (NCT00904241) or APEC14B1 (NCT02402244) prior to enrollment on ANBL1531 (NCT03126916)\n* Patient must be >= 365 days and =< 30 years of age at diagnosis\n* Patients must have a diagnosis of neuroblastoma or ganglioneuroblastoma (nodular) verified by tumor pathology analysis or demonstration of clumps of tumor cells in bone marrow with elevated urinary catecholamine metabolites; the following disease groups are eligible:\n\n  * Patients with International Neuroblastoma Risk Group (INRG) stage M disease are eligible if found to have either of the following features:\n\n    * MYCN amplification (> 4-fold increase in MYCN signals as compared to reference signals), regardless of additional biologic features; OR\n    * Age > 547 days regardless of biologic features\n  * Patients with INRG stage MS disease with MYCN amplification\n  * Patients with INRG stage L2 disease with MYCN amplification\n  * Patients > 547 days of age initially diagnosed with INRG stage L1, L2 or MS disease who progressed to stage M without prior chemotherapy may enroll within 4 weeks of progression to stage M\n  * Patients >= 365 days of age initially diagnosed with MYCN amplified INRG stage L1 disease who progress to stage M without systemic therapy may enroll within 4 weeks of progression to stage M\n* Patients initially recognized to have high-risk disease must have had no prior systemic therapy (other than topotecan/cyclophosphamide initiated on an emergent basis and within allowed timing); patients observed or treated with a single cycle of chemotherapy per a low or intermediate risk neuroblastoma regimen (e.g., as per ANBL0531, ANBL1232 or similar) for what initially appeared to be non-high risk disease but subsequently found to meet the criteria will also be eligible; patients who receive localized emergency radiation to sites of life-threatening or function-threatening disease prior to or immediately after establishment of the definitive diagnosis will be eligible\n* Creatinine clearance or radioisotope glomerular filtration rate (GFR) >= 70 mL/min/1.73 m^2 or a serum creatinine based on age/sex as follows:\n\n  * 1 to < 2 years: male = 0.6; female = 0.6\n  * 2 to < 6 years: male = 0.8; female = 0.8\n  * 6 to < 10 years: male = 1; female = 1\n  * 10 to < 13 years: male = 1.2; female = 1.2\n  * 13 to < 16 years: male = 1.5; female = 1.4\n  * >= 16 years: male = 1.7; female = 1.4\n* Total bilirubin =< 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) for age, and\n* Serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) (alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) < 10 x ULN; for the purposes of this study, ULN for SGPT (ALT) is 45\n* Shortening fraction of >= 27% by echocardiogram, or ejection fraction of > 50% by echocardiogram or radionuclide angiogram\n* No known contraindication to peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) collection; examples of contraindications might be a weight or size less than the collecting institution finds feasible, or a physical condition that would limit the ability of the child to undergo apheresis catheter placement (if necessary) and/or the apheresis procedure\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 365 Days\nMust have maximum age of 30 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Patients with INRG stage L2 tumors without amplification of MYCN regardless of tumor histology (may meet criteria for high risk classification but are not eligible for this trial)\n* Patients with bone marrow failure syndromes\n* Patients for whom targeted radiopharmaceutical therapy would be contraindicated due to underlying medical disorders\n* Female patients who are pregnant since fetal toxicities and teratogenic effects have been noted for several of the study drugs; a pregnancy test is required for female patients of childbearing potential\n* Lactating females who plan to breastfeed their infants\n* Sexually active patients of reproductive potential who have not agreed to use an effective contraceptive method for the duration of their study participation",
