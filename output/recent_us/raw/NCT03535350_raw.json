Subjects should not be primary platinum refractory as defined by progressing during or within 1 month of upfront platinum therapy.\n5. Has measurable disease by RECIST v1.1 using radiologic assessment.\n6. Subject age is 18 years and older.\n7. Has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 or 1.\n8. Has life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks.\n9. Has adequate organ function.\n10. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 72 hours of D1 of IP.\n11. Recovery from prior anti-cancer treatments including surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy or any other anti-cancer therapy to baseline or ≤ Grade 1.\n12. Willing to consent to mandatory pre-treatment and on-treatment tumor biopsy(ies), unless there is excessive risk as determined by the investigator.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be FEMALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "Participants are excluded from the study if any of the following criteria apply:\n\n1. Prior treatment with an anti-CD47 or anti-SIRPα targeting agent or a CD40 agonist.\n2. Any anti-cancer therapy within the washout period prior to first dose (D1) of SL-172154.\n3. Concurrent chemotherapy, immunotherapy, biologic or hormonal/hormonal suppression therapy for cancer treatment is prohibited. Concurrent use of hormones for non-cancer related conditions is acceptable.\n4. Use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medication, current or within 14 days of D1 of SL-172154 treatment.\n5. Receipt of live attenuated vaccine within 28 days of D1 of IP.\n6. Active or documented history of autoimmune disease. Exceptions include controlled Type I diabetes, vitiligo, alopecia areata or hypo/hyperthyroidism.\n7. Hypersensitivity to the active drug substance or to any of the excipients for the agent to be administered or subjects with known hypersensitivity to Chinese hamster ovary cell products.\n8. Active pneumonitis (i.e. drug-induced, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, radiation-induced, etc.).\n9. Ongoing or active infection (e.g., no systemic antimicrobial therapy for treatment of infection within 5 days of D1 of IP).\n10. Symptomatic peptic ulcer disease or gastritis, active diverticulitis, other serious gastrointestinal disease associated with diarrhea within 6 months of D1 of IP.\n11. Clinically significant or uncontrolled cardiac/thromboembolic disease.\n12. Untreated central nervous system or leptomeningeal metastases.\n13. Women who are breast feeding.\n14. Psychiatric illness/social circumstances that would limit compliance with study requirements and substantially increase the risk of AEs or compromised ability to provide written informed consent.\n15.
