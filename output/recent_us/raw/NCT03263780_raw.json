Bullets, shrapnel, metalwork fragments, or other metallic material adds unnecessary risk to the patient.\n* Pregnancy. Regular clinical practice already excludes pregnant patients from gadolinium contrast.\n* Implanted medical device not described above that is not MRI-compatible.\n* Known history of severe claustrophobia.\n* Prisoners and members of other vulnerable populations will be excluded from this study. The subject selection population will not regularly include prisoners and other vulnerable population members as these populations will not provide any additional unique information to or uniquely benefit from the study.
