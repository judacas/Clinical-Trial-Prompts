Any CD33 receptor expression level > 0.01% by institute flow cytometric analysis will suffice\n* Relapsed or refractory disease, defined as:\n\n  * Any bone marrow relapse after allogeneic HSCT: subjects must be at least 1 month from HSCT at the time of screening and off immunosuppressive medication for at least 2 weeks at time of initial treatment (with the exception of low-dose steroids =< 20 mg prednisone equivalent) and have no active graft versus (vs.) host disease (GVHD)\n  * AML with no prior CR/CRi after at least 1 prior cycle of remission induction chemotherapy (i.e. cytarabine or hypomethylating based regimen(s) allowed)\n  * AML recurring after prior CR/CRi, which was achieved following at least one prior chemotherapy cycle (i.e. cytarabine or hypomethylating based regimen(s) allowed)\n* Peripheral white blood cell (WBC) counts <25,000/mcL.
