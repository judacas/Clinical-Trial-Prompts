Subjects with a test result of locally confirmed EGFR mutant obtained through a test method approved by the sponsor using either a tumor tissue and/or plasma ctDNA.

Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) and Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 3.0 ×ULN, or if there is a hepatic metastasis caused by tumor, ≤ 5.0 × ULN\n   6. *Estimated creatinine clearance calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault formula to ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73m2\n\n      * CrCl (male) = ([140 - age] × weight (kg)) / (serum creatinine (mg/dL) × 72), CrCl (female) = CrCl (male) ×0.85\n9. For women with childbearing potential\n\n   1. The serum pregnancy test result must be negative before screening and the first dose of the investigational product\n   2. Women of childbearing potential who are sexually active with a non-sterilized male partner must use at least 1 or more effective contraceptive methods from the first dose of the investigational product to 90 days after the last dose\n\n      *Progesterone hormone contraceptive inhibiting ovulation, including an oral, injectable and implant type, intrauterine device, bilateral tubal ligation, use of spermicide or condom by the male partner, etc.\n   3. Must not breastfeed during the study and up to 90 days after the last dose of the investigational product\n10. Male subjects who are sexually active with a non-sterilized female partner of childbearing potential must agree to using an effective contraceptive method (spermicide, condom, etc.) from the first dose of the investigational product to 90 days after the last dose and not donating their sperms\n\n[Exclusion Criteria]\n\n1. NSCLC with mixed squamous cell histology and tumor with histological transformation (presence of transition from NSCLC to SCLC and epithelial mesenchymal transition)\n2. For Part A, B, and Cohort 4 of Part C\n\n   - Subjects requiring steroid escalation within 28 days before start of the study due to spinal cord compression with uncontrolled symptoms or Central Nervous System (CNS) metastasis or for CNS disease treatment; patients requiring local CNS disease treatment; and subjects with leptomeningeal disease. However, these subjects may be included in the study if they are systemically asymptomatic and stable 2 weeks after gamma knife therapy or 4 weeks after whole-brain irradiation\n3. For Part Part C: all Cohorts except for Cohort 4\n\n   - Subjects without CNS metastasis\n4. Subjects who received the following treatments:\n\n   1. EGFR-TKI treatment within 7 days from the first dose of the investigational product\n   2. Systemic anticancer treatment within 14 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is the shorter period) from the first dose of the investigational product\n   3. Limited field radiation treatment within 7 days or extended field chest radiation treatment within 14 days from the first dose of the investigational product\n   4. Immunotherapy or other antibody therapy within 28 days from the first dose of the investigational product\n   5. Subjects who did not recover from a major surgery or side effects of such treatment, except for vascular access placement, within 28 days from the first dose of the investigational product as determined by the investigator *A major surgery refers to a surgery on the abdomen, pelvis, cranium or intrapleural site or local site tissue and is defined as a procedure that may cause a risk to function or recovery of an organ and tissue based on the applicable site, subject's condition, and difficulty or duration of the surgery. A major surgery generally requires hospitalization of a varying period (often 1 week) and can be conducted by a surgical professional.\n5. Subjects with the following cardiac dysfunctions or clinically significant cardiac diseases:\n\n   1. Corrected QT interval using Frederica formula (QTcF) > 470 ms\n   2. Cardiac arrhythmia that is clinically significant and uncontrolled (e.g. Type II second degree heart block or third degree heart block)\n   3. Any factors increasing the risk of QTc prolongation or arrhythmia occurrence, such as hypokalemia, congenital long QT syndrome, family history of long QT syndrome, unexplained sudden death of a family member or direct family member at the age less than 40 years, or concomitant drugs known to prolong the QT interval or cause Torsades de Pointes\n   4. Uncontrolled (persistent) hypertension: Systolic blood pressure > 180 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure > 100 mmHg\n   5. Congestive heart failure defined as New York Heart Association Class III-IV, or hospitalization due to congestive heart failure within 6 months before the first dose of the study intervention\n   6. Medical history of acute myocardial infarction or unstable angina within 6 months before screening\n6. Subjects with active malignancy other than appropriately treated basal cell cancer or squamous cell skin cancer or carcinoma in situ within 2 years before enrollment. However, those who completed all anticancer treatments at least 2 years ago and are considered previously cured at the time of enrollment can be enrolled.\n7. Subjects with evidence/past history of interstitial lung disease (ILD) or radiological pneumonia requiring steroid treatment. Subjects with prior ILD related to clinically resolved COVID-19 infection may be enrolled after discussion with and approval by the medical monitor.\n8. Subjects who are not able to swallow and keep in the body an orally administered drug and subjects who have a clinically significant gastrointestinal disorder such as major limitations to the stomach or intestine or malabsorption syndrome\n9. Subjects with other uncontrolled active infections, e.g. human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), HBV or HCV, including subjects with suspected active or latent tuberculosis (confirmed with interferon-gamma emission analysis positivity)\n\n   *The referential protocol about COVID-19/SARS-CoV2 excludes subjects with active infections mentioned above. Though SARS-CoV2 test is not required for enrollment to this protocol, it should follow the standard of the local clinical practice. Subjects testing positive for SARS-CoV2 infection or known to have asymptomatic infection or suspected to have SARS-CoV2 are excluded, but they may be rescreened according to the protocol requirements if they test negative in a subsequent test.\n10. Subjects with known sensitivity to the study drug or its related substance\n11. Subjects who have a history of drug abuse or unstable medical, mental or social conditions that may interfere with participation in the study or result interpretation\n12. Subjects considered not able to follow the protocol as determined by the investigator\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
