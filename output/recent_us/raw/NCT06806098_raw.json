    "exclusion_criteria": "4.2 PARTICIPANT EXCLUSION CRITERIA\n\nAn individual who meets any of the following appropriate criteria below will be excluded from participation in this study.\n\n1. Participant has insufficient time from prior therapy to the first dose of study treatment:\n\n   1. Less than 4 weeks for an investigational agent or investigational device\n   2. Less than 3 weeks for major surgery\n   3. Less than 2 weeks for radiation therapy\n   4. Less than 3 weeks for a cytotoxic agent\n   5. Less than 2 weeks or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter, for a targeted therapy (e.g. tyrosine kinase inhibitor)\n   6. Less than 3 weeks or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter, for an antibody-based therapy\n2. Participant has received a live vaccine or live-attenuated vaccine within 30 days before the first dose of study intervention.\n\n   Note: Please refer to Section 6.4 for information on COVID-19 vaccines.\n3. Participant has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy (in dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of study intervention.\n4. Participant has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e., with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive drugs).\n\n   Note: Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment and is allowed.\n5. Participant has an active bacterial infection requiring intravenous [IV] antibiotics at time of initiating study treatment, fungal infection, or detectable viral infection.\n6.

Participant has had an allogenic tissue/solid organ transplant.\n10. Participant has third space fluid which cannot be controlled by drainage. Note: For patients who develop or have baseline clinically significant pleural or peritoneal effusions (on the basis of symptoms or clinical examination) before or during initiation of pemetrexed therapy, consideration should be given to draining the effusion prior to dosing. However, if, in the investigator's opinion, the effusion represents progression of disease, the patient should be discontinued from study therapy.\n11. Participant has a severe or uncontrolled medical disorder that would, in the investigator's opinion, impair ability to receive study intervention, including, but not limited to:\n\n    1. Uncontrolled diabetes;\n    2. Renal disease that requires dialysis;\n    3.

Congestive heart failure (NYHA classification ≥ 3):\n\n    New York Heart Association Functional Classification Class Patient Symptoms I No limitation of physical activity. Ordinary physical activity does not cause undue fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea (shortness of breath).\n\n    II Slight limitation of physical activity. Comfortable at rest. Ordinary physical activity results in fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea (shortness of breath).\n\n    III Marked limitation of physical activity. Comfortable at rest. Less than ordinary activity causes fatigue, palpitation, or dyspnea.\n\n    IV Unable to carry on any physical activity without discomfort. Symptoms of heart failure at rest. If any physical activity is undertaken, discomfort increases.\n13. Participant has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or has required active treatment with the past 3 years.\n\n    Note: Participants with basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, organ confined prostate cancer, or carcinoma in situ, excluding carcinoma in situ of the bladder, that have undergone potentially curative therapy are not excluded.\n14.
