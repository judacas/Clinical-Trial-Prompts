    "official_title": "A Phase I-II, First-in-Human Study of SKB264 in Patients With Locally Advanced Unresectable /Metastatic Solid Tumors Who Are Refractory to Available Standard Therapies",
    "inclusion_criteria": "Patients must meet the following criteria for inclusion into the study:\n\nPhase I:\n\n1. Patients must be able to provide documented voluntary informed consent.\n2. Male or female patient aged 18-75 years.\n3. Histologically documented, incurable, locally advanced or metastatic epithelial origin malignant cancer, priority to include but not limited to the following tumor types:\n\n   Breast cancer Ovarian epithelial cancer Non-small cell lung cancer Gastric adenocarcinoma Small cell lung cancer Urothelial carcinoma Note: Confirmation of TROP2 expression by immunohistology or other means is not required, but the Sponsor will request tissue specimens from fresh or archived materials for determination of TROP2 expression.\n4. Measurable disease by CT/MRI during dose escalation.\n5. Patients should have an unresectable locally advanced or metastatic solid tumor that is refractory to standard therapies, or have no standard therapies, or standard treatment is not applicable at this stage.\n6. Granulocyte count ≥ 1.5×109/L, platelet count ≥ 100×109/L, and hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL.\n7. International normalized ratio (INR) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) ≤ 1.5×ULN.\n8. Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dL (Patients with known Gilbert disease who have serum bilirubin level ≤ 3 ×ULN may be enrolled)., aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN), with the exception of patients with hepatic metastases (ALT and AST ≤ 5 × ULN) and patients with hepatic and/or bone metastases (alkaline phosphatase ≤ 5 × ULN).\n9. Creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min calculated by Cockcroft-Gault, Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration, or Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formulas. Note that 24 hour urine collection is not required but is allowed.\n10. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status 0 or 1.\n11. For female patients of childbearing potential and male patients with partners of childbearing potential, agreement (by patient and/or partner) to use a highly effective form(s) of contraception during study treatment. Female and male patient treated with SKB264 should continue contraception use for 7 months after the last dose. Such methods include combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception, progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation together with another additional barrier method always containing a spermicide, intrauterine device (IUD), intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS), bilateral tubal occlusion or vasectomized partner (on the understanding that this is the only one partner during the whole study duration), and sexual abstinence.\n\n    * Oral contraception should always be combined with an additional contraceptive method because of a potential interaction with the study drug. The same rules are valid for male patients involved in this clinical trial if they have a partner of childbirth potential. Male patients must always use a condom.\n    * Women are excluded from birth control if they had had tubal ligation or a hysterectomy.\n12. Patients must have recovered (i.e., improvement to Grade 1 or better) from all acute toxicities from previous therapy, excluding alopecia and vitiligo.\n13. Expected survival ≥ 3 months.\n\nPhase II:\n\n1. Patients must be able to provide documented voluntary informed consent.\n2. Male or female patient aged ≥ 18 years.\n3. Histologically or cytologically documented, incurable, locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic cancer, including the following tumor types:\n\n   * Cohort 1: triple negative breast cancer (< 1% expression for estrogen receptor [ER] and progesterone receptor [PR] and HER2 negative)\n   * Cohort 2: ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer\n   * Cohort 3: non-small cell lung cancer\n   * Cohort 4: gastric adenocarcinoma or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma (HER2 negative)\n   * Cohort 6: HR+/ HER2- breast cancer (≥1% expression for ER and/or PR and HER2 negative)\n   * Cohort 7: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (including primary tumor location of oropharynx, oral cavity, hypopharynx, or larynx.

Measurable disease by CT/MRI.\n5. Patients should have an unresectable locally advanced or metastatic solid tumor that is refractory to standard therapies.\n6.
