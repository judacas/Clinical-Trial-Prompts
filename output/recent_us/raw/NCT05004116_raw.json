Patients with prior hepatitis B virus (HBV) exposure (positive HBV core antibody and/or surface antigen) are eligible if they have no detectable viral load, and are taking appropriate prophylactic antiviral therapy to prevent reactivation. Patients with history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) are eligible if they have an undetectable HCV viral load\n    * Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen are eligible for this trial\n    * No history of severe bleeding disorder such as hemophilia A, hemophilia B, von Willebrand disease, or history of spontaneous bleeding requiring blood transfusion or other medical intervention\n    * No history of stroke or intracranial hemorrhage within 6 months prior to registration\n    * No disease significantly affecting gastrointestinal function such as malabsorption syndrome, resection of the stomach or small bowel, bariatric surgery procedures, symptomatic inflammatory bowel disease, or partial or complete bowel obstruction. Patient must be able to swallow pills\n    * Potential trial participants should have recovered from major surgery\n    * No vaccination with a live vaccine within 35 days prior to registration\n    * No hypersensitivity to zanubrutinib or rituximab or any of the other ingredients of the study drugs\n    * Chronic concomitant treatment with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 is not allowed on this study. Patients on strong CYP3A4 inhibitors must discontinue the drug for 14 days prior to registration on the study.\n    * Chronic concomitant treatment with strong CYP3A4 inducers is not allowed.
