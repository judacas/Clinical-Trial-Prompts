    "inclusion_criteria": "* Documented informed consent of the participant and/or legally authorized representative. Assent, when appropriate, will be obtained per institutional guidelines. Note: For research participants who do not speak English, a short form consent may be used with a COH certified interpreter/translator to proceed with screening and leukapheresis, while the request for a translated main consent is processed. However, the research participant is allowed to proceed with surgery/rickham placement and CAR T cell infusion only after the translated main consent form is signed.\n* Agreement to allow the use of archival tissue from diagnostic tumor biopsies. If unavailable, exceptions may be granted with study principal investigator (PI) approval\n* Karnofsky performance status (KPS) >= 60%\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) =< 2\n* Life expectancy >= 4 weeks\n* Participant has a prior histologically-confirmed diagnosis of a grade IV glioblastoma, or has a prior histologically-confirmed diagnosis of a grade II or III malignant brain tumors and now has radiographic progression consistent with a grade IV glioblastoma\n* Relapsed disease: radiographic evidence of recurrence/progression of measurable disease after standard therapy, and >= 12 weeks after completion of front-line radiation therapy\n* City of Hope (COH) Clinical Pathology confirms matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)2+ tumor expression by immunohistochemistry (>= 20% moderate/high MMP2 [2+/3+])\n* No known contraindications to leukapheresis, steroids, or tocilizumab\n* White blood cell (WBC) > 2000 /dl (or absolute neutrophil count [ANC] >= 1,000/mm^3) (to be performed within 14 days prior to leukapheresis unless otherwise stated)\n* Platelets >= 75,000/mm^3 (to be performed within 14 days prior to leukapheresis unless otherwise stated)\n* Hemoglobin >= 8 g/dl (to be performed within 14 days prior to leukapheresis unless otherwise stated)\n* Total bilirubin =< 1.5 upper limit of normal (ULN) (to be performed within 14 days prior to leukapheresis unless otherwise stated)\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) =< 2.5 x ULN (to be performed within 14 days prior to leukapheresis unless otherwise stated)\n* Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) =< 2.5 x ULN (to be performed within 14 days prior to leukapheresis unless otherwise stated)\n* Serum creatinine =< 1.6 mg/dL (to be performed within 14 days prior to leukapheresis unless otherwise stated)\n* Oxygen (O2) saturation >= 95% on room air (to be performed within 14 days prior to leukapheresis unless otherwise stated)\n* Seronegative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antigen (Ag)/antibody (Ab) combo (to be performed within 14 days prior to leukapheresis unless otherwise stated)\n* Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP): negative urine or serum pregnancy test (to be performed within 14 days prior to leukapheresis unless otherwise stated)\n\n  * If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required\n* Agreement by females and males of childbearing potential* to use an effective method of birth control or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course of the study through at least 3 months after the last dose of CAR T cells\n\n  * Childbearing potential defined as not being surgically sterilized (men and women) or have not been free from menses for > 1 year (women only)\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Prior and concomitant therapies\n* Owing to higher frequency of wound-related complications, participants who are within 3 months of having received prior bevacizumab therapy at the time of enrollment are excluded.\n* Participant has not yet recovered from toxicities of prior therapy\n* Other illnesses or conditions\n* Uncontrolled seizure activity and/or clinically evident progressive encephalopathy\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to study agent\n* Active diarrhea\n* Clinically significant uncontrolled illness\n* Active infection requiring antibiotics\n* Known history of immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection\n* Other active malignancy\n* Females only: Pregnant or breastfeeding\n* Any other condition that would, in the investigator's judgment, contraindicate the subject's participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns with clinical study procedures\n* Noncompliance\n* Prospective participants who, in the opinion of the investigator, may not be able to comply with all study procedures (including compliance issues related to feasibility/logistics)",
