    "inclusion_criteria": "Parts 1, 2, 3 and 4\n\nPatients must meet all the following criteria to be eligible to participate in the study:\n\n1. Are ≥18 years old males or females.\n2. Are capable of understanding and have voluntarily signed the informed consent document and willing to comply with study requirements.\n3. Have histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of metastatic or advanced-stage solid tumor that is refractory to standard therapy (For Part 1 only; see modified inclusion criteria #13, 15 and 18 for Parts 2, 3, and 4, respectively).\n4. Have measurable disease according to the RECIST 1.1.\n5. Have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1.\n6. Have an expected survival of at least 3 months.\n7. Have a negative pregnancy test result confirmed by a serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-HCG) test (for women of childbearing potential [WOCBP]) performed at Screening and have a negative pregnancy urine test result on Cycle 1, Day 1. This is not applicable to patients who are unable to become pregnant, including those with bilateral oophorectomy, salpingectomy, tubal ligation and/or hysterectomy or postmenopausal or those that have had definitive radiation therapy to the pelvis. WOCBP are considered postmenopausal if 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea, or 6 months of spontaneous amenorrhea with serum follicle-stimulating hormone levels > 40 mIU/mL, or 6 weeks postsurgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy.\n8. WOCBP who are sexually active with a non-sterilized male partner (sterilized males should be ≥6 months post vasectomy and have obtained documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate) should agree to remain abstinent (refrain from sexual intercourse of any kind) or use 2 effective methods of contraception, including at least 1 method with a failure rate of <1% per year, during the treatment period and for at least 6 months for both female and male patients, following the last dose of TH1902. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, symptothermal, and post-ovulation), withdrawal, spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea are not acceptable methods of contraception. Female and male condoms should not be used together.\n\n   • Effective contraceptive measures include the following:\n   * Intrauterine device (e.g., IUD) or intrauterine system plus one barrier method.\n   * Oral, intravaginal, or transdermal combined (estrogen and progestogen) hormonal contraceptive associated with the inhibition of ovulation plus one barrier method.\n   * Oral, implantable, or injectable progestogen-only hormonal contraceptive associated with the inhibition of ovulation plus one barrier method.\n   * Bilateral tubal occlusion at least 6 weeks before study drug administration.\n   * Sterilization of male partner (at least 6 months prior to screening). For WOCBP in on the study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient and must have obtained documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate.\n   * True sexual abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the study patient.\n   * Effective barrier methods are male or female condoms, diaphragms, and spermicides.\n9. WOCBP must agree to ongoing pregnancy testing during the course of the study and must agree not to donate ova during and after treatment with TH1902. Male patients must refrain from donating sperm during the study and for at least 6 months following the last dose of TH1902.\n10. Male patients with WOCBP partners must agree to remain abstinent (refrain from sexual intercourse of any kind) or use a condom (latex condom is recommended) during the treatment period and for at least 6 months after the last dose of TH1902 to avoid exposing the embryo, if the vasectomy has been performed less than 6 months or documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate has not been obtained. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, symptothermal, and post-ovulation,), withdrawal, spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea are not acceptable methods of contraception. Female and male condoms should not be used together.\n11. Patients with known Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)/Hepatitis B (HBV)/Hepatitis C (HCV) will be allowed to enter the study provided the following criteria are met:\n\n    * Patients with HIV infection must have CD4+ T-cell (CD4+) counts ≥ 350 cells/µL.\n    * The following eligibility criteria are for patients with evidence of chronic HBV infection or patients with history of chronic HCV or who are virologically suppressed on HCV treatment:\n\n      * Liver-related laboratory eligibility criteria should be the same as that for the general population.\n      * Exceptions: Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and bilirubin criteria may be less stringent in patients with cancers such as hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma in whom hepatic function based on Child-Pugh score should be used.\n      * Patients with chronic HBV infection with active disease who meet the criteria for anti-HBV therapy should be on a suppressive antiviral therapy prior to initiation of cancer therapy.\n      * Patients on concurrent HCV treatments must have HCV below the limit of quantification.\n      * Patients with untreated and stable HCV can be enrolled provided that the patient is not at risk for hepatic decompensation.\n12.
