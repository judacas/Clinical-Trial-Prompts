    "exclusion_criteria": "* Active serious infection not controlled by oral or intravenous antibiotics\n* Known active hepatitis B. Patients with chronic hepatitis B who are on appropriate viral suppressive therapy may be allowed after discussion with the principal investigator (PI)\n* History of acute pancreatitis within 1 year of study or history of chronic pancreatitis\n* History of alcohol abuse\n* Uncontrolled hypertriglyceridemia\n* Active secondary malignancy other than skin cancer (e.g., basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma) that in the investigator's opinion will shorten survival to less than 1 year\n* Active grade III-V cardiac failure as defined by the New York Heart Association criteria\n* Uncontrolled, or active cardiovascular disease, specifically including, but not restricted to: myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, or revascularization within 3 months; unstable angina or transient ischemic attack; congestive heart failure prior to enrollment, or left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than lower limit of normal per local institutional standards prior to enrollment; diagnosed or suspected congenital long QT syndrome; clinically significant atrial or ventricular arrhythmias as determined by the treating physician; prolonged corrected QT (QTc) interval on pre-entry electrocardiogram (> 470 msec) unless corrected after electrolyte replacement. or approved by cardiologist; Significant venous or arterial thromboembolism including deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. Patients with a history of treated prior superficial or catheter associated phlebitis will not be considered as significant embolism and after discussion with principal investigator (PI) will not be excluded from eligibility.
