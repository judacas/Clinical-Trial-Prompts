    "official_title": "A Phase 1 Study of NKX101, an Activating Chimeric Receptor Natural Killer Cell Therapy, in Subjects With Hematological Malignancies or Dysplasias",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* General:\n\n  * ECOG performance status ≤2\n* Disease related:\n\n  * For AML subjects:\n\n    * Previously treated relapsed/refractory AML, including subjects with MRD+ disease\n    * Received at most 3 lines of previous anti-leukemia therapy\n    * For subjects with targetable fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3)-mutated or isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)1/2 mutated disease, subjects must have received at least 1 prior respective targeted therapy and may receive up to 4 lines of prior therapy\n    * White blood cell count of ≤25 × 10^9/L\n    * For groups receiving NKX101 after lymphodepletion with fludarabine/cyclophosphamide +/- decitabine: Disease localized to the bone marrow, as evidenced by ≤ 5% peripheral blasts and no evidence of extramedullary disease\n    * For groups receiving NKX101 after lymphodepletion with fludarabine/ cyclophosphamide +/- decitabine, group receiving NKX101 after lymphodepletion with fludarabine/ara-C: Additional subjects with specifically high-risk genetic mutations may be enrolled. High risk genetic mutation per ELN 2022 should be evaluated as per local assay and discussed with the Sponsor prior to study entry\n    * For groups receiving NKX101 after lymphodepletion with fludarabine/cyclophosphamide +/- decitabine, group receiving NKX101 after lymphodepletion with fludarabine/ara-C: Additional subjects who have relapsed following HCT may be enrolled.\n  * For MDS subjects:\n\n    * Intermediate-, high-, or very high-risk MDS\n    * Previously treated relapsed/refractory MDS\n    * Received at least 1 and at most 3 lines of previous standard anti-MDS therapy\n    * For groups receiving NKX101 after lymphodepletion with fludarabine/ cyclophosphamide +/- decitabine: Additional subjects with specifically high-risk disease may be enrolled. High-risk genetic mutation should be evaluated as per local assay\n    * For group receiving lymphodepletion with fludarabine/cyclophosphamide +/- decitabine and NKX101: Additional subjects who have relapsed following HCT may be enrolled.\n* Adequate Organ Function\n* Platelet count ≥30,000/uL (platelet transfusions acceptable)\n* Other:\n\n  * Signed informed consent\n  * Agree to use an effective barrier method of birth control\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Disease related:\n\n  * Acute promyelocytic leukemia with t(15;17) (q22;q12); or abnormal promyelocytic leukemia/retinoic acid receptor alpha (APML-RARA) and AML arising from chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML)\n  * Evidence of leukemic meningitis or known active central nervous system disease\n  * Peripheral leukocytosis with ≥ 20,000 blasts/μL or other evidence of rapidly progressive disease that would preclude subject from completing at least 1 cycle of treatment\n  * Use of any anti-AML/MDS chemotherapeutic or targeted small molecule drug within protocol specified window prior to the first dose of NKX101\n  * Presence of residual non-hematologic toxicity from prior therapies that has not resolved to ≤ Grade 1\n  * Any hematopoietic cell transplantation within 16 weeks\n* Other comorbid conditions and concomitant medications prohibited as per study protocol\n* Other:\n\n  * Pregnant or lactating female",
