Histologically confirmed recurrent epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer for which there is no known or established treatment available with curative intent.\n3. Have demonstrated progressive disease while taking a licensed PARP inhibitor as a previous therapy or within 6 months of completing PARP inhibitor therapy. Response to prior PARPi is not required. However, there must be documented evidence of progression prior to study entry.\n4. Prior PARP therapy could have been administered as either treatment for recurrent disease or as maintenance following prior treatment.\n5. At least one measurable lesion according to RECIST v1.1.\n6. Adequate archived primary or metastatic tumor tissue collected before the prior PARP therapy.\n7. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS) score of 0-1 within 28 days of study entry.\n8.

Are germline or somatic BRCA mutant or HRD positive by a licensed test prior to enrollment.\n4. Patient must have demonstrated clinical benefit from prior PARPi treatment. Clinical benefit after >1 line of chemotherapy is defined as a minimum duration of continuous treatment with the PARP inhibitor of 6 months in the treatment or maintenance setting (which may or may not be associated with response by CA-125 or imaging). If the PARP inhibitor is received as maintenance following first-line chemotherapy, the minimum duration of continuous treatment with the PARP inhibitor is 12 months\n5.

Documented evidence of progression prior to study entry.\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\n1. Prior Treatment:\n\n   1. PARP inhibitor: Most oral PARP inhibitors (the immediate prior therapy) have a half- life for which 5 half-lives is ≤21 days. Thus, a minimum of 10 days between termination of the prior treatment and administration of olaparib and/or AZD1775 treatment is required. In the event a PARP inhibitor has a longer half-life where 5 half-lives are ≥ 21 days, treatment of olaparib and/or AZD1775 should not begin for 5 half-lives or at least 21 days, whichever is shorter.\n   2.

The minimum washout period for immunotherapy is 42 days. Palliative radiotherapy must have been completed 21or more days before Cycle 1 Day 1 (with the exception of patients receiving radiation to more than 30% of the bone marrow or with a wide field of radiation within 4 weeks of the first dose of study treatment).

Note: Patient may not have a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube or be receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Patient has refractory nausea and vomiting, chronic gastrointestinal diseases or previous significant bowel resection, with clinically significant sequelae that would preclude adequate absorption of the study medication.\n5.
