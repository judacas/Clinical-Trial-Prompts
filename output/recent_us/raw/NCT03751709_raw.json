    "official_title": "A Randomized Trial to Minimize Non-Response to Aerobic Training in Post-Menopausal Women With Early Stage Breast Cancer",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Aged 21-80 years\n* Female\n* Surgically resected early stage (I-III) primary breast cancer\n* Post-menopausal, defined as one of the following:\n\n  * Age ≥ 45 with no menses for at least 2 years\n  * Chemically and/or surgically induced menopause through ovarian suppression, as determined by the primary oncologist\n  * Estradiol level of ≤30 pg/mL\n* An interval of at least one year, but no more than five years, following the full completion of definitive therapy for malignant disease. Definitive therapy is defined as:\n\n  * Surgery plus radiation\n  * Surgery plus chemotherapy\n  * Surgery plus trastuzumab\n* Exercise intolerance (i.e., patients must have a VO2peak below the predicted for active age and sex-matched individuals. (+/- the technical error of 1.32 mL/kg/min)].\n\nNote: Normative values are available up to 80 years of age)\n\n* Able to complete an acceptable baseline CPET, in the absence of high-risk ECG findings or other inappropriate response to exercise as determined by the PI, as defined by any of the following criteria:\n\n  * Achieving a plateau in oxygen consumption, concurrent with an increase in power output;\n  * A respiratory exchange ratio ≥ 1.10;\n  * Attainment of maximal predicted heart rate (HRmax) (i.e., within 10 bpm of age-predicted HRmax [HRmax = 220-Age[years]);\n  * Volitional exhaustion, as measured by a rating of perceived exertion (RPE) ≥ 18 on the BORG scale\n* Willingness to comply with all study-related procedures.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be FEMALE\nMust have minimum age of 21 Years\nMust have maximum age of 80 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Any of the following absolute contraindications to cardiopulmonary exercise testing:\n\n  * Acute myocardial infarction within 3-5 days of any planned study procedures\n  * Unstable angina\n  * Uncontrolled arrhythmia causing symptoms or hemodynamic compromise\n  * Recurrent syncope\n  * Active endocarditis\n  * Acute myocarditis or pericarditis\n  * Symptomatic severe aortic stenosis\n  * Uncontrolled heart failure\n  * Acute pulmonary embolus or pulmonary infarction within 3 months of any planned study procedures\n  * Thrombosis of lower extremities\n  * Suspected dissecting aneurysm\n  * Uncontrolled asthma\n  * Pulmonary edema\n  * Respiratory failure\n  * Acute non-cardiopulmonary disorders that may affect exercise performance or be aggravated by exercise (e.g., infection, renal failure, thyrotoxicosis)\n* Presence of any other concurrent, actively treated malignancy\n* History of any other malignancy treated within the past 3 years (other than non-melanoma skin cancer)\n* Presence of distant metastatic disease (i.e., stage IV)\n* Room air desaturation at rest ≤ 85%\n* Mental impairment leading to inability to cooperate.\n* Any other condition or intercurrent illness that, in the opinion of the investigator, makes the participant a poor candidate for the trial.",
