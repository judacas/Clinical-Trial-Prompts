>= 150 days after TBI, craniospinal XRT or if radiation to >= 50% of the pelvis; >= 42 days if other substantial bone marrow (BM) radiation; Note: Radiation may not be delivered to \"measurable disease\" tumor site(s) being used to follow response to subprotocol treatment\n  * Radiopharmaceutical therapy (e.g., radiolabeled antibody, 131I-MIBG): >= 42 days after systemically administered radiopharmaceutical therapy\n  * Patients must not have had prior exposure to tazemetostat or other inhibitor(s) of EZH2\n* For patients with solid tumors without known bone marrow involvement:\n\n  * Peripheral absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >= 1000/mm^3\n  * Platelet count >= 100,000/mm^3 (transfusion independent, defined as not receiving platelet transfusions for at least 7 days prior to enrollment)\n  * Hemoglobin >= 8.0 g/dL at baseline (may receive red blood cell [RBC] transfusions)\n* Patients with known bone marrow metastatic disease will be eligible for study provided they meet the blood counts (may receive transfusions provided they are not known to be refractory to red cell or platelet transfusions); these patients will not be evaluable for hematologic toxicity\n* Creatinine clearance or radioisotope glomerular filtration rate (GFR) >= 70 ml/min/1.73 m^2 or a serum creatinine based on age/gender as follows:\n\n  * Age 1 to < 2 years: male: 0.6 mg/dL;
