    "official_title": "A Phase 2/3 Multi-center Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Blinatumomab in Subjects With Relapsed/Refractory Aggressive B-Cell Non Hodgkin Lymphoma",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Biopsy proven aggressive B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (B-NHL), including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) not otherwise specified (NOS), follicular lymphoma Grade 3B, PMBCL, T-cell rich B-cell lymphoma, or DLBCL that represents transformation of indolent non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL), (including follicular, marginal zone, and lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma) excluding chronic lymphocytic leukemia or Hodgkin Lymphoma. The following histologies are not eligible:\n\n  * Lymphoblastic lymphoma\n  * Burkitt lymphoma\n  * Mantle cell lymphoma Any histologies not specifically mentioned must be discussed with medical monitor.\n* Refractory (no prior CR/CMR) or relapsed (prior CMR) following front line treatment of standard multiagent chemotherapy containing an anthracycline AND an approved anti-CD20 agent. For subjects with refractory disease and who have received radiotherapy, PET positivity should be demonstrated no less than 6 weeks after the last dose of radiotherapy\n* Biopsy proven confirmation of relapsed disease.\n* Received a minimum of 2 cycles of standard of care platinum-based chemotherapy in the S1 setting and had a response of progressive metabolic disease (PMD), no metabolic response (NMR), partial metabolic response (PMR) as centrally assessed by PET-/ CT scan or received at least 1 cycle of S1 chemotherapy and had evidence of PMD as centrally assessed. A pre-salvage scan is required to be submitted to the central reader if a subject had only 1 cycle of pre-salvage chemotherapy.\n* Radiographically measurable disease with a demarcated nodal lesion at least 1.5 cm in its largest dimension or a target extranodal lesion at least 1.0 cm in its largest dimension\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status less than or equal to 2\n* Intention to proceed to high dose chemotherapy (HDT) and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT)\n* Laboratory parameters:\n\nHematology:\n\n* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.0 x 10^9/L\n* Platelets ≥ 75 x 10^9/L\n\nChemistry:\n\n* Creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) < 3X upper limit of normal (ULN)\n* Total bilirubin (TBL) < 2x ULN (unless Gilbert's disease or if liver involvement with lymphoma)\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* CMR following S1 chemotherapy\n* Treatment within 30 days prior to randomization with another investigational device or drug study (ies).\n* Prior anti-CD19-directed therapies\n* Prior HDT with autologous HSCT\n* Prior allogeneic HSCT\n* Clinically relevant central nervous system (CNS) pathology such as epilepsy, paresis, aphasia, stroke, severe brain injury, dementia, Parkinson's disease, cerebellar disease, organic brain syndrome, or psychosis\n* Evidence of CNS involvement by NHL\n* Known infection with human immunodeficiency virus or chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (hepatitis B surface antigen positive) or hepatitis C virus (anti hepatitis C virus positive)\n* History of malignancy other than B-NHL within the past 3 years with the exception of:\n\n  * Malignancy treated with curative intent and with no known active disease present for ≥ 3 years before enrollment\n  * Adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer or lentigo maligna\n  * Adequately treated cervical carcinoma in situ\n  * Adequately treated breast ductal carcinoma in situ\n  * Prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia without evidence of prostate cancer\n  * Adequately treated urothelial papillary non-invasive carcinoma or carcinoma in situ\n* Known sensitivity to immunoglobulins or any of the components to be administered during dosing.\n* Subject likely to not be available to complete all protocol-required study visits or procedures, and/or to comply with all required procedures.\n* History or evidence of any other clinically significant disorder, condition or disease (with the exception of those outlined above) that would pose a risk to subject safety or interfere with the study evaluation, procedures or completion.\n* Female subjects who are pregnant or breastfeeding or planning to become pregnant or breastfeed, or of childbearing potential unwilling to use an effective method of contraception while receiving, and for an additional 48 hours after the last dose of blinatumomab.",
