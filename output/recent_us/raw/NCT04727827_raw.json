At the time of diagnosis or recurrence, all tumors must have histologic verification of one of the following:\n\n  * Medulloblastoma\n  * Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)\n  * Anaplastic astrocytoma\n  * High-grade astrocytoma, NOS\n  * Anaplastic oligodendroglioma\n  * Anaplastic ependymoma (WHO Grade III)\n  * Ependymoma (WHO Grade II)\n\nDiffuse Intrinsic Pontine Gliomas (DIPG) Patients:\n\nPatients with newly diagnosed diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPGs), defined as tumors with a pontine epicenter and diffuse involvement of 2/3 or more of the pons, are eligible without histologic confirmation and will proceed directly to enrollment without screening.\n\n• TUMOR TISSUE- Patients must provide tumor tissue (3 unstained slides or paraffin block) to determine their survivin expression status.\n\nDemonstration of survivin expression of at least 1% on tumor tissue by immunohistochemistry is required and must be performed in the central laboratory at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center (RPCCC) to confirm eligibility.\n\n* Age: Patients must be ≥ 1 year of age and ≤ 21 years of age at the time of screening.\n* Screening Consent: Participant is willing to sign a screening consent. The screening consent is to be obtained according to institutional guidelines. Assent, when appropriate, will be obtained according to institutional guidelines.\n* Potential Eligibility for Study Enrollment: Patients screened for this trial should be expected to meet the criteria for treatment.\n\nEnrollment Inclusion Criteria:\n\n• DIAGNOSIS: Patients with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of a primary CNS tumor that is progressive or recurrent defined as progression in any known residual tumor, or the appearance of one or more new lesions, or new cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) positivity for malignant cells, after having failed standard therapy. At the time of diagnosis or recurrence, all tumors must have histologic verification of one of the following:\n\n* Medulloblastoma\n* Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)\n* Anaplastic astrocytoma\n* High-grade astrocytoma, NOS\n* Anaplastic oligodendroglioma\n* Anaplastic ependymoma (WHO Grade III)\n* Ependymoma (WHO Grade II)\n\nPatients with newly diagnosed DIPG: Patients with diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPGs) will be eligible 14 to 56 days post-completion of radiation therapy if they do not have any evidence of progression.\n\n* Patients with a typical DIPG on MR imaging, defined as a tumor with a pontine epicenter and diffuse involvement of more than 2/3 of the pons, are eligible without histologic confirmation.\n\n  o Note: Patients with typical DIPG who undergo a biopsy are eligible provided the tumor is a diffuse glioma WHO Grade II-IV with OR without H3 K27M mutation.\n* Patients with pontine lesions that do not meet these MR imaging criteria will be eligible if there is histologic confirmation of diffuse glioma WHO Grade II-IV with H3 K27M mutation.\n* DEMONSTRATION OF SURVIVIN EXPRESSION: For patients with relapsed or progressive medulloblastoma, HGG, or ependymoma, demonstration of survivin expression as assessed after screening consent/assent of at least 1% on tumor tissue by immunohistochemistry (ICH) is required and must have been performed in the central laboratory at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center (RPCCC) to confirm eligibility.
