History of Crohn's Disease, ulcerative colitis, or ataxia telangiectasia, current gross haematuria, or current urinary catheter\n5. Subjects with ongoing urinary tract infection, prostate abscess, prostatitis, or neurogenic bladder\n6. Prior significant rectal surgery (haemorrhoidectomy is acceptable)\n7. Prior invasive malignancy unless disease free for a minimum of 3 years. Exceptions to this requirement include adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer or lentigo maligna or carcinoma in situ without evidence of disease\n8. Hip prosthesis\n9. Medical contraindication to undergo contrast-enhanced angiography, CT scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or arterial catheterization, or known history of hypersensitivity reactions to iodinated and gadolinium-based contrast product\n10. Angiographic exclusion criteria:\n\n    * a. Perfusion to tissues outside the Planning Target Volume (PTV) that cannot be corrected by placement of the catheter distal to collateral vessels or the application of standard angiographic techniques, such as coil embolization\n    * b. Type V prostatic artery origin on either side",
