If the patient is currently receiving therapy without progression, the clinician must have assessed that the current therapy is no longer benefitting the patient, or that the patient is not tolerating the therapy. Patients can be screened on ADC MATCH if they are on first-line treatment and expected to need a treatment change within 3 months, and ADC MATCH is felt to be appropriate next line therapy OR\n  * Patients with disease for which no standard treatment exists that has been shown to confer benefit OR\n  * Patients who are willing to forego standard therapies known to confer benefit\n\n    * NOTE: Patients can be on therapy at the time of initiating the Screening Protocol if the patient is interested in treatment on ADC MATCH upon progression, and the physician deems this appropriate\n* Patient must have undergone RNA testing in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA) environment.
