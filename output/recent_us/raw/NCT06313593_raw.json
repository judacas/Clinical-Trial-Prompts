Documented progressive metastatic CRPC based on Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3) criteria, which includes at least one of the following criteria:\n\n   * PSA progression\n   * Objective radiographic progression in soft tissue\n   * New bone lesions\n3. ECOG performance status of 0-2\n4. Have serum testosterone ≤ 50 ng/dL. Subjects must continue primary androgen deprivation with an LHRH/GnRH analogue (agonist/antagonist) if they have not undergone orchiectomy\n5. Have previously been treated with at least one of the following in any disease state:\n\n   * Androgen receptor signaling inhibitor (such as enzalutamide)\n   * CYP 17 inhibitor (such as abiraterone acetate)\n6.

Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:\n\n   * Absolute neutrophil count: ≥ 2,000 cells/mm3\n   * Hemoglobin: ≥9 g/dL\n   * Platelet count: ≥150 x 10^3/ microliter\n   * Serum creatinine: ≤1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) or calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2 by Cockcroft-Gault\n   * Serum total bilirubin: ≤1.5 x ULN (unless due to Gilbert's Syndrome in which case direct bilirubin must be normal)\n   * Serum AST and ALT ≤3 x ULN in absence of liver metastases; < 5x ULN if due to liver metastases (in both circumstances bilirubin must meet entry criteria)\n9. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document\n10. In the opinion of the investigator, history of clinical benefit with treatment using PSMA-TRT and no dose-limiting toxicity.

Use of investigational drugs ≤4 weeks or <5 half-lives of Cycle 1, Day 1 or current enrollment in investigational oncology drug or device study\n3. Prior systemic bone-seeking beta-emitting radioisotopes. Prior radium-223 is allowed provided last dose was at least 12 weeks prior to C1D1 on this protocol\n4. History of deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolus within 1 month of C1D1\n5. Other serious illness(es) involving the cardiac, respiratory, CNS, renal, hepatic or hematological organ systems which might preclude completion of this study or interfere with determination of causality of any adverse effects experienced in this study\n6. Radiation therapy ≤4 weeks of Day 1 Cycle 1\n7. Having partners of childbearing potential and not willing to use a method of birth control deemed acceptable by the principle investigator and chairperson during the study and for 1 month after last study drug administration\n8.
