Has a history confirming nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) cirrhosis, with at least one of the following:\n\n   * There is a historical liver biopsy showing cirrhosis with steatohepatitis. There is no evidence for a competing etiology for the cirrhosis.\n   * There is a historical liver biopsy showing steatohepatitis, and there is evidence of cirrhosis from clinical or imaging data or a second liver biopsy showing cirrhosis without all features of NASH (as the histological NASH lesions may have burnt out). There is no evidence for a competing etiology. There is at least 1 co-existing metabolic comorbidity at Screening: obesity (with either body mass index [BMI] ≥30 kg/m2 or waist circumference ≥102 cm [40 in, men] or ≥88 cm [35 in, women], or by ethnically appropriate cutpoints); hypertension (either on anti hypertensive drug therapy for at least 1 year or systolic/diastolic blood pressure (BP) >140/80 mm Hg); Type 2 diabetes (glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c] ≥6.5%, or on anti-diabetic medication for at least 1 year); or dyslipidemia (triglycerides ≥150 mg/dL or on drug therapy for hypertriglyceridemia for at least 6 months; high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ≤40 mg/dL [men] or ≤50 mg/dL [women]) to corroborate a diagnosis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).\n   * There is a historical liver biopsy showing cirrhosis with steatosis but not steatohepatitis. There is no evidence for a competing etiology. There are at least 2 co-existing (or history of) metabolic comorbidities (with obesity or diabetes being one of them) to corroborate a diagnosis of NAFLD.\n   * There is a historical liver biopsy showing steatosis but now with cirrhosis either by clinical examination, imaging, or biopsy. If there is a current biopsy, it does not show evidence of steatosis or steatohepatitis as histological lesions may have burned out. There is no evidence for a competing etiology. There are at least 2 co existing (or history of) metabolic comorbidities (with obesity or diabetes being one of them) to corroborate a diagnosis of NAFLD.\n   * Patient with cirrhosis with current or previous imaging showing steatosis. There is no liver histology available. There is no evidence for a competing etiology. There are at least two co-existing or history of metabolic comorbidities with obesity or diabetes being one of them to corroborate a diagnosis of NAFLD.\n   * For patients not meeting the above mentioned criteria, a screening liver biopsy is necessary.\n\n   Note: All liver biopsy blocks and/or slides for eligibility assessments (including those from historical biopsies) will be reviewed by the central study pathologist while the subject is in Screening. Results from the central study pathologist must be available before the subject is randomized.\n5. Absence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by valid imaging (eg, ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI) within 6 months prior to randomization. If no such imaging result is available, then ultrasound imaging should be performed as part of standard of care.\n6.

Is not pregnant and must have a negative serum pregnancy test result prior to randomization.\n10. Is of non-childbearing potential or if a fertile man or woman participating in heterosexual relations, agrees to use two acceptable means of contraception (ie, 2 effective methods of contraception, one of which must be a physical barrier method [eg, male or female condom, diaphragm] when combined with a highly effective method of contraception [ie, a method with a failure rate of <1% per year when used consistently and correctly]) throughout his/her participation in this study and for 90 days after discontinuation of study treatment.\n\n    Highly effective forms of contraception include:\n    * combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (such as oral, intravaginal, transdermal) methods\n    * progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (such as oral, injectable, implantable)\n    * hormone-releasing intrauterine system (IUS)\n    * intrauterine device (IUD)\n    * bilateral tubal occlusion\n    * a vasectomized partner, provided that partner is the sole sexual partner of the women of childbearing potential trial participant and that the vasectomized partner has received medical assessment of the surgical success\n    * sexual abstinence (ie, a refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of the clinical trial, if it is the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject).\n\n    Surgically sterile males and females are not required to use contraception provided they have been considered surgically sterile for at least 6 months. Surgical sterility includes history of surgically successful vasectomy, hysterectomy, or bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Postmenopausal women who have been amenorrheic for at least 2 years at the time of Screening will be considered sterile.\n11. If a lactating woman, agrees to discontinue nursing before the start of study treatment and refrain from nursing until 90 days after the last dose of study treatment.\n12. If a man, agrees to refrain from sperm donation throughout the study period and for a period of 90 days following the last dose of investigational medicinal product (IMP).

    "exclusion_criteria": "Subjects meeting any of the following criteria will be excluded from the study:\n\n1.

If a transaminase level at SV2 is >33% different from the level at SV1, then additional measurements should be performed at Screening Visit 3 (SV3). In such cases, the baseline transaminase levels will be established for subjects using the mean value of 4 evaluations [ie, at SV1, SV2, SV3, and Baseline (ie, pre-dose during Visit 1)].\n   * serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) > 2 × ULN\n   * mean platelet count < 50,000/mm3\n   * total bilirubin ≥ 2.0 mg/dL (subjects with a documented history of Gilbert's syndrome can be enrolled if the direct bilirubin is within normal reference range)\n   * model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score ≥12\n   * Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) Score ≥7 Note: Following Phase 2b, subjects with CTP scores ≥7 may be enrolled if recommended* by the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) and approved by the Trial Steering Committee (TSC), based on the planned interim analysis (IA).
