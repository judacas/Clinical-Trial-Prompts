    "official_title": "Phase II Study Evaluating Maintenance in Light Chain Amyloidosis (EMILIA)",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Age >= 18 years\n* Histological confirmation of AL amyloidosis with adequate typing (mass spectrometry, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, immunogold)\n* AL amyloidosis with organ disease requiring therapy\n\n  * NOTE: Disease requiring therapy is referred to the time of diagnosis. There are no limitations in baseline measurable disease parameters\n* Patients must have monoclonal protein studies (serum free light chain assay, serum immunofixation or serum MASS-FIX) obtained at time of diagnosis before induction therapy initiated and available for review to be enrolled.\n\n  * NOTE: Patients are allowed to participate in this study if urine electrophoresis immunofixation study was not done at time of diagnosis or cannot be obtained\n* Patients must have completed 6 cycles of daratumumab (Dara)-CyBorD-based induction treatment =< 84 days prior to registration\n* Patients must have achieved a hematological complete response (CR) (irrespective of organ response achievement) or hematological very good partial response (VGPR) (irrespective of organ response achievement) or hematological low-difference in involved and uninvolved free light chain (dFLC) partial response (PR) (irrespective of organ response achievement) or hematological PR with at least one organ response after receiving Dara-CyBorD-based induction.\n\n  * NOTE: Patients with baseline dFLC < 5 mg/dL, must have achieved hematological CR, or dFLC < 1 mg/dL or achieved organ response prior to randomization\n* Patients in whom bortezomib and/or cyclophosphamide were omitted from induction due to toxicity concerns or adverse effects are allowed. Patients must receive at least daratumumab and dexamethasone at induction to qualify for the study\n\n  * NOTE: Dexamethasone use does not need to be carried to end of induction for eligibility consideration\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 0, 1, 2 or 3\n* Hemoglobin >= 8.0 g/dL (obtained =< 28 days prior to registration)\n* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >= 1000/mm^3 (obtained =< 28 days prior to registration)\n* Platelet count >= 50,000/mm^3 (obtained =< 28 days prior to registration)\n* Negative pregnancy test done =< 7 days prior to registration, for persons of childbearing potential only.\n\n  * NOTE: If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required\n* Provide written informed consent\n\n  * NOTE: Informed consent required =< 90 days prior registration\n* Ability to complete questionnaire(s) by themselves or with assistance\n* Willing to return to enrolling institution for follow-up (during the active monitoring phase of the study)\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Any of the following because this study involves an agent that has possible genotoxic, mutagenic and teratogenic effects:\n\n  * Pregnant persons\n  * Nursing persons\n  * Persons of childbearing potential (and persons able to father a child) who are unwilling to employ adequate contraception\n* Received >1 cycle of daratumumab maintenance after end of induction therapy and prior to registration\n* Multiple myeloma at time of diagnosis as defined by any of the following:\n\n  * Hypercalcemia: Serum calcium > 1 mg/dL higher than upper limit of normal or > 11 mg/dL\n  * Renal insufficiency: Creatinine clearance < 40 mL per min or serum creatinine > 2 mg/dL attributed to high circulating light chains (i.e. cast nephropathy) or hypercalcemia\n  * Anemia: Hemoglobin > 2 g/dL below lower limit of normal, or < 10 g/dL, attributed to high marrow myeloma infiltration\n  * Bone lesions: >= 1 osteolytic lesion on skeletal x-ray, computed tomography (CT), or positron emission tomography (PET)-CT (bone imaging is not mandatory but based on clinical suspicion)\n  * Clonal bone marrow plasma cells >= 60%\n  * > 1 focal lesion on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (MRI is not mandatory but based on clinical suspicion)\n  * If bone imaging (CT, MRI, PET-CT) was not done at time of diagnosis it is not needed to be performed at registration to rule out bone disease\n\n    * >= 40% BMPCs irrespective of the above\n  * The study will allow patients with involved: uninvolved serum-free light chain (sFLC) ratio >= 100 if this is the only criteria that defines amyloidosis if all the above criteria are not met\n* Seropositive for hepatitis B (defined by a positive test for hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]). Note: Subjects with resolved infection (i.e., subjects who are HBsAg negative but positive for antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen [anti-HBc] and/or antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen [anti-HBs]) must be screened using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) measurement of hepatitis B virus (HBV) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) levels. Those who are PCR positive will be excluded. EXCEPTION: Subjects with serologic findings suggestive of HBV vaccination (anti-HBs positivity as the only serologic marker) AND a known history of prior HBV vaccination, do not need to be tested for HBV DNA by PCR\n* Immunocompromised patients and patients known to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive and currently receiving antiretroviral therapy.\n\n  * NOTE: Patients known to be HIV positive, but without clinical evidence of an immunocompromised state, are eligible for this trial\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to:\n\n  * Ongoing or active infection\n  * Unstable angina pectoris\n  * Psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements",
