    "official_title": "A Phase II Study of Bevacizumab in Adults With Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis (RRP)",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* INCLUSION CRITERIA:\n* Age >= 18 years old.\n* Histologically confirmed diagnosis of RRP.\n* Participants must require procedure(s) to remove papillomatous disease per standard of care.\n* A history of 2 or more surgeries within 12 months prior to treatment initiation in order to control laryngeal and/or tracheal RRP (not required for re-treatment).\n* At least one of the following:\n\n  * A Derkay score of 8 or greater\n  * Measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 (participants with pulmonary RRP only)\n  * Tracheal involvement with RRP that has required two or more clinical interventions in the last 12 months (two or more clinical interventions not required for re-treatment)\n  * Tracheostomy.\n* ECOG performance status of 0-1.\n* Participants must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:\n\n  * White blood cells (WBC): >2,000/microL\n  * Absolute neutrophil count (ANC): >=1,500/microL\n  * Hemoglobin: >9.0 g/dL\n  * Platelets: >=100,000/microL\n  * Total bilirubin: <=1.5 mg/dL, except in participants with Gilbert s Syndrome who must have a total bilirubin less than 3.0 mg/dL\n  * Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) /Alanine aminotransferase (ALT): <=2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)\n  * Creatinine: within normal institutional limits\n\nOR\n\nCreatinine Clearance (CrCl): >=60 mL/min/1.73 m^2 for participants with creatinine levels above institutional normal (calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault formula).\n\n* Prothrombin time (PT) /International normalized ratio (INR) and Partial thromboplastin time (PTT): <=1 X institutional ULN. In participants on anticoagulation, coagulation tests should be within a therapeutic range.\n* Urinalysis: Urine dipstick < 2+ proteinuria. In participants with >=2+ proteinuria on dipstick urinalysis should undergo a 24-hour urine collection and must demonstrate <=1g of protein in 24 hours to be eligible\n\n  * Participants must have received their last systemic therapy for RRP > 4 weeks or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer, prior to treatment initiation, except for systemic bevacizumab which must be > 1 year prior to treatment initiation (not applicable for re-treatment)\n  * Individuals able to become pregnant and their partners must agree to use highly effective method of contraception (hormonal, intrauterine device (IUD), surgical sterilization ) for the duration of bevacizumab treatment and up to 6 months after completion of bevacizumab treatment. Note: abstinence, defined as no heterosexual sexual intercourse when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant is also acceptable.\n  * Breastfeeding participants must be willing to discontinue breastfeeding from study treatment initiation through 6 months after bevacizumab treatment discontinuation.\n  * All participants must have the ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent.\n  * All participants must be willing to undergo mandatory biopsy during the study.\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\n-History of significant (i.e., active) cardiovascular disease or thromboembolic event:\n\ncerebral vascular accident/stroke (within 6 months prior to treatment initiation), myocardial infarction (within 6 months prior to treatment initiation), unstable angina, congestive heart failure (>= New York Heart Association Classification Class II), or serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication as assessed by EKG.\n\n* History of abdominal fistula or gastrointestinal perforation within 6 months prior to treatment initiation.\n* Major surgery within 4 weeks prior to treatment initiation.\n* Non-healing wound, active ulcer, or untreated bone fracture.\n* History of hemoptysis (>2.5 mL of bright red blood per episode) within 1 month prior to treatment initiation.\n* Evidence of bleeding diathesis or significant coagulopathy (with or without current therapeutic anticoagulation).\n* Significant vascular disease (e.g., aortic aneurysm requiring surgical repair or recent peripheral arterial thrombosis) within 6 months prior to treatment initiation.\n* Inadequately controlled hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure (BP) >150 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure > 100 mmHg), an average of 3 BP readings on 2 sessions will be used to measure blood pressure if initial reading indicates inadequately controlled hypertension. NOTE: anti-hypertensive therapy to achieve blood pressures below these parameters is allowed.\n* Prior history of hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy.\n* Persisting toxicity related to prior therapy of Grade >1 per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v 5.0. NOTE: alopecia, sensory neuropathy Grade <=2 are acceptable.\n* Known active alcohol or drug abuse.\n* History of allergy to study drug components.\n* Pregnancy (confirmed with Beta-Human chorionic gonadotropin (Beta-HCG) serum or urine pregnancy test in WOCBP performed at screening).\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness or situation that would limit compliance with study requirements.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 120 Years",
