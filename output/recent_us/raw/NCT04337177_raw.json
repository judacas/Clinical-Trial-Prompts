    "exclusion_criteria": "* Pregnant or breast-feeding women will not be entered on this study due to risks of fetal and teratogenic adverse events as seen in animal/human studies, OR because there is yet no available information regarding human fetal or teratogenic toxicities. Pregnancy tests must be obtained in girls who are post-menarchal. Males or females of reproductive potential may not participate unless they have agreed to use 1 highly effective and 1 additional effective (barrier) method of contraception at the same time for the duration of study therapy and for 4 months after the completion of MLN4924 (pevonedistat) administration.
