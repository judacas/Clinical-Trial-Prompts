Failure to recover from toxicity of prior anticancer therapy to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade ≤ 1 (except alopecia) or levels specified in the inclusion/exclusion criteria, whichever is more severe.\n4. Patients with active autoimmune disease, history of autoimmune disease.\n5. History of immunodeficiency, including HIV seropositivity, other acquired congenital immunodeficiency diseases, or a history of organ transplantation or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.\n6.
