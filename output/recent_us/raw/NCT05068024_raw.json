    "official_title": "A Pilot Study of BTX-A51 in Patients With Metastatic and/or Recurrent Liposarcomas Characterized by MDM2 Amplifications",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Study participants must have histologically-confirmed metastatic and/or recurrent liposarcoma (limited to the subtypes of well-differentiated and/or dedifferentiated liposarcoma, which are associated with MDM2 amplifications).\n* ECOG performance status ≤2\n* Adequate organ and marrow function as defined by the following metrics resulted within 7 days of study enrollment:\n\n  * WBC >3000/mm3\n  * Platelets >75,000μl\n  * ANC >1500μl\n  * Hgb >9g/dl\n  * Creatinine <1.5 x ULN or measured CrCl of >60ml/m2/1.73 m2\n  * Total bilirubin <2 x ULN\n  * AST/ALT <3 x ULN\n* Participants must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for non- nodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as ≥20 mm (≥2 cm) by chest x-ray or as\n\n  ≥10 mm (≥1 cm) with CT scan, MRI, or calipers by clinical exam. See Section 11 (Measurement of Effect) for the evaluation of measurable disease.\n* Patients must have recovered from toxicity related to prior therapy to grade <=1 (defined by CTCAE v5.0) (except alopecia and neuropathy, or immunotherapy related hypothyroidism)\n* As the effect of this study drug on the developing human fetus is not known, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use at least 2 methods of contraception (abstinence; hormonal or barrier method of birth control) for the study and at least 2 months after completion.\n* Female patient of childbearing potential has a negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days of study enrollment.\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n* Age ≥18 years\n* Patients must have completed all prior anti-cancer treatment for liposarcoma, including radiation, ≥ 14 days prior to registration.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Patient with current evidence of active and uncontrolled infection, NYHA Class III-IV CHF, documented Child's class B-C cirrhosis, or uncontrolled medical disease which in the opinion of the investigator or the sponsor could compromise safety and/or assessment of efficacy.\n* Active infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV); subjects who are positive for hepatitis B core antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen, or hepatitis C antibody must have a negative PCR result before enrollment; those who are PCR positive will be excluded.\n* Major surgical procedure or open surgical biopsy within 28 days of first dose of study drug\n* Active central nervous system (CNS) disease involvement, or prior history of NCI CTCAE Grade ≥3 drug-related CNS toxicity. Subject with known CNS metastases that are treated and stable (without evidence of CNS toxicity) and are not requiring systemic steroids are allowed to be enrolled.\n* Patient has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial\n* Myocardial infarction within 12 months of screening\n* Use of any other concurrent investigational agents or anticancer agents, excluding hormonal therapy for breast or prostate cancer\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with BTX- A51, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with BTX-A51.\n* Inability to swallow pills or inadequate GI absorption in the opinion of the treating investigator.",
