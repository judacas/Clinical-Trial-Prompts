    "inclusion_criteria": "* INCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\n  1. Patients must have histologically documented metastatic solid tumors which have progressed after one line of therapy, or lymphoma which has progressed after initial therapy and without potentially curative options, or patient refuses potentially curative therapy.\n  2. Patients must have measurable or evaluable disease\n  3. Age greater than or equal to 18 years.\n  4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status less than or equal to 2\n  5. Life expectancy of greater than 3 months.\n  6. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:\n\n     leukocytes greater than or equal to 3,000/mcL\n\n     absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1,500/mcL\n\n     platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/mcL\n\n     total bilirubin within normal institutional limits\n\n     Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT)/ alanine aminotransferase (ALT) serum glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) less than or equal to 2.5 institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)\n\n     Serum creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 institutional ULN\n\n     OR\n\n     creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2 for patients with serum creatinine levels greater than 1.5 x higher than institutional normal.\n  7. Anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or any direct oral anticoagulant (direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC), e.g., rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran, or edoxaban) will be permitted. Patients receiving treatment with warfarin will be given the option to switch to LMWH or a DOAC.\n  8. Patients must have recovered to grade 1 or baseline from adverse events (AEs) and/or toxicity of prior chemotherapy or biologic therapy. They must not have had chemotherapy, biologic therapy, or definitive radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas and mitomycin C) or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter, prior to entering the study. Palliative-intent radiotherapy (30 Gray (Gy) or less) must be completed at least 2 weeks prior to start of treatment and may not be to a lesion that is included as measurable disease. Patients must be greater than or equal to 2 weeks since any investigational agent administered as part of a Phase 0 study (where a sub-therapeutic dose of drug is administered) at the PI's discretion and should have recovered to grade 1 or baseline from any toxicities.\n  9. Patients receiving denosumab or bisphosphonates for any cancer or undergoing androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer are eligible for this therapy.\n  10. Prior therapy with topoisomerase I inhibitors is allowed.\n  11. Patients with known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive status are eligible provided the following criteria are met: cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) count >350/mm^3, an undetectable viral load, and not receiving prophylaxis antibiotics. Diagnostic HIV testing will not be performed during screening or throughout this study.\n  12. The effects of LMP744 (NSC 706744) on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Women and men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 4 months after completion of LMP744 administration.\n  13. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n  14. Willingness to provide blood and new tumor biopsy samples for research purposes if on the expansion phase of the study.\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\n1. Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.\n2. Patients with clinically significant illnesses which would compromise participation in the study, including, but not limited to active or uncontrolled infection, immune deficiencies, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, uncontrolled diabetes, uncontrolled hypertension, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, myocardial infarction within the past 6 months, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n3. Patients with known brain metastases or carcinomatous meningitis are excluded from this clinical trial, with the exception of patients whose brain metastatic disease status has remained stable for greater than or equal to 1 month after treatment of the brain metastases. Patients on anti-seizure medications or steroid therapy may be enrolled at the discretion of the Principal Investigator.\n4. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because LMP744 is an agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with LMP744, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated.\n\nINCLUSION OF WOMEN AND MINORITIES:\n\nBoth men and women of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this trial.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
