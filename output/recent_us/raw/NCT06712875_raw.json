No ongoing requirement for corticosteroids as therapy for CNS disease; anticonvulsants at a stable dose allowed\n    5. No stereotactic or whole brain radiation within 14 days prior to C1D1.\n19. Individuals with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen are eligible for this trial.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Prior treatment with an oncolytic therapy.\n2. Currently receiving antiviral drug therapy (e.g. valacyclovir or acyclovir).\n3. Has acute or chronic active hepatitis B and C virus infection or known history of hepatitis B (defined as hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] reactive) or known active hepatitis C virus (HCV) (defined as HCV RNA [qualitative]) or HIV infection.Note: No testing for Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, or HIV is required unless mandated by local health authority or if clinically indicated.\n4. Had systemic infection requiring IV antibiotics or other serious infection within 14 days prior to dosing.\n5. Has active significant herpetic infections or prior complications of herpes simplex 1 (HSV-1) infection (e.g., herpetic keratitis or encephalitis).\n6. Systemic anticancer therapy within 4 weeks prior to enrollment or five half-lives, whichever is shorter, before the first administration of VO. Note: programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) directed therapy is allowed (see Inclusion Criteria 6.)\n7. Has not recovered from adverse events due to prior anti-cancer therapy to <= grade 1 or baseline. Note: participants with toxicities after prior anticancer therapies that are not considered a likely safety risk such as Grade ≤ 2 neuropathy or alopecia, or immune mediated AEs that are unlikely to recur with standard countermeasures (e.g., hormone replacement after adrenal crisis, stable endocrine insufficiencies such as thyroid and adrenal insufficiency), are an exception to this criterion and may qualify for the study in discussion with the Principal Investigator.\n8. Is currently participating in or has participated in a study of an investigational agent or has used an investigational device within four weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment. Note: participants who have entered the follow-up phase of an investigational study may participate as long as it has been four weeks since the last dose of the previous investigational agent.\n9. Has received prior radiotherapy within two weeks of start of study treatment. Note: participants who are eligible must have recovered from all radiation-related toxicities, not require corticosteroids, and not have had radiation pneumonitis. A 1-week washout is permitted for palliative radiation (<=2 weeks of radiotherapy) to non-CNS disease.\n10. History of interstitial lung disease.\n11. History of documented allergic reactions or acute hypersensitivity attributed to VO and pembrolizumab or any of its excipients.\n12.

Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to: measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster (chicken pox), yellow fever, rabies, Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Note: Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed, however, intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., FluMist®) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed. Available Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines do not contain live virus and are allowed.\n13.

For the definition of replacement therapy.\n14. Undergo major surgery ≤ 2 weeks prior to starting VO. Note: participants who undergo major surgery requiring general anesthesia such as exploratory laparotomy or thoracotomy and are eligible for the study must adequately recover prior to starting study treatment. Procedures such as central line placement, endoscopies and tooth extractions under local anesthesia do not meet criteria for major surgery.\n15. Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required corticosteroids or has current pneumonitis.\n16. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that will be unfavorable for the administration of study drug or affect the explanation of drug toxicity or AEs, or interfere with the participant's participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of the participant to participate, in the opinion of the treating Investigator.\n17. Has known psychiatric, alcohol abuse, or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperating with the requirements of the study.\n18. Has serious uncontrolled medical disorders such as uncontrolled hypertension, bleeding diatheses, uncontrolled diabetes.\n19. Has clinically significant cardiovascular disease within 12 months from first dose of study drug, including New York Heart Association Class III or IV congestive heart failure, unstable angina, myocardial infarction, cerebral vascular accident, history of myocarditis, or cardiac arrhythmia associated with hemodynamic instability.\n20.
