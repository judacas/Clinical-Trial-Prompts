    "inclusion_criteria": "* Patients must be ≥1 year and < 22 years of age at the time of enrollment.\n* Patient must have one of the following diagnoses:\n\n  * Treatment-related MDS/AML: Patients with solid organ or hematopoietic neoplasms previously treated with alkylating agents, ionizing radiation, topoisomerase inhibitors, antimetabolites, thiopurines, mycophenolate mofetil, fludarabine, and anti-tubulin agents (vincristine, vinblastine, vindesine, paclitaxel, and docetaxel usually in combination), who develop MDS, or AML are candidates for the CPXSMN protocol. If the bone marrow has between 5% and 20% blasts (higher-risk MDS), patients are discussed with the hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) team for consideration to receive chemotherapy before HSCT. If the consensus is that cytoreduction before HSCT is necessary, and the cumulative dose of doxorubicin equivalent is < 500 mg/m2 (in cases of cardio protection) or ≤400 mg/m^2 (cases without cardio protection), patients are eligible for the CPXSMN protocol OR\n  * Secondary MDS/AML: Patients with primary MDS in transformation to AML (refractory cytopenia with an excess of blasts), acquired aplastic anemia evolving to AML, myeloid neoplasms arising from inherited bone marrow failure syndromes (including severe congenital neutropenia, Schwachman-Diamond syndrome, MECOM syndrome) or MDS/AML predisposition syndromes (including germline predisposition in GATA2, RUNX1, SAMD9/SAMD9L, ERCC6L2, NF1, ETV6, ANKRD26, ERCC6L2, TP53 or CEBPA genes) are eligible for the CPXSMN trial. If the bone marrow has between 5% and 20% blasts (higher-risk MDS), patients are discussed with the HSCT team for consideration to receive chemotherapy before HSCT.

At institutions that do not obtain a direct bilirubin in patients with a normal total bilirubin, a normal total bilirubin may be used as evidence that the direct bilirubin is not > 1.5 x the ULN.\n  * SGPT (ALT) ≤ 3.0 x ULN for age and institution (unless it is related to leukemic involvement).\n* Adequate cardiac function defined as:\n\n  * Shortening fraction of ≥27% by echocardiogram, or\n  * Ejection fraction of ≥ 50% by radionuclide angiogram or echocardiogram, and\n  * Corrected QT (QTcB) interval < 500 msecs\n* Central nervous system function defined as:\n\n  * Patients with seizure disorder may be enrolled if on anticonvulsants and if seizures are well controlled\n  * CNS toxicity ≤ Grade 2\n* Prior therapy\n\n  * Patients must have recovered from the acute toxic effects of all prior chemotherapy, immunotherapy, HSCT or radiotherapy prior to entering this study. All prior treatment-related toxicities must have resolved to ≤ Grade 2 prior to enrollment.\n\n    1. Myelosuppressive chemotherapy: Must not have received myelosuppressive chemotherapy within 3 weeks of entry onto this study (excluding hydroxyurea). Cyto-reduction with hydroxyurea can be initiated and continued for up to 24 hours prior to the start of CPX-351.\n    2. Biologic (anti-neoplastic agent): At least 7 days since the completion of therapy with steroids, retinoids or hypomethylating agents. Note: For agents that have known adverse events occurring beyond 7 days after administration (i.e. monoclonal antibodies), this period must be extended beyond the time during which acute adverse events are known to occur.\n    3. Radiation therapy (RT): ≥ 2 weeks for local palliative RT (small port); ≥ 6 months must have elapsed if prior craniospinal RT or if ≥ 50% radiation of pelvis; ≥ 6 weeks must have elapsed if other substantial BM radiation.

Patients with prior cumulative doxorubicin equivalent > 400 mg/m2 and prior radiation (any dose) to the mediastinum are not eligible for the protocol.\n    4. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: No evidence of active graft vs. host disease for at least 4 weeks.
