    "official_title": "An Observer-blind Study to Evaluate the Efficacy, Safety, Reactogenicity and Immunogenicity of the GSK Biologicals' Investigational Vaccine GSK3277511A When Administered to COPD Patients",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol.\n* Written informed consent obtained from the subject prior to performing any study specific procedure.\n* A male or female between, and including, 40 and 80 years of age at the time of the first vaccination.\n* Confirmed diagnosis of COPD with forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) over forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio (FEV1/FVC) < 0.7, AND FEV1 < 80% predicted (GOLD 2, 3 and 4).\n* Current or former smoker with a cigarette smoking history of ≥ 10 pack-years.\n* Stable COPD patient* with documented history** of at least 1 moderate or severe AECOPD within the 12 months before Screening.\n\n  * Patient for whom the last episode of AECOPD is resolved for at least 30 days at the time of first vaccination.\n\n    * A documented history of a COPD exacerbation is a medical record of worsening COPD symptoms that required systemic/oral corticosteroids and/or antibiotics (for a moderate exacerbation) or hospitalization (for a severe exacerbation). Prior use of antibiotics alone does not qualify as an exacerbation history unless the use was associated with treatment of worsening symptoms of COPD, such as increased dyspnea, sputum volume, or sputum purulence. Subject verbal reports are not acceptable.\n* Capable of complying with the daily electronic Diary Card completion throughout the study period, according to investigator's judgement at Visit 1.\n* Female subjects of non-childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study. Non-childbearing potential is defined as pre-menarche, current bilateral tubal ligation or occlusion, hysterectomy, bilateral ovariectomy or post-menopause.\n* Female subjects of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study, if the subject:\n\nhas practiced adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination, and has a negative pregnancy test on the day of vaccination, and has agreed to continue adequate contraception during the entire treatment period and for 2 months after completion of the vaccination series.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 40 Years\nMust have maximum age of 80 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Use of any investigational or non-registered product other than the study vaccine during the period starting 30 days before the first dose of study vaccine (Day -29 to Day 1), or planned use during the study period.\n* Any medical condition that in the judgment of the investigator would make intramuscular injection unsafe.\n* Administration of immunoglobulins or any blood products within the 3 months preceding the first dose of study vaccine or planned administration during the study period.\n* Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on medical history and physical examination.\n* Planned administration/ administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol in the period starting 30 days before the first dose and ending 30 days after the last dose of vaccine, with the exception of any influenza or pneumococcal vaccine which may be administered ≥15 days preceding or following any study vaccine dose.\n* Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a non-investigational vaccine/product.\n* Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immune-modifying drugs during the period starting six months prior to the first vaccine dose (e.g. methotrexate).\n* Administration of systemic corticosteroids within the 30 days before first vaccination.\n\nSubjects who received systemic corticosteroids within this period may be enrolled at a later date if enrolment is still open.\n\nInhaled and topical steroids are allowed.\n\n• Administration of systemic antibiotics within the 30 days before first vaccination.\n\nSubjects who received systemic antibiotics within this period may be enrolled at a later date if enrolment is still open.\n\n* Chronic use of antibiotics for prevention of AECOPD (e.g. azithromycin).\n* Acute disease and/or fever at the time of first vaccination. Fever is defined as temperature ≥37.5°C. The preferred location for measuring temperature in this study will be the oral cavity or the axilla.\n\nSubjects with a minor illness (such as mild diarrhoea, mild upper respiratory infection) without fever may be enrolled at the discretion of the investigator.\n\n* Oxygen therapy: Use of long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) described as resting oxygen therapy >3L/min (Oxygen use ≤3L/min flow is not exclusionary).\n* Planned lung transplantation.\n* Lung resection: Subjects with planned lung volume reduction surgery during the study or within the 12 months prior to first vaccination.\n* Diagnosis of α-1 antitrypsin deficiency as the underlying cause of COPD.\n* Diagnosed with a respiratory disorder other than COPD at time of enrolment (such as sarcoidosis, active tuberculosis, clinically significant bronchiectasis, clinically significant lung fibrosis, clinically significant pulmonary embolism, clinically significant pneumothorax, current diagnosis of asthma in the opinion of the investigator), or chest X-ray/ CT scan revealing evidence of clinically significant abnormalities not believed to be due to the presence of COPD. Subjects with allergic rhinitis do not need to be excluded and may be enrolled at the discretion of the investigator.\n* History of immune-mediated disease other than COPD. If the subject has any condition on the non-exhaustive list of potential immune-mediated diseases defined in the protocol, they must be excluded unless the aetiology is clearly documented to be non-immune mediated.\n* Previous vaccination with any vaccine containing NTHi and/ or Mcat antigens.\n* History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccines and/ or the bronchodilator used for spirometry assessment during the study.\n* Contraindication for spirometry testing.\n* Unstable or life threatening cardiac disease: subjects with any of the following at Screening (Visit 1) would be excluded:\n\nMyocardial infarction or unstable angina in the last 6 months. Unstable or life threatening cardiac arrhythmia requiring intervention in the last 3 months NYHA Class IV Heart failure\n\n* Malignancies within the previous 5 years or lymphoproliferative disorder.\n* Any known disease or condition likely to cause death during the study period.\n* Pregnant or lactating female.\n* Current alcoholism and/or drug abuse.\n* Other condition which the investigator judges may put the safety of the subject at risk through study participation or which may interfere with the study findings.\n* Planned move to a location that will complicate participation in the trial through study end.",
