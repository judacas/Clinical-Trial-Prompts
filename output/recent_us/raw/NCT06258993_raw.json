    "inclusion_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria for Dose escalation zeaxanthin monotherapy\n\n1. Stage IV or unresectable stage 3 histologically confirmed solid tumor malignancy refractory to all standard therapies known to provide clinical benefit (unless the therapy is contraindicated or intolerable) in the opinion of the treating investigator for his/her tumor type. Subjects are not required to have received systemic therapies that have response rates under 20% with no associated survival benefit (for example DTIC chemotherapy and high dose Interleukin-2 in melanoma patients).\n2. Age ≥ 18 years.\n3. Performance status ECOG 0, 1 or 2\n4. Adequate organ and marrow function as describe below:\n\n   * Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcL\n   * Platelets ≥ 100,000/mcl\n   * Total bilirubin < 1.5 x the normal institutional limits excluding patients with confirmed Gilbert's syndrome\n   * AST (SGOT)/ALT (SPGT) ≤ 3 x the institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)\n   * Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x the institutional upper limit of normal\n5. Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for 90 days following completion of therapy. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.\n\n   Recommended methods of birth control are:\n   1. The consistent use of an approved hormonal contraception (birth control pill/patches, rings), An intrauterine device (IUD), Contraceptive injection (Depo-Provera), Double barrier methods (Diaphragm with spermicidal gel or condoms with contraceptive foam), Sexual abstinence (no sexual intercourse) or Sterilization.\n   2. Men must agree to use a condom and not father a child or donate sperm for the duration of the study and for 90 days after completion of therapy\n\n   A Female of child-bearing potential is any woman (regardless of sexual orientation, having undergone a tubal ligation, or remaining celibate by choice) who meets at least one of the following criteria:\n   1. Has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy\n   2. Has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months).\n6. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent.\n7. Measurable disease is not required but evaluable disease is required.\n8. Life expectancy of at least 3 months\n\nExclusion Criteria for Dose escalation zeoxanthin monotherapy\n\n1. Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 21 days prior to initiating study treatment or those who have not recovered to grade 1 or less from adverse events due to agents administered more than 21 days earlier excluding alopecia, gd 2 fatigue, gd 2 hearing loss from platinum agent, and endocrinopathies on stable replacement therapy.\n\n   (Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents or concomitant chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Hormonal therapy is not exclusionary.)\n2. Patients with active brain metastases requiring palliation with steroids and not stable for at least 4 weeks post radiation therapy or surgery.\n3. Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis\n4. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to zeaxanthin.\n5. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, unstable cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n6. Patients with another primary malignancy not in remission for at least 3 years. Exceptions include nonmelanoma skin cancer, curatively treated localized prostate cancer with normal prostate specific antigen, low risk prostate cancer followed expectantly, stage I colorectal cancer resected, resected stage 1 breast cancer cervical carcinoma in situ on biopsy, melanoma in situ resected, or squamous intraepithelial lesion on PAP smear.\n7. Patients must not be pregnant or nursing due to the potential for congenital abnormalities and the potential of this regimen to harm nursing infants. Women of child bearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test prior to the first dose of study treatment\n8. Inability to swallow pills.\n\nInclusion Criteria for dose escalation zeoxanthin plus pembrolizumab\n\n1. Stage IV or unresectable stage 3 histologically confirmed solid tumor malignancy for which pembrolizumab is FDA approved and progressed on prior PD-1 or PD-L1 therapy and if indicated for cancer type refractory to all standard therapies known to provide clinical benefit (unless the therapy is contraindicated or intolerable) in the opinion of the treating investigator for his/her tumor type. Subjects are not required to have received systemic therapies that have response rates under 20% with no associated survival benefit (for example DTIC chemotherapy and high dose Interleukin-2 in melanoma patients).\n2. Patients must have had symptomatic or radiographic progression during or following treatment with a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor. This is defined as imaging obtained subsequent to initiation of PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor demonstrating a new lesion that is consistent with metastasis or growth of a preexisting metastasis which the treating physician felt reflected tumor progression and therefore discontinued the immunotherapy. . Symptomatic progression refers to development of worsening bone pain related to bone metastasis that cannot be accurately measured on imaging and for which the treating physician had discontinued the immunotherapy.\n3. Age ≥ 18 years.\n4. Performance status ECOG 0, 1or 2.\n5. Adequate organ and marrow function as describe below:\n\n   * Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcL\n   * Platelets ≥ 100,000/mcl\n   * Total bilirubin) ≤ 1.5 x normal institutional limits excluding patients with confirmed Gilbert's syndrome\n   * AST (SGOT)/ALT (SPGT) ≤ 3 x institutional upper limit of normal\n   * Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x the institutional upper limit of normal\n6.
