Clinically significant active infection or interstitial lung diseases (including drug induced pneumonitis);\n11. Major surgical procedure within 4 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment;\n12. Adverse events from prior anti-neoplastic therapy that have not resolved to Grade less than or equal to 1, except for alopecia;\n13.

History of inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis);\n20. Patients with ongoing chronic gastrointestinal diseases;\n21. Any other diseases, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding that, in the investigator's opinion, gives reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that contraindicates the use of an investigational drug or that may affect the interpretation of the results or renders the patient at high risk from treatment complications.",
