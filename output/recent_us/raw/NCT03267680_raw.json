    "inclusion_criteria": "-Histologically or cytologically confirmed high-grade neuroendocrine tumor that has progressed after at least one line of therapy, excluding small cell lung cancer (SCLC). High grade includes any neuroendocrine neoplasm with a Ki-67 of >=20% or with mitotic count of more than 20 mitoses per high power field or any poorly differentiated neoplasm or any neoplasm lacking these that is deemed high grade by pathology consensus, based on other markers (necrosis or IHC demonstrating p53 or RB mutation). This includes:\n\n* High grade well differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasms\n* Transformed NENs from a lower to a higher grade (patient may have some low grade and some high grade NENs)\n* High grade neoplasms with significant expression of neuroendocrine markers such as synaptophysin, chromogranin or INSM-1 or unknown origin neoplasms with gene expression signatures consistent with neuroendocrine lineage (as per validated tissue of origin testing, such as CancerType ID, after pathology consensus).\n* Mixed neuroendocrine and non-neuroendocrine neoplasms (MiNEN), including MiNEN per WHO and mixed neoplasms not fulfilling criteria of MiNEN. The neuroendocrine component would need to be a high-grade neuroendocrine tumor as documented by pathology review.\n\nNote: Up to two prostate NEC patients (primary diagnosis, not transformed adenocarcinoma) will be enrolled in the first phase.

Female subjects are considered to be of childbearing potential unless one of the following criteria are met: documented permanent sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy) or documented postmenopausal status (defined as 12 months of amenorrhea in a woman > 45 years-of-age in the absence of other biological or physiological causes. In addition, females < 55 years-of-age must have a serum follicle stimulating (FSH) level > 40 mIU/mL to confirm menopause).\n* Ability to understand and willingness to sign an IRB approved written informed consent document (or that of legally authorized representative, if applicable).\n* Willing to undergo 3 mandatory biopsies: in screening, on treatment prior to C2, and at EOT, if safe and feasible.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* A history of other malignancy with the exception of malignancies for which all treatment was completed at least 2 years before registration and the patient has no evidence of disease.
