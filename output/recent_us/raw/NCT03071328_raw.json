    "inclusion_criteria": "* Able to provide signed and dated informed consent form\n* Willing to comply with all study procedures and be available for the duration of the study\n* Male or female, aged greater than 18 years of age\n* Has a diagnosis of Multiple Myeloma\n* Is on the monthly phase of daratumumab (either intravenous [IV] or subcutaneous [SubQ]) based regimen (every 4 weeks) (either monotherapy or in combination with oral agents)\n* Is willing to receive daratumumab subcutaneous injections\n* Lives within the range of Jefferson Home Infusion Services\n* Patients are willing to allow home infusion company visit them and administer Darzalex-Faspro in the home\n* Women of reproductive potential must use highly effective contraception\n* Men of reproductive potential must use highly effective contraception\n* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) > 1,000\n* Platelet count > 50,000\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) / alanine transaminase (ALT) < 2.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN)\n* Bilirubin < 2 times ULN\n* Creatinine clearance (CrCl) >= 20 mL/min for single agent subcutaneous (SC) daratumumab. For combination studies: with lenalidomide >= 30 mL/min\n* English speaking\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Receiving daratumumab for an indication other than multiple myeloma\n* Receiving daratumumab in combination with other IV or subcutaneous therapy\n* Pregnancy or lactation\n* Known allergic reactions to components of the study product(s)\n* Uncontrolled human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\n* Seropositive for hepatitis B (defined by a positive test for hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]) who are not on hepatitis B prophylaxis. Subjects with resolved infection (ie, subjects who are HBsAg negative but positive for antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen [anti-HBc] and/or antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen [anti-HBs]) must be screened using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) measurement of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA levels. Those who are PCR positive and not on Hep B prophylaxis will be excluded. EXCEPTION: Subjects with serologic findings suggestive of HBV vaccination (anti-HBs positivity as the only serologic marker) AND a known history of prior HBV vaccination, do not need to be tested for HBV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) by PCR\n* Patients with reactivation of hepatitis B will be excluded\n* Seropositive for hepatitis C (except in the setting of a sustained virologic response [SVR], defined as a viremia at least 12 weeks after completion of antiviral therapy)\n* Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) < 50% of predicted normal. Note that FEV1 testing is required for participants suspected of having COPD and participants must be excluded if FEV1 is < 50% of predicted normal\n* Moderate or severe persistent asthma within the past 2 years, or uncontrolled asthma of any classification. Note that participants who currently have controlled intermittent asthma or controlled mild persistent asthma are allowed to participate\n* Clinically significant cardiac disease, including:\n\n  * Myocardial infarction within 6 months before randomization, or unstable or uncontrolled disease/condition related to or affection cardiac function (e.g., unstable angina, congestive heart failure, New York Heart Association Class III-IV)\n  * Uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia\n  * Screening 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) showing a baseline QT interval as corrected by Fridericia's formula > 470 msec\n* Non-English Speaking",
