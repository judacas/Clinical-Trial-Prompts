Participants with inadequate tissue sample availability may still be considered for enrollment upon review\n* Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 for Cohorts A1, A2, B3, and B5\n\n  * Less than or equal to 2 for Cohorts B1, B2, B4, and C1\n* Prior Systemic Therapy Criteria:\n\n  * Cohort A1/C1: Participant has received all standard therapies for which the participant was deemed to be an appropriate candidate by the treating Investigator; OR the participant is refusing the remaining most appropriate standard of care treatment; OR there is no standard therapy available for the disease. There is no restriction on number of prior therapies.\n  * Cohort A2, B2, B3 participants must have received at least one prior regimen, and cohorts B1 and B4 participants at least 2 prior regimens, in the locally advanced or metastatic setting\n  * There is no restriction on number of prior therapies\n* Cohort B5: Participants have not received prior systemic therapy for locally advanced or metastatic UC\n* FGFR inhibitor specific requirements:\n\n  * Cohort A1/A2/B3: Prior FGFR inhibitor treatment is permitted but not required\n  * Cohort B1/B4: Participants must have been previously treated with erdafitinib\n  * Cohort B2, B5, and C1: Participants must be FGFR inhibitor na√Øve\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Participants with primary central nervous system (CNS) malignancy\n* Untreated or uncontrolled CNS metastases\n* Current evidence of corneal keratopathy or retinal disorder. Individuals with asymptomatic ophthalmic conditions may be eligible\n* Any serious unresolved toxicities from prior therapy\n* Significant cardiovascular disease\n* Prolongation of the QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia's formula (QTcF)\n* Active uncontrolled systemic infection or other clinically significant medical conditions\n* Participants who are pregnant, lactating, or plan to breastfeed during the study or within 6 months of the last dose of study treatment. Participants who have stopped breastfeeding may be enrolled",
