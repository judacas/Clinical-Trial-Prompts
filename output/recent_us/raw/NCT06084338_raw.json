Adequate renal and liver function as indicated by:\n\n   A. Serum creatinine acceptable for treatment with cisplatin per institutional guidelines) B. Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper-normal limit (ULN) C. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 x ULN D. Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 x ULN\n6. Human papilloma virus (HPV) status in tumor has been documented using tumor immunohistochemistry for HPV-p16 or other accepted test for patients with cancers of the oropharynx, base of tongue, or unknown primary.\n7. Age 18 years or older\n8. Patient must consent to the access, review and analysis of previous medical and cancer history, including imaging data by the sponsor or a third party nominated by the sponsor.\n9.

Adequate visual access to permit examination of the following oral cavity sites: lips, buccal mucosa, floor of mouth, ventral and lateral tongue and soft palate.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Prior radiation to the head and neck\n2. Tumor of the lips, nasopharynx, hypopharynx, larynx, or salivary glands\n3.

Any significant medical diseases or conditions, as assessed by the investigators and sponsor that would substantially increase the medical risks of participating in this study (i.e., uncontrolled diabetes, NYHA II-IV congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction within 6 months of study, severe chronic pulmonary disease or active uncontrolled infection, uncontrolled or clinically relevant pulmonary edema).\n11. Pregnant or nursing\n12. Untreated active oral or dental infection, including severe tooth decay (caries)\n13.
