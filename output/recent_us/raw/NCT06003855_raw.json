    "inclusion_criteria": "1. The first 2 subjects must be 18 years or older at the time of signing the informed consent. If approved by the SRC, additional subjects (after the first 2 subjects) may be 6 years or older at the time of signing the informed consent; otherwise additional subjects must be 18 years or older until such time it is considered by the SRC as appropriate to lower the age limit to 6 years.\n2. Subjects who have a confirmed diagnosis of DEB as determined by electron microscopy, immunomapping, or genetic testing. Subjects with severe DEB (e.g., RDEB patients with absent Col VII/no anchoring fibrils) and milder forms of DEB (e.g., RDEB patients with reduced Col VII and/or anchoring fibril levels) will be eligible.\n3. Subjects who have one or more active wounds (unroofed EB erosions) each between 10 and 50 cm2 on arms, legs, or trunk.\n4. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test at screening and agree to continue use of an acceptable form of birth control throughout the duration of the study. Acceptable forms of birth control include oral, implant, injectable, and transdermal contraceptives; an intrauterine device; or other forms considered acceptable by the investigator.\n5. Subjects or guardian of subjects who are under the age of 18 years must be capable of giving signed informed consent as described in Appendix 1, which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the informed consent form (ICF) and in this protocol.\n6. Subjects must be willing to comply with the protocol requirements.\n7. Subjects must be accessible for wound treatments and assessment visits.\n8. Subjects must have a negative urine test for drugs of abuse at the screening visit.\n9. Female subjects willing to minimize the risk of inducing pregnancy for the duration of the clinical study and follow-up period.\n10. A female subject is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant (i.e. has a negative urine pregnancy result at the Screening Visit and on Day 1), and at least one of the following conditions applies:\n11. Not a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) as defined in Appendix 3\n12. Or a WOCBP who agrees to follow the contraceptive guidance in Appendix 3 during the intervention and follow-up period\n\nNote: Reference to Appendix 3 can be located in the protocol\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 6 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. The subject has clinical evidence of systemic infection.\n2. The subject has a history or bone marrow transplantation.\n3. The subject has evidence of autoimmune disease, including insulin-dependent diabetes.\n4. The subject has wounds that are considered by the investigator as likely to heal within 1 month after standard therapy.\n5. The subject has clinical evidence of an active infection at the wound site.\n6. The subject has evidence of significant wound healing before treatment (i.e., â‰¥ 20% closure of wound during the first month observation period treatment).\n7. The subject has a wound that extends across the fingers, toes, pubic or perineum region.\n8. The subject has a severe medical condition, such as malignancy (including skin cancer), a life expectancy of < 2 years, or severe cardiopulmonary disease that restricts ambulation to the clinical facility.\n9. The subject has a history of coagulopathy.\n10. The subject currently uses systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents.\n11. The subject is allergic to human albumin, streptomycin, or penicillin.\n12. The subject is a potential recipient of tissue or organ transplantation.\n13. The subject has a current history of alcohol or substance abuse or has a history of alcohol or substance abuse that required treatment within the previous 12 months.\n14. The subject has a positive test result for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) at screening.\n15. The subject has a history of poor compliance or unreliability.\n16. Females who are pregnant, nursing, or planning a pregnancy during their participation in the study.",
