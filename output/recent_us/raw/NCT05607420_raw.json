For those with a total bilirubin > 1.5 x ULN, a direct bilirubin should be performed and must be < 1.5 mg/dL for Gilbert's to be diagnosed (obtained =< 14 days prior to registration)\n* Serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) (aspartate aminotransferase [AST])/serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) (alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) =< 3.0 x the institutional ULN (obtained =< 14 days prior to registration)\n\n  * NOTE: If value is higher due to hepatic involvement by CLL, patient is eligible\n* Prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR) < 1.5 ULN and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) (activated partial thromboplastin time [aPTT]) < 1.5 x ULN (obtained =< 14 days prior to registration)\n* No active hemolytic anemia requiring immunosuppressive therapy or other pharmacologic treatment. Patients who have a positive Coombs test but no evidence of hemolysis are NOT excluded from participation\n* No current use of corticosteroids. EXCEPTION: Low doses of steroids (< 10 mg of prednisone or equivalent dose of other steroid; inhaled steroids) used for treatment of non-hematologic medical condition (e.g. chronic adrenal insufficiency) is permitted\n* No previous autoimmune complications (e.g. autoimmune hemolytic anemia or immune thrombocytopenia) that have developed since the initial diagnosis of CLL and have required treatment with high dose corticosteroids (e.g. equivalent of > 20 mg/day of prednisone), monoclonal antibody based therapy, or chemotherapy. Prior use of corticosteroids for reasons other than treatment of autoimmune complications is allowed\n* No other active primary malignancy (other than non-melanomatous skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix) requiring treatment or limiting expected survival to =< 2 years\n\n  * NOTE: If there is a history of prior malignancy, the patient must not currently be receiving other specific treatment (other than hormonal therapy for their cancer)\n* Able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements\n* No major surgery within 4 weeks (28 days) of first dose of study drug or minor surgery within 3 days of first dose of study drug\n* No radiation therapy =< 4 weeks prior to registration to Step 1\n* Patients who are human immunodeficiency virus positive (HIV+) with undetectable HIV viral load are eligible provided they meet all other protocol criteria for participation and are not being treated with protease inhibitors or any non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) that are CYP3A4 inducers; if being treated for HIV, patients should be receiving an alternative antiretroviral therapy (ART) that is not a CYP3A inhibitor\n* Patients must not have any of the following conditions:\n\n  * Congestive heart failure or New York Heart Association Functional Classification III or IV congestive heart failure\n  * History of myocardial infarction, unstable angina, or acute coronary syndrome within 6 months prior to registration\n  * Recent infections requiring systemic treatment;

in addition, if negative for HBsAg but hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) positive (regardless of hepatitis B surface antibody [HBsAb] status), a hepatitis B deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) test will be performed and, if positive the subject will be ineligible; if the hepatitis (Hep) B DNA test is negative (i.e. viral load undetectable) then the individual is eligible; if a patient who is HBsAg negative, HBsAb negative, HBcAb positive, and Hep B DNA negative is enrolled, they should be considered for either prophylactic anti-viral therapy (J Clin Oncol. 2013 Aug 1;31(22):2765-72) or careful monitoring for Hep B reactivation (J Clin Oncol. 2014 Nov 20;32(33):3736-43)\n* Patients are not eligible if they require treatment with a strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A inhibitor\n* Patients may not have received the following within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug:\n\n  * Steroid therapy for anti-neoplastic intent\n  * Strong and moderate CYP3A inhibitors\n  * Strong and moderate CYP3A inducers\n* Patients may not be on any other investigational agents\n* Patients may not have received warfarin or another vitamin K antagonist in the preceding 30 days\n* Women must not be pregnant or breast-feeding since this study involves investigational agents whose genotoxic, mutagenic, and teratogenic effects on the developing fetus and newborn are unknown;
