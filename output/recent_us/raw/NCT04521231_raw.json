Serum alanine transaminase (SGPT/ALT) < 5 x upper limit of normal (ULN)\n  2. Serum aspartate transaminase (SGOT/AST) < 5 x ULN\n  3. Serum Bilirubin (total) < 2.5 x ULN\n  4. Serum Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN\n* Electrocardiogram (ECG) with no clinically significant findings as assessed by the Investigator.\n* Weight ≥ 50kg\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Pregnant and nursing women\n* Diagnosis of low-grade anal dysplasia (AIN 1, LSIL), without the concomitant diagnosis of anal HSIL, by HRA\n* Concurrent anal, vulvar, cervical, or penile cancer\n* HIV seropositivity\n* Currently receiving systemic chemotherapy or radiation therapy for another cancer.\n* Patients who are on medical treatment with systemic immunosuppressants or steroids (e.g., active autoimmune disease)\n* Concomitant use of strong Uridine glucuronyl transferases (UGT) inhibitors\n* Concomitant use of imiquimod or 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) for the duration of the study",
