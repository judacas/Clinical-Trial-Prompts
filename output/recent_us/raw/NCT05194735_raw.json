    "inclusion_criteria": "* Participants must have histologically or cytologically confirmed invasive breast cancer, with metastatic disease. Participants without pathologic or cytologic confirmation of metastatic disease should have unequivocal evidence of metastasis from physical examination or radiologic evaluation.\n* Estrogen-receptor and progesterone-receptor expression both <10% by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative by IHC or non-amplified as determined by the current American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)/CAP (College of American Pathologists) criteria. If patient has more than one histological result, the most recent one has to be considered for inclusion.\n* Participants must have measurable disease by RECIST version 1.1\n* Participants must agree to undergo a research biopsy, if tumor is safely accessible, at baseline and 7-14 days prior to Cycle 3 Day 1. Participants for whom newly-obtained samples cannot be provided (e.g. inaccessible or participant safety concern) may submit an archived specimen.\n\nNote: After the first 6 participants undergo biopsy on cabozantinib, we will review their adverse event profiles to ensure no more than a 20% rate of grade 3 or higher bleeding or wound healing complications occur. If more than 2 patients (>20%) have safety concerns, we will reassess the safety of collecting the research biopsies. Full review of all grade (including grade 1 and 2) may also prompt changes and will be reviewed by the study team. Exelixis may be consulted if necessary.\n\n* Prior chemotherapy: Participants may have received 0-3 prior chemotherapeutic regimens for metastatic breast cancer and must have been off treatment with chemotherapy for at least 14 days prior to registration. Participants should also be adequately recovered from acute toxicities of prior treatment.\n* Prior biologic therapy: Patients must have discontinued all biologic therapy at least 14 days prior to registration.\n* Prior radiation therapy: Patients may have received prior radiation therapy in either the metastatic or early-stage setting. Radiation therapy must be completed per the following timelines:\n\n  * Radiotherapy to the thoracic cavity or abdomen within 4 weeks prior to registration.\n  * Radiotherapy to bone lesions within 2 weeks prior to registration.\n  * Radiotherapy to any other site within 4 weeks prior to registration.\n* In all cases, there must be complete recovery and no ongoing complications from prior radiotherapy.\n* The subject is ≥18 years old.\n* ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status ≤1(Karnofsky ≥60%, see Appendix A)\n* Participants must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:\n\n  * absolute neutrophil count ≥1,000/microliter (mcL)\n  * platelets ≥100,000/mcL\n  * hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dl\n  * total bilirubin ≤1.5 × institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) (or 2.0 x ULN in patients with documented Gilbert's Syndrome)\n  * Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) / Alanine transaminase (ALT) ≤2.5 × institutional ULN or ≤ 3 × institutional ULN for participants with documented liver metastases\n  * creatinine <1.5 ×institutional ULN OR creatinine clearance ≥40 mL/min (using Cockcroft-Gault formula) for participants with creatinine levels above institutional ULN.\n  * Urine protein/creatinine ratio (UPCR) ≤1\n* Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at screening\n* Childbearing potential is defined as: participants who have not reached a postmenopausal state (≥ 12 continuous months of amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause) and has not undergone surgical sterilization (removal of ovaries and/or uterus).\n* Female and male participants of childbearing potential must agree to use an adequate method of contraception. Contraception is required starting with the first dose of study medication through 150 days (5 months) after the last dose of study medication . Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of < 1% per year include bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, established and proper use of hormonal contraceptives that inhibit ovulation, hormone-releasing intrauterine devices, and copper intrauterine devices. The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.\n* Participants on bisphosphonates may continue receiving bisphosphonate therapy during study treatment.\n* The participant is capable of understanding and complying with the protocol and has signed the informed consent document\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be FEMALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Major surgery within 12 weeks before the first dose of study treatment.

If the average of these three consecutive results for QTcF is ≤ 500 msec, the subject meets eligibility in this regard.\n* Thromboembolic events requiring therapeutic anticoagulation.
