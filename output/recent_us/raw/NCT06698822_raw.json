Any cancer diagnosis within the last 5 years that is considered \"treated\" and/ or on surveillance may be included in the trial.\n11. Have any condition or illness that, in the opinion of the investigator would compromise patient safety or interfere with evaluation of the study drug (including but not limited to HIV and HCV)",
