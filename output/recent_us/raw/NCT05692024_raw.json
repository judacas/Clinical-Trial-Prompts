    "official_title": "A 2-Part Open-Label Phase I Study of TAVO412 in Patients with Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors Who Progressed on Prior Approved Standard of Care Therapy",
    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Male/Female aged 18 (at the time of screening) or older.\n2. Willingness to provide written informed consent for the study.\n3. Locally relapsed or refractory disease; locally advanced disease must not be amenable to resection with curative intent.\n4. Subjects who have disease progression after treatment with available therapies that are known to confer clinical benefit, or who are intolerant to treatment, or who refuse standard treatment. There is no limit to the number of prior treatment regimens.\n5. Presence of measurable disease based on RECIST v1.1. Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to other locoregional therapy, are not considered measurable unless there has been demonstrated progression in the lesion.\n6. Part 1: Subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors who progressed, or refused, or are considered not eligible, on prior approved standard of care therapy. The following will also apply for Part 2 of the study.\n\n   1. Patients with NSCLC who have sensitizing EGFR mutations must have experienced disease progression on prior EGFR TKIs while those with tumor cMET genomic alterations or over-expression must have received prior anti-PD1 agents and platinum-based chemotherapy either in combination or sequentially.\n   2. Patients with gastric cancer or gastroesophageal cancer must have received prior cytotoxic chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, and where indicated, also received prior HER2-drected therapy or other FDA-approved targeted therapy.\n   3. Patients with colorectal cancer must have received fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan ± VEGF-targeting monoclonal antibodies as prior therapy. Patients with RAS-wild type tumors should have received approved anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody. Patients with MSI-high/dMMR colorectal cancer must have received prior immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy\n   4. Patients with TNBC must have experienced disease progression on the following as prior therapies:\n   5. Pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy (CPS ≥ 10%)\n   6. Sacituzumab\n   7. Trastuzumab-deruxtecan (HER2-low)\n7. Part 2: A new set of subjects with advanced or metastatic gastric cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), or subjects of other solid tumor types with best clinical responses (e.g., CR > PR > SD) from Part 1 that progressed on prior approved standard of care therapy.\n\n   1. For subjects with Gastric Cancer: histologically confirmed Gastric or Gastro-Esophageal Junction Carcinoma (including adenocarcinoma arising from the lower esophagus). If multiple eligible patients exist, preference will be given to enroll subjects with cMet or EGFR mutations, over-expression, or gene amplification.\n   2. For subjects with NSCLC: histologically or cytologically confirmed tumor must be NSCLC with EGFR and/or cMet mutations, over-expression, or gene amplification.\n8. Part 2: Willingness to undergo pretreatment and on-treatment tumor biopsies (core or excisional).\n\n   Note: A baseline biopsy obtained for other purposes (i.e., not a protocol-defined procedure) before signing consent may be utilized if the subject has not had any intervening systemic therapy from the time of the biopsy to the start of treatment (i.e., Cycle 1 Day 1), and if a minimum of 20 slides or preferably 1 tissue block can be submitted.\n\n   Note: If a subject is scheduled to have a tumor biopsy for the purposes of this study and it is subsequently determined that tumor tissue cannot safely be obtained, then the subject may still enroll in the study. The subject may be replaced within the cohort.\n9. For both Part 1 & Part 2, subjects willing to consent to collection of additional blood or tissue samples for exploratory biomarker or genomic analysis purposes.\n10. ECOG performance status 0 or 1.\n11. Female subjects of child-bearing potential (defined as women who have not undergone surgical sterilization with a hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy and are not postmenopausal, defined as ≥ 12 months of amenorrhea) must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening.\n\n    1. All female subjects of child-bearing potential must agree to take appropriate precautions to avoid pregnancy (with at least 99% certainty) from screening through 60 days after the last dose of study drug.\n    2. All male subjects must agree to take appropriate precautions to avoid pregnancy with a partner (with at least 99% certainty) from screening through 90 days after the last dose of study drug. Permitted methods that are at least 99% effective in preventing pregnancy (see Appendix A) should be communicated to the subjects and their understanding confirmed.\n12. Patients with prior malignancies of the same or different tumor type and patients with concurrent malignancies of the same or different tumor type will be included\n13. Patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment (defined as the equivalent of National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) grade 1 toxicity), as well as those with aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) elevations defined as grade 3 by the NCI CTCAE (> 5 to 20 x ULN (upper limit of normal)), may be asymptomatic and able to tolerate doses equivalent to patients with normal hepatic function\n14. Patients with compromised renal function must meet creatinine clearance ≥ 30 mL/minute (estimated by the Cockcroft-Gault formula, [140 - age] × body weight/plasma creatinine × 72 [× 0.85 if female])\n15. Patients with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)/Hepatitis B (HBV)/Hepatitis C (HBC) will be allowed to enter into the study provided the following criteria are met:\n\n    a) Patients with HIV infection must have CD4+ T-cell (CD4+) counts ≥ 350 cells/µL.\n16. The following eligibility criteria are for patients with evidence of chronic HBV infection or patients with history of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) or who are virologically suppressed on HCV treatment:\n\n    1. Liver-related laboratory eligibility criteria should be the same as that for the general population.\n    2. Exceptions: Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and bilirubin criteria may be less stringent in patients with cancers such as hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma in whom hepatic function based on Child-Pugh score should be used.\n    3. Patients with chronic HBV infection with active disease who meet the criteria for anti-HBV therapy should be on a suppressive antiviral therapy prior to initiation of cancer therapy.\n\n       Note: Subjects with no prior history of hepatitis B infection who have been vaccinated against hepatitis B and who have a positive antibody against hepatitis B surface antigen test as the only evidence of prior exposure may participate in the study.\n    4. Patients on concurrent HCV treatments must have HCV below the limit of quantification.\n    5. Patients with untreated HCV may be enrolled if the HCV is stable, the patient is not at risk for hepatic decompensation, and the investigational cancer treatment is not expected to exacerbate the HCV infection.\n17. Patients without a history of AIDS-defining opportunistic infections or no opportunistic infection within the past 12 months. With the exception of:\n\n    1. Patients with a history of AIDS-defining cancers (e.g., Kaposi's sarcoma, aggressive B-cell lymphoma, and invasive cervical cancer).\n    2. Patients on prophylactic antimicrobials where there may be drug-drug interactions or overlapping toxicities should if appropriate, be changed to an alternative antimicrobial, or if not, be excluded.\n18. To ensure that effective antiretroviral therapy is tolerated and that toxicities are not confused with investigational drug toxicities, trial participants should be on established ART for at least four weeks and have an HIV viral load less than 400 copies/mL prior to enrollment. However, exclusion may be based on specific ART drugs with overlapping toxicity.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
