    "official_title": "TMEM-MRI: A Pilot Feasibility Study of Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Imaging of TMEM (Tumor Microenvironment of Metastasis) in Patients With Operable Breast Cancer",
    "inclusion_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria\n\n* For pre-pilot phase (MRI sequence development):\n\n  o Patients with a breast mass, with biopsy-proven histology of invasive breast carcinoma (any histologic type and ER,PR,HER2 status)\n* For pilot phase Cohort A:\n\n  o Patients with a breast mass considered highly suspicious for invasive carcinoma by the radiologist (BIRADS 5).\n* For pilot phase Cohort B:\n\n  * Patients with a breast mass found to be invasive ductal carcinoma on core biopsy.\n  * No preoperative therapy for the current breast cancer has been started (endocrine therapy, chemotherapy, or radiation). Patients can receive preoperative treatment after TMEM-MRI is conducted, if clinically indicated.\n* For pilot phase Cohort C:\n\n  * Patients with locally advanced breast cancer, anatomic stage II-III, who received neoadjuvant therapy as per standard of care.\n  * Residual palpable mass > 1 cm in largest diameter after neoadjuvant therapy.\n  * Candidate for breast MRI before definitive surgery.\n* Tumor size/breast mass should be > 1 cm in largest diameter (radiologically).\n* Multifocal disease is allowed, as long as patients meet all eligibility criteria.\n* Age â‰¥ 18 years.\n* ECOG performance status 0-1.\n* Willingness to undergo a \"research breast MRI\".\n* Patient must be able to undergo MRI with gadolinium enhancement.\n\n  * No history of untreatable claustrophobia.\n  * No presence of non-MRI compatible metallic objects or metallic objects that, in the opinion of a radiologist, would make MRI a contraindication.\n  * No history of sickle cell disease.\n  * No contraindication to intravenous contrast administration.\n  * No known allergy-like reaction to gadolinium\n  * No known or suspected renal impairment. GFR should be greater than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2.\n* Weight less than or equal to the MRI table limit.\n* Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent.\n\nExclusion Criteria\n\n* Patients may not have had breast cancer or radiation therapy to the ipsilateral breast in the past.\n* No breast prosthetic implants (silicone or saline) are allowed.\n* Use of any investigational agent within 30 days of starting study.\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study.\n* Patients must be non-pregnant and non-lactating. Patients must have a negative pregnancy test (urine or serum) within 7 days of registration date.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
