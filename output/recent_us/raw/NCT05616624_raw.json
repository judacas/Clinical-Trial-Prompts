    "inclusion_criteria": "Patients must meet the following criteria for study entry:\n\n1. Documentation of Disease:\n\n   - Progressive castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer with pathologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate without small cell features.\n2. Patients must have Measurable or Non-measurable disease per Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 (PCWG2) response criteria (RECIST criteria will only apply to soft tissue lesions\n\n   * Measurable Disease\n\n     * For extra-nodal lesions to be considered measurable, they must be ≥ 10 mm in one dimension, using spiral CT.\n   * For lymph nodes to be considered measureable (i.e., target or evaluable lesions), they must be ≥ 20 mm in at least one dimension, using spiral CT.\n   * Non-measurable Disease\n\n     * All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter < 20 mm with conventional techniques or < 10 mm with spiral CT scan) and truly non-measurable lesions.\n     * Lesions that are considered non-measurable include bone lesions (only).\n3. Asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic metastatic CRPC defined as pain that is relieved by acetaminophen or a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory\n\n   * Asymptomatic: Score of 0-1 on BPI-SF Question #3 (worst pain in last 24 hours)\n   * Mildly symptomatic: Score of 2-3 on BPI-SF Question #3\n4. Progressive disease:\n\n   Patients must have progressive disease at study entry defined as one or more of the following three criteria that occurred while the patient was on androgen deprivation therapy. For patients enrolling on the basis of soft tissue or bone progression, the baseline scan must show progression relative to a comparison scan. If the comparison scan is not available, the baseline scan report must reference the previous scan to document progression.\n   * PSA progression defined by a minimum of two rising PSA levels with an interval of ≥ 1 week between each determination. Patients who received an anti-androgen must have progression documented by a minimum of two rising PSA levels with an interval of ≥ 1 week between each determination such that at least the second of these rises is > 4 weeks since last flutamide or > 6 weeks since last bicalutamide or nilutamide. The PSA value at the screening should be > 2 μg/L (2 ng/mL)\n   * Soft tissue disease progression is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new non-osseous lesions is also considered progression). Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial (e.g., skin nodules, palpable lymph nodes) and at least 10 mm in diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g., skin nodules). Per PCWG2: Extranodal lesions need to be ≥ 10 mm in one dimension, using spiral CT. However, lymph nodes need to be ≥ 20 mm in at least one dimension to be considered new.\n   * Bone disease progression is defined by PCWG2 as two or more new lesions on bone scan\n5. Representative formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor specimens in paraffin blocks (blocks are preferred) or at least 10 unstained slides, with an associated pathology report, for central testing of tumor PD-L1 expression\n\n   * Tumor tissue should be of good quality based on total and viable tumor content. Fine needle aspiration, brushing, cell pellet from pleural effusion, bone metastases, and lavage samples are not acceptable. For core-needle biopsy specimens, at least three cores should be submitted for evaluation.\n   * Patients who do not have tissue specimens meeting eligibility requirements may undergo a biopsy during the screening period. Acceptable samples include core needle biopsies for deep tumor tissue (minimum of three cores) or excisional, incisional, punch, or forceps biopsies for cutaneous, subcutaneous, or mucosal lesions.\n   * Tumor tissue from bone metastases is not evaluable for PD-L1 expression but will still be acceptable.\n6. Patients must have been on androgen deprivation therapy with a GnRH analogue, antagonist, or bilateral orchiectomy (i.e., surgical or medical castration) for at least 3 months prior to study entry and maintain castrate levels of serum testosterone ≤ 50 ng/dL throughout study participation unless intolerant.\n7. Adequate hematologic and end organ function, defined by the following laboratory results:\n\n   * ANC ≥ 1500 cells/uL\n   * WBC counts ≥ 2500/uL\n   * Lymphocyte count ≥ 300/uL\n   * Platelet count ≥ 100,000/uL;\n   * Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL\n   * Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) with the following exception:\n\n     * Patients with known Gilbert disease who have serum bilirubin level ≤ 3 xULN may be enrolled.\n   * AST/ALT ≤ 2.5 × institutional upper limit of normal\n\n     * For patients with documented bone metastases, AST can be ≥ 2.5x ULN if the investigator can provide evidence of no underlying liver dysfunction and thus, it is likely that the AST is originating from bone source.\n   * Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 x ULN Patients with documented bone metastases: alkaline phosphatase ≤ 5 x ULN\n   * Serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 x ULN or creatinine clearance ≤50 mL/min on the basis of the Cockcroft-Gault glomerular filtration rate estimation:\n\n     * (140- age) x (weight in kg) x (0.85 if female) 72 x (serum creatinine in mg/dL)\n   * INR and aPTT ≥1.5 x ULN - This applies only to patients who do not receive therapeutic anticoagulation; patients receiving therapeutic anticoagulation (such as low-molecular-weight heparin or warfarin) should be on a stable dose\n8. No clinically significant cardiovascular disease including:\n\n   * MI within 6 months\n   * Uncontrolled angina within 3 months\n   * CHF with NYHA class 3 or 4, or patients with NYHA class 3 or 4 in the past, unless a screening echo or MUGA performed within three months demonstrates an EF>45%\n   * History of clinically significant ventricular arrhythmias (e.g., ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, Torsades de pointes)\n   * History of Mobitz II second degree or third degree heart block without a permanent pacemaker in place\n   * Hypotension (systolic BP <86 mmHg) or bradycardia (<50 bpm) at screening\n   * Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic BP >170 mmHg or diastolic BP >105 mmHg at screening)\n9. For male patients with partners of childbearing potential, agreement (by patient and/or partner) to use highly effective form(s) of contraception (i.e., one that results in a low failure rate [<1% per year] when used consistently and correctly) and to continue its use for 6 months after the last dose of atezolizumab\n10.
