    "inclusion_criteria": "Inclusion criteria:\n\n1. Capable of giving signed informed consent, which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the ICF and in this protocol.\n2. Provision of signed and dated, written ICF prior to any mandatory study specific procedures, sampling, and analyses.\n3. Provision of signed and dated written genetic informed consent prior to collection of sample for genetic analysis (optional).\n4. 18 years or older at the time of signing the ICF.\n5. Histologically- or cytologically-documented NSCLC with locally-advanced, unresectable Stage III disease (according to the IASLC Staging Manual Version 8 [IASLC 2016]). Positron emission tomography (PET)/CT, MRI of the brain, and endobronchial ultrasound with biopsy are highly encouraged at diagnosis.\n6. Receipt of sCRT which must have been completed within 42 days prior to first IP dose administration in the study.\n\n   1. The platinum-based chemotherapy regimen must contain cisplatin or carboplatin and 1 of the following agents: etoposide, vinblastine, vinorelbine, a taxane (paclitaxel or docetaxel), or pemetrexed, according to the local standard of care (SoC) regimens. Platinum-based chemotherapy containing cisplatin or carboplatin and gemcitabine is permitted under certain conditions - refer to bullet point 6(b).\n   2. Patients must have received at least 2 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy before radiation therapy. The interval between administration of the last dose of chemotherapy regimen and start of radiation therapy must be no more than 6 weeks. Consolidation chemotherapy after radiation is not permitted.\n\n   (i) If the patient's platinum-based chemotherapy contained gemcitabine, no overlap between chemotherapy and radiation therapy is permitted.\n\n   (ii) If the patient's platinum-based chemotherapy contained any of the agents listed in (a) other than gemcitabine, an overlap of 1 cycle of chemotherapy and radiation therapy is acceptable.\n\n   (c) Patients must have received a total dose of radiation of 60 Gy ±10% (54 Gy to 66 Gy). Sites are encouraged to adhere to mean organ radiation dosing as follows: (i) Mean lung dose <20 Gy and/or V20 <35%; (ii) Mean oesophagus <34 Gy; (iii) Heart V45 <35% or V30 <30%. Note: Sites should be aware of the recent RTOG 0617 Study data demonstrating that doses higher than 60 Gy may be associated with greater toxicity and worse efficacy.\n\n   (d) Patients with WHO/ECOG PS 2 or chronic lung disease (pulmonary emphysema or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) must have received a V20 <25%.\n7. Patients must not have progressed following platinum-based sCRT, as per Investigator assessed RECIST 1.1 criteria. . In order to assess disease progression, the baseline imaging (CT/MRI) used for Screening purposes should be compared against the most recently performed scan that allows physician assessment as per RECIST 1.1 criteria. If an intermediate scan taken between chemotherapy and radiotherapy is available and that scan is suitable for physician assessment as per RECIST 1.1 criteria, then this scan should be used.\n\n   1. Patients with measurable disease and/or non-measurable and/or no evidence of disease (NED) assessed at baseline by CT/MRI will be entered in this study.\n   2. Prior irradiated lesions may be considered measurable and selected as TLs provided they fulfil the other criteria for measurability.\n8. Must have a life expectancy of at least 12 weeks at enrolment.\n9. WHO/ECOG PS ≤2.\n10. Adequate organ and marrow function at enrolment as defined below. These parameters should be achieved without augmentation by growth factors, transfusions, or infusions within 14 days of screening unless required for SoC:\n\n    1. Haemoglobin ≥9.0 g/dL;\n    2. Absolute neutrophil count >1.0 × 109/L;\n    3. Platelet count >75 × 109/L;\n    4. Serum bilirubin ≤1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN).

Women will be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrheic for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. The following age-specific requirements apply:\n\n1. Women <50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal treatments and if they have luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone levels in the post-menopausal range for the institution or underwent surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy).\n2. Women ≥50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments, had radiation-induced menopause with last menses >1 year ago, had chemotherapy-induced menopause with last menses >1 year ago, or underwent surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, or hysterectomy).\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\n1.
