    "official_title": "A Randomized Phase I Trial to Evaluate Concurrent Or Sequential Ipilimumab, Nivolumab, and Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy in Patients With Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (COSINR Study)",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* 1. Have a histologic diagnosis of stage IV NSCLC.\n* 2. Be willing and able to provide written informed consent/assent for the trial.\n* 3. Be greater than or equal to 18 years of age on day of signing informed consent.\n* 4. Have measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1 including at least two metastatic lesions that meet criteria for SBRT radiation.\n\n  a. 0.25 cc to 65 cc of viable tumor (i.e. primary disease or metastases) approximately 5cm in maximal dimension. Tumors larger than 65 cc can be partially treated\n* 5. For biopsy identified patients: Be willing to undergo repeat biopsy of a target lesion before treatment and after radiation. Subjects for whom newly-obtained samples cannot be provided (e.g. inaccessible or subject safety concern) may be exempted from this requirement after consultation with the Principal Investigator.\n* 6. Have a performance status of 0 or 1 on the ECOG Performance Scale.\n* 7. Demonstrate adequate organ function as defined in Table 1, all screening labs should be performed within 10 days of treatment initiation.\n\nTable 1 Adequate Organ Function Laboratory Values System Laboratory Value Hematological Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,500 /mcL Platelets ≥ 100,000 / mcL Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL or ≥ 5.6 mmol/L without transfusion or EPO dependency (within 7 days of assessment)\n\nRenal Serum creatinine OR Measured or calculated creatinine clearance (GFR can also be used in place of creatinine or CrCl) ≤ 1.5 X upper limit of normal (ULN) OR ≥ 50 mL/min for subject with creatinine levels > 1.5 X institutional ULN\n\nHepatic Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X ULN OR Direct bilirubin ≤ ULN for subjects with total bilirubin levels > 1.5 ULN AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 X ULN OR ≤ 5 X ULN for subjects with liver metastases Albumin ≥ 3.0 mg/dL aCreatinine clearance should be calculated per institutional standard.\n\n* 8. Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum pregnancy within 24hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required.\n* 9. Female subjects of childbearing potential should be willing to use 2 methods of birth control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course of the study through 120 days after the last dose of study medication. Subjects of childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not been free from menses for > 1 year.\n* 10. Male subjects should agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting with the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy.\n* 11. Have an investigator determined life expectancy of at least 6 months.\n* 12. Patients whose tumors known to harbor an exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R EGFR mutation must have progressed on or had intolerance to an EGFR TKI. Patients whose tumors are known to harbor an ALK translocation must have progressed on or had intolerance to an ALK inhibitor.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* 1. Has received prior chemotherapy for NSCLC with the exception of neoadjuvant or adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy for NSCLC completed >6 months prior to enrollment.\n* 2. Has prior exposure to anti-PD1/PD-L1 or anti-CTLA4 therapy.\n* 3. Is currently participating and receiving study therapy or has participated in a study of an investigational agent and received study therapy or used an investigational device within 4 weeks of the first dose of treatment.\n* 4. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy at a dose of >10mg prednisone daily or equivalent at time of first dose of trial treatment.\n* 5. Has a known history of active TB (Bacillus Tuberculosis).\n* 6. Hypersensitivity to nivolumab, ipilimumab, or any of its excipients.\n* 7. Has received radiation therapy within 2 weeks of study drug administration.\n* 8. Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment. Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical cancer.\n* 9. Patients with untreated symptomatic brain metastases. Patients with treated brain metastases will be allowed if brain imaging obtained greater than 7 days from treatment reveals stable disease. Patients with small (< 3mm) asymptomatic brain metastasis are allowed to enroll. Patients on steroids doses higher than 10 mg of prednisone (or its equivalent) are excluded.\n* 10. Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment.\n* 11. Has known history of non-infectious pneumonitis that required steroids or active pneumonitis.\n* 12. Has evidence of interstitial lung disease.\n* 13. Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.\n* 14. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.\n* 15. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial.\n* 16. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the trial, starting with the screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.\n* 17. If known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA [qualitative] is detected) then patient is not eligible for cohorts including SBRT to liver lesions.\n* 18. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy.\n\nNote: Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.\n\n* 19. Has had prior radiation therapy (defined as >10% of prior prescription dose) to the area planning to be treated with SBRT.",
