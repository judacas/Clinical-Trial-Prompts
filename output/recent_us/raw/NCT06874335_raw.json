Has heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids as evidenced by an MBL of ≥ 160 milliliter (mL) during 1 cycle or ≥ 80 mL per cycle for 2 menstrual cycles as measured by the alkaline hematin method during the screening period.\n\nKey\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be FEMALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 50 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1.
