TKIs are not permitted to be continued at screening (e.g. Gleevec)\n  * Intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy may be dosed up to 7 days prior to first dose of pembrolizumab (cytarabine [Ara-C] recommended)\n  * For biologics (e.g. monoclonal antibodies), washout period of 1 month beyond the recommended dosing interval and at least 4 weeks or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) since the last dose\n* All acute toxic effects of any prior antitumor therapy must be resolved to grade =< 1 before enrollment, with the exception of alopecia (any grade permitted), or bone marrow parameters (any grades permitted)\n* For female subjects of childbearing potential, willingness to abstain from heterosexual intercourse or use 2 concurrent protocol recommended methods of contraception from the screening visit throughout the study treatment period and to 30 days from the last dose of pembrolizumab; a negative serum pregnancy test is required for female subjects at screening; lactating females must agree to discontinue nursing before administration of study drugs\n* For male subjects having intercourse with females of childbearing potential, willingness to abstain from heterosexual intercourse or use 2 protocol-recommended methods of contraception from the start of pembrolizumab throughout the study treatment period and for 90 days following the last dose of pembrolizumab; also, male subjects should refrain from sperm donation from the start of pembrolizumab throughout the study treatment period and for 3 months following the last dose of study drugs\n* In the judgment of the investigator, participation in the protocol offers an acceptable benefit-to-risk ratio when considering current disease status, medical condition, and the potential benefits and risks of alternative treatments for the subject's ALL\n* Willingness to comply with scheduled visits, drug administration plan, imaging studies, laboratory tests, other study procedures, and study restrictions; psychological, social, familial or geographical factors that might preclude adequate study participation should be considered\n* Have the ability to understand and sign a written informed consent form, which must be obtained prior to initiation of study procedures\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
