An active myositis-associated rash OR.\n\nB. A recent muscle biopsy OR.\n\nC. An elevated CK > 3 times the upper limit of normal OR.\n\nD. Participants diagnosed IIM AND progressive Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT)\n\niii) Inadequate response to glucocorticoids and at least 2 of the following treatments used for at least 3 months: azathioprine, methotrexate, cyclosporin A, tacrolimus, MMF, cyclophosphamide, leflunomide, IVIG, and rituximab.\n\n- Diagnosis of Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) defined as follows:.\n\ni) Fulfilling 2013 EULAR/ACR classification criteria for SSc.\n\nii) Antinuclear Antibody (ANA) positive at screening or prior to screening.\n\n- SSc disease activity.\n\ni) Participants diagnosed with diffuse cutaneous SSc OR diffuse or limited cutaneous SSc AND progressive ILD, AND.\n\nii) Inadequate response to at least 1 of the following treatments used for at least 3 months: mycophenolate, cyclophosphamide, rituximab, nintedanib, azathioprine, tocilizumab, or intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG).\n\nExclusion Criteria\n\n* Diagnosis of drug-induced SLE rather than idiopathic SLE.\n* Other systemic autoimmune diseases (eg, multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, etc) are excluded. Participants with type I autoimmune diabetes mellitus, thyroid autoimmune disease, Celiac disease, or secondary Sjögren's syndrome are not excluded.\n* SLE overlap syndromes including, but not limited to, rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, and mixed connective tissue disease, are excluded.\n* Present or recent clinically significant CNS pathology, within 12 months.\n* IIM disease activity.\n\n  i) Other forms of IIM: Inclusion Body Myositis, Amyopathic DM, any form of juvenile myositis.\n\nii) Myositis other than IIM, eg, drug-induced myositis and PM associated with HIV.\n\niii) Participants with severe muscle damage (Physician VAS for muscle damage in Myositis Damage Index > 7 cm on a 10 cm scale), permanent weakness due to a non-IIM cause (eg, stroke), or myositis with cardiac involvement.\n\n- SSc disease activity.\n\ni) SSc related PAH requiring active treatment.\n\nii) Rapidly progressive SSc related lower GI (small and large intestines) involvement (requiring parenteral nutrition); active gastric antral vascular ectasia.\n\niii) Prior scleroderma renal crisis.\n\n- Other protocol-defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria apply.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
