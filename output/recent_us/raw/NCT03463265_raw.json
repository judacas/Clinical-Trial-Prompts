Pregnant women are excluded from this study because dabrafenib, and trametinib may have teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with the study drugs, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with the study drugs. Dabrafenib was teratogenic and embryotoxic in rats at doses three times greater than the human exposure at the recommended clinical dose.\n* A history or current evidence of retinal vein occlusion (RVO)\n* History of interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis\n* Patients with known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with dabrafenib and trametinib. In addition, these participants are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy.\n* Known immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reaction or idiosyncrasy to drugs chemically related to the study treatments, their excipients, and/or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).",
