Pathologically or cytologically documented locally advanced/unresectable or metastatic urothelial carcinoma of the bladder, renal pelvis, ureter, or urethra. Histological variants are allowed if urothelial histology is predominant. Small cell/neuroendocrine tumors are not allowed even if mixed histology.\n   14. Relapsed or progressed after treatment with ≥1 prior line of therapy (maximum of 3) that contains anti-PD-(L)1 therapy in the perioperative or metastatic setting. At least 1 line of therapy must also contain one of the following treatment modalities: chemotherapy or enfortumab vedotin. Prior fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)-inhibitor treatment for those who are eligible are allowed.\n\n       * Required treatments can be given in combination or sequentially\n       * Prior cisplatin-based therapy or PD-(L)1 inhibitor therapy given for the treatment of muscle invasive urothelial carcinoma is counted as 1 line of therapy\n       * The same regimen administered twice in different disease settings will be counted as 1 line of prior therapy\n       * A minimum of 20 subjects in the second-line setting who have previously received enfortumab vedotin and pembrolizumab in combination will be enrolled.\n\n       Esophageal Carcinoma\n   15.

Provides a pretreatment tumor tissue sample of sufficient quantity, as defined in the Study Laboratory Manual. The following tissue samples can be provided as the pretreatment tumor tissue sample:\n\n   1.

Pretreatment tumor biopsy from ≥1 lesion not previously irradiated and amenable to sampling after signing of the tissue ICF. The pretreatment tissue requirement may be waived after discussion and agreement with the Sponsor.\n6.
