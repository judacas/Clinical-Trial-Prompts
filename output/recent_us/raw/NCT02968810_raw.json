Renal cell carcinoma (Part B only).\n* Understand the study, be willing to comply with all study procedures and sign the informed consent\n* Adequate tumor tissue available\n* ECOG performance status of 0 or 1\n* Negative pregnancy test (females of childbearing potential)\n* Agree to use of contraception during the study until at least 90 days after final GEN-009 dose\n* Adequate hematologic, liver, and kidney function\n\nPart A-specific Inclusion:\n\n* Have completed or will complete treatment for their disease with curative intent\n* Have no evidence of disease\n\nPart B-specific Inclusion:\n\n* Receiving or will initiate treatment with nivolumab or pembrolizumab per disease as listed below:\n\n  1. NSCLC: Patients with metastatic non-squamous NSCLC beginning first-line pembrolizumab in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy, or metastatic squamous NSCLC beginning first-line pembrolizumab in combination with carboplatin and either paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel\n  2. SCCHN: Patients beginning pembrolizumab with recurrent or metastatic SCCHN with disease progression on or after a platinum-based therapy, or beginning first-line pembrolizumab for recurrent or metastatic SCCHN if tumors express PD-L1 with a Combined Positive Score (CPS) ≥ 1.\n  3. Cutaneous Melanoma: Patients with unresectable or metastatic cutaneous melanoma beginning nivolumab monotherapy or nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab.\n  4. Urothelial Carcinoma: Patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who are beginning pembrolizumab who:\n\n     1. Are not eligible for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy, and tumor is PD-L1 positive with CPS ≥ 10, or are not eligible for any platinum-containing chemotherapy, OR\n     2. Have had disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy, or within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy.\n  5. Renal Cell Carcinoma:\n\n     1. Patients with advanced RCC who have received prior anti-angiogenic therapy, and are beginning nivolumab monotherapy, OR\n     2. Untreated patients with intermediate or poor risk RCC based on the IMDC score who are beginning nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab.\n* Disease assessment by CT or MRI\n* Have at least 1 lesion that is measureable by RECIST 1.1\n* Agree to a tumor biopsy 50 days after first GEN-009 vaccination\n* Participants with hypothyroidism must be on thyroid replacement treatment\n\nGeneral\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Received a live vaccine ≤ 28 days, or a non-live vaccine ≤ 14 days, prior to the first dose of GEN-009\n* Acute or chronic skin disorders that would interfere with injection\n* Receiving immunosuppressive therapies or systemic corticosteroids. Note: Use of topical corticosteroids or inhaled corticosteroids is acceptable\n* Allergy to the vaccine adjuvant Hiltonol (poly-ICLC)\n* Active hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection\n* HIV Positive\n* History of clinically significant cardiac condition\n* History of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis\n* Had clinically active immune-mediated disease within 5 years\n* Received a prior allogeneic stem cell transplant\n* Has primary immune deficiency\n* Received a prior solid organ transplant\n* Has malignant disease, other than the tumor types being treated in this study\n* Female patient who is pregnant, breastfeeding, or who plans to become pregnant from the signing of the informed consent until ≥ 90 days from last dose of GEN-009\n* Any condition that in the judgment of the PI would make the patient inappropriate for enrollment in the study\n* Patient has received cytotoxic chemotherapy within 4 weeks of the first leukapheresis\n\nPart A-specific Exclusion Criteria:\n\n* Has received or requires more than 2 adjuvant or neoadjuvant regimens (other than surgical excisions) given with curative intent prior to first GEN-009 vaccination\n* Has not recovered or stabilized from any clinically significant toxicity associated with any prior procedure or anticancer therapy",
