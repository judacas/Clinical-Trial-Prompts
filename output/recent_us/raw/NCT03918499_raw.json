    "official_title": "A Randomized, Double-Blind, Multicenter, 3 Stage, Efficacy and Safety Study of NI-071 and US-Licensed Remicade® (Infliximab) for the Treatment of Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Patients with a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) as defined by the 2010 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) classification criteria.\n* Patients have active RA, as confirmed by the following criteria:\n\n  * ≥6 swollen joints and ≥6 tender joints at screening and baseline (28-joint count).\n  * Either C-reactive protein (CRP) ≥0.7 mg/dL (≥7.0 mg/L) or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) ≥28 mm/h at screening.\n* Patients taking methotrexate (MTX) (oral or parenteral) for at least 3 months prior to screening and at a stable dose of between 10 and 25 mg/week for at least 8 weeks. Concomitant folic/folinic acid at a dose of at least 5 mg/week is to be taken during the study; patients can start treatment with folic/folinic acid at screening if not already receiving it.\n* If the patient is currently taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), the patient must be on a stable dose for at least 4 weeks prior to screening and during the study.\n* Patients who are ≥18 and ≤75 years of age at screening.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 75 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Patients who are rated as Class IV according to the 1991 ACR revised criteria for classification of global functional status for RA.\n* Patients who have received disease-modifying anti rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), other than MTX, within a period prior to screening shorter than the washout period appropriate to the pharmacodynamic profile of the specific drug.\n* Patients who have received immunosuppressive drugs within 4 weeks prior to screening. Patients on a stable dose of oral corticosteroids (≤10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent) for ≥4 weeks prior to screening are permitted.\n* Patients who have received intra-articular, intramuscular, intravenous, or epidural injection of corticosteroids within 4 weeks prior to screening.\n* Patients who have received intra-articular sodium hyaluronate injections within 4 weeks prior to screening.\n* Patients who have received surgical therapy for RA such as synovectomy or arthroplasty within 6 months prior to screening.\n* Patients who have received arthrocentesis within 4 weeks prior to screening.\n* Patients who have had prior treatment with infliximab.\n* Patients who have had prior treatment with >1 biological drug or >1 protein kinase inhibitor for RA either as part of clinical management or during a clinical study.\n* Patients who have had prior treatment with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) inhibitors for RA who had lack of efficacy as per clinical judgment (primary failure). Patients who have discontinued TNF-α inhibitors for RA (other than infliximab) for any reason other than lack of efficacy are allowed.\n* Presence of chronic or acute infection at screening, including positive result for active tuberculosis (TB).\n* Patients with an acute infection requiring parenteral antibiotics within 4 weeks of study dosing or requiring oral/topical antibiotics within 2 weeks of study dosing.",
