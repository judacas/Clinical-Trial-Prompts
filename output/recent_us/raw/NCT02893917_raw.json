    "inclusion_criteria": "Eligibility criteria are divided into 3 sections: 1) eligibility criteria to be fulfilled prior to cell procurement, 2) Eligibility criteria to be met prior to lymphodepletion and 3) Eligibility criteria to be met prior to CAR138 T cell infusion.\n\nNote: During the period of cell procurement and CAR138 T-cell production, subjects are allowed to receive additional standard of care chemotherapy or radiation therapy to stabilize their multiple myeloma if the treating physician feels it is in the subject's best interests. For subjects requiring bridging chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy while awaiting manufacture of their CAR138-T cells, details regarding treatment(s) administered including doses, frequency, number of cycles, etc. will be collected.\n\n1. Eligibility criteria to be fulfilled prior to cell procurement\n\n   Subjects must fulfill all of the following criteria to participate in this study.\n\n   Written informed consent and HIPAA authorization for release of personal health information. Subjects must sign a consent to undergo cell procurement.\n\n   Age ≥ 18 years at the time of consent.\n\n   Karnofsky score of ≥ 60%.\n\n   Diagnosis of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (as defined by the Revised Uniform Response Criteria outlined by the IMWG\n\n   Measurable disease as defined by one or more of the following: 1) serum M-protein\n\n   ≥1.0 g/dL (≥0.5 g/dL for IgA myeloma); 2) urine M-protein ≥200 mg/24 hours; 3) involved serum free light chain level ≥10 mg/dL AND an abnormal serum free light chain ratio. Subjects with non-secretory disease and a baseline marrow burden of myeloma of at least 30% will also be eligible to participate.\n\n   Received at least 3 lines of prior chemotherapy. The prior regimens must have included an immunomodulatory agent (lenalidomide or pomalidomide) and a proteasome inhibitor (bortezomib, carfilzomib or ixazomib).\n   * Two lines of therapy will be allowed if the subject has disease that is refractory to both an immunomodulatory agent (lenalidomide or pomalidomide) and a proteasome inhibitor.\n\n   Received high dose melphalan followed by autologous stem-cell transplant (ASCT) or is not eligible for or has declined the procedure.\n\n   Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is allowed provided the subject is ≥ 1 year from immunosuppressive therapy to treat/prevent graft-versus-host disease, has no evidence of active graft-versus-host disease, and has no evidence of active infection.\n\n   Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) should be willing to use 2 methods of birth control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course of the study (starting prior to procurement), and for 6 months after the study is concluded.
