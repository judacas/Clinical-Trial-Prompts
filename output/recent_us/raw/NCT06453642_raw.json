    "official_title": "Using Autologous Epidermal Skin Micrografts to Improve Healing In Radiation Wounds: A Pilot Study",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Status post radiation treatment, with radiation-induced wound. This includes patient with moist desquamation as well as full epidermal necrosis and superficial dermal ulcerations, this wound would otherwise be allowed to heal by secondary intention;\n* Having suitable areas of treatment: All wounds in the area of interest must be at least 20 cm2 (~10 cm2 per treatment/control area);\n* The radiation injury must have a suitable adjacent irradiated control site before initiation of treatment. This will be determined by objective measurements of % wound epithelization, wound erythema, pliability, induration and thickness at enrollment;\n* Able and willing to comply with all visit, treatment and evaluation schedules and requirements;\n* Wound considered appropriate by physician to receive epidermal grafting;\n* Able to understand and provide written informed consent;\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 80 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Active tanning, including the use of tanning booths, during the course of the study;\n* Study wound exhibits clinical signs and symptoms of infection at the screening/enrollment visit;\n* Patient unable to provide donor site for epidermal harvesting;\n* Wound sites located on the face, hands or feet\n* Adverse reactions to compounds of any external agent (e.g., gels, lotions or anesthetic creams) required for use in the study, if no alternative to the said agent exists;\n* History of collagen vascular disease;\n* Active Herpes Simplex or Zoster at the time of treatment or having experienced more than three episodes of Herpes Simplex / Zoster eruption within a year of study enrollment;\n* History of immunosuppression/immune deficiency disorders (including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or use of immunosuppressive medications;\n* Significant concurrent illness, such as uncontrolled diabetes (with a hemoglobin A1C of more than 8) (i.e., any disease state that in the opinion of the Investigator would interfere with the anesthesia, treatment, or healing process);\n* Mentally incompetent, prisoner or evidence of active substance or alcohol abuse;\n* Any condition which, in the Investigator's opinion, would make it unsafe (for the subject or study personnel) to treat the subject as part of this research study;\n* Participation in another interventional study with potential exposure to an investigational drug within past 30 days;\n* Pregnant females, due to possible discomfort with the procedure even though the procedure is localized and there is no new drug.",
