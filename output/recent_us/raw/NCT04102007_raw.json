Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must commit to either abstain continuously from heterosexual sexual intercourse or to use 2 methods of reliable birth control simultaneously.

Contraception must begin 4 weeks prior to initial dosing. Reliable contraception is indicated even where there has been a history of infertility, unless due to hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy. A man who is sexually active with a WOCBP must agree to use a latex or synthetic condom, even if they had a successful vasectomy. All men must also not donate sperm during the study, for 4 weeks after the last dose of lenalidomide, and for 4 months after the last dose of daratumumab. A WOCBP must have 2 negative serum or urine pregnancy tests first within 10 to 14 days prior to the registration date.\n8. All study patients must be registered into the mandatory Revlimid REMS program and be willing and able to comply with the requirements of the REMS program.\n9. Females of reproductive potential must agree to adhere to the scheduled pregnancy testing as required in the Revlimid REMS program.\n10. At the time of registration, confirmation of adequate contraceptive method(s) should be documented in the medical record.\n11.
