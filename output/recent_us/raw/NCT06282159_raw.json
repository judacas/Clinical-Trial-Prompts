    "exclusion_criteria": "* Subject has acute promyelocytic leukemia, inversion (16), t(8;21) AML as described below. Contact Sponsor-Investigator with questions. Inversion 16 and t(8;21): CBF chromosomal abnormalities may be assessed by molecular (PCR), metaphase cytogenetics, or FISH.\n* Subject has known active CNS involvement with AML.\n* Subject has received a strong CYP3A4 inducer (APPENDIX C) within 7 days prior to the initiation of study treatment\n* Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (APPENDIX C) are contraindicated except strong CYP3A4 inhibitor antifungal azole medications (systemic itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole). For strong CYP3A4 inhibitor antifungal azole medications, the starting dose of revumenib has to be adjusted (Table 1).\n* QTc using Fridericia's correction [QTcF]) > 450 msec. Drugs that prolong QTc should be avoided if possible. A list of common QTc prolonging drugs and alternatives that are not QTc prolonging can be found in APPENDIX D.\n* Subject has tested positive for HIV (due to potential drug-drug interaction between antiretroviral medications and Midostaurin/revumenib). Note: HIV testing is not required.\n* Subject is known to be positive for hepatitis B or C infection with the exception of those with an undetectable viral load within 3 months. (Hepatitis B or C testing is not required). Subjects with serologic evidence of prior vaccination to HBV [i.e., HBs Ag-, and antiHBs+] are allowed.\n* Subject has consumed grapefruit, grapefruit products, Seville oranges (including marmalade containing Seville oranges) or Star fruit within 3 days prior to the initiation of study treatment.\n* Subject has a cardiovascular disability status of New York Heart Association Class ≥ 2.
