Two acceptable methods of birth control thus include the following:\n\n  * A condom (barrier method of contraception) AND One of the following is required:\n  * Established and ongoing use of oral, injected, or implanted hormonal method of contraception by the female partner\n  * Placement of an intrauterine device or intrauterine system by the female partner\n  * Additional barrier method: Contraceptive sponge or occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository by the female partner\n  * Tubal ligation in the female partner performed at least 6 months before screening\n  * Vasectomy or other procedure resulting in infertility (eg, bilateral orchiectomy), performed at least 6 months before screening\n* While receiving chemotherapy, the patient must use a condom if having sex with a pregnant woman.\n* Must agree not to donate sperm from first dose of study drug through 3 months after the last dose of study drug.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be MALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Prior treatment for prostate cancer, including ADT, orchiectomy, antiandrogens, ketoconazole, abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide.\n* Prior radiation to the prostate.\n* Use of other investigational agent for prostate cancer.\n* No active secondary malignancy\n* Chronic liver disease or abnormal liver function:\n\n  * Total bilirubin greater than ULN (NOTE: in subjects with Gilbert's syndrome, if total bilirubin is greater than ULN, measure direct and indirect bilirubin and if direct bilirubin is within normal range, subject may be eligible) or\n  * Alanine (ALT) or aspartate (AST) aminotransferase greater than 2.0 x ULN or\n  * ALT or aspartate AST greater than 1.5 x ULN concomitant with alkaline phosphatase greater than 2.5 x ULN.\n* Peripheral neuropathy grade greater than 1.\n* Active cardiac disease defined as active angina, symptomatic congestive heart failure, or myocardial infarction within the previous 6 months.\n* Major surgery within 4 weeks before screening.\n* Patients with known psychological or sociological conditions, addictive disorders or family problems, which would preclude compliance with the protocol.\n* Herbal supplements that have been shown to modulate testosterone or androgen signaling (e.g. Saw Palmetto) are not allowed while on study.\n* Subjects may not be enrolled concurrently on other treatment studies. Any concurrent disease, infection, or comorbid condition that interferes with the ability of the patient to participate in the trial; places the patient at undue risk; or complicates the interpretation of the data, in the opinion of the investigator or medical monitor.\n* Subjects who will be receiving Ferumoxytol MRI tracer must:\n\n  * Not have any known hypersensitivity to Feraheme or any of its components\n  * Must not have a history of allergic reaction to any intravenous iron product.\n  * Must not have a known iron overload (based on medical history)",
