Subjects requiring analgesic treatment must be on a stable regimen before participating in the study. Symptomatic lesions amenable by palliative radiotherapy (e.g., bone metastases or metastases causing nerve damage) should be treated prior to enrolment. For the asymptomatic metastatic lesions whose further growth would likely cause functional defects or intractable pain, if appropriate, local treatment should be considered before enrolment;\n* Subjects with known central nervous system (CNS) or meningeal metastasis;\n* Subjects who have uncontrolled pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, or ascites requiring recurrent drainage procedures;\n* Subjects who are allergic or hypersensitive to LM-302 (The excipients are L-Glutamic acid, L-Arginine, Trehalose dihydrate and polysorbate 80 (for injection)) or similar products;\n* Subjects who have received the treatment targeting to CLDN18.2 or Monomethyl Auristatin E(MMAE) based Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs):\n* Subjects who have received the treatment with ADCs targeting to CLDN18.2 are not eligible;\n* Subjects who were intolerable to the treatment with MMAE based ADCs or anti-CLDN18.2 antibodies are not eligible, but can be enrolled if they were tolerable to the treatments and have experienced a 28-day's washout period prior to 1st dosing of LM-302;\n* For Phase Ib (Dose Expansion), subjects who were not response to the treatment with MMAE based ADCs or anti-CLDN18.2 antibodies are not eligible;\n* Administrate strong inhibitors/strong inducers of CYP3A4 within 14 days prior to 1st dosing of LM-302;\n* Subjects with known active keratitis or corneal ulcerations.

Otherwise, if HBV infection was indicated, those with HBV DNA < 500 IU/ML (or equivalent level) and normal liver function, combined with clinical manifestations, judged by the investigator to exclude active infection can be enrolled;\n* Subjects with positive HCV antibody but negative hepatitis C virus RNA test results and normal liver function are eligible.\n* Child-bearing potential female who have positive results in pregnancy test or are lactating;\n* Subjects who have psychiatric illness or disorders that may preclude study compliance;\n* Subject who is judged as not eligible to participate in this study by the investigator.",
