If urinalysis reveals proteinuria of 2+ or 500mg/dL greater based on the scale below, the patient will need to undergo a 24 hour urine collection, if the patient has 2000mg/24 hour or great of protein in the 24 hour the urine collection they are NOT ELIGIBLE for the study. If urinalysis protein is negative, trace, 1+, or urinalysis protein is reported in the range 0-499mg/dL protein, the patient IS ELIGIBLE to enroll on the study and does not need to complete a 24 hour urine collection:\n\n    1. 1+ = 200 - 500 mg/24 hours\n    2. 2+ = 500 - 1500 mg/24 hours\n    3. 3+ = over 2500 mg/24 hours\n    4. 4+ = over 3000 mg/24 hours.\n23. Uncontrolled blood pressure defined as consistently elevated blood pressure with a Systolic BP>140 mmHg or diastolic BP >90 mmHg in spite of an optimized regimen of antihypertensive medication are not able to enroll on the study. However, patients with borderline, isolated, or occasional elevation of blood pressure readings are eligible to enroll on the trial. If the treating physician believes the blood pressure elevation is transient the patient may enroll and blood pressure will be monitored during the study. Patients with persistent hypertension may be initiated on antihypertensive medication by the treating physician if deemed necessary and may enroll on the study. The treating physician may also adjust antihypertensive medication in the attempt to achieve a normal blood pressure while the patient is in screening and on study. It is at the discretion of the enrolling physician to continue adjusting the hypertension medication while the patient is enrolled and treated on the study to maintain adequate blood pressure readings.\n24. HIV-infected participants with a history of Kaposi's sarcoma and/or Multicentric Castleman's Disease.\n25.
