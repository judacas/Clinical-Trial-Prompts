    "official_title": "A Prospective Study of Conventional Bone Marrow Biopsies and Bone Marrow Biopsies Performed Through the Portomar(TM), Using a Modified PROMIS Pain Intensity Scale for Pain Assessment",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* • Patients with a previous bone marrow disorder diagnosis who will require multiple bone marrow biopsies over the course of their treatment, for example patients with plasma cell dyscrasia or leukemia.\n\n  * Men and non-pregnant women of age ≥ 21 years with ECOG performance status ≤ 2.\n  * Any hematologic (platelets above 50, ANC > 1.0, hemoglobin > 7), renal (patients not on dialysis), or hepatic (patients with bilirubin below 2.5) function status suitable to undergo port implantation and subsequent bone marrow biopsies.\n  * Patients must be able to understand and be willing to sign a voluntary informed consent form and agree to compliance with the protocol schedule; with the knowledge that they may withdraw consent at any time without impact on future medical care.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 21 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* • Patients with any other ongoing, concomitant, comorbid illness including but not limited to uncontrolled diabetes, NYHA class III or worse heart failure, uncontrolled coronary artery disease/arrhythmia.\n\n  * Patients unable to comply with the study schema.\n  * Confirmed pregnancy at time of screening or on implantation day prior to anesthesia/sedation.\n  * Patients unable to come off of anticoagulation medications for their procedure.\n  * Patients with active infection.\n  * Patients with < 0.5 cm or > 2.5 cm of soft tissue between screw head and skin at the target site of implantation. This is based on the patient's prior imaging studies (i.e. CT/MR or ultrasound imaging).\n  * Patient has contra-indication to conscious sedation or anesthesia services\n  * Patients who have had prior bone marrow biopsy within 2 weeks of the study biopsy.\n  * Patients with coagulopathy such that INR cannot be corrected < 2.0.\n  * Patients who are prisoners or wards of the court.\n  * Patients with alcohol or substance abuse disorder defined by DSM V criteria.\n  * Patients with the diagnosis of a major psychiatric disorder such as schizophrenia or major depression defined by the DSM-V criteria.\n  * Patients with osteoporosis defined as L1 vertebrae bone density lower than 90 Hounsfield units",
