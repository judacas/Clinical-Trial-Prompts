Tumor types of origin include gastric, pancreatic, hepatobiliary, colorectal, and sarcoma. Tumors may be primary or metastatic to solid or hollow intra-abdominal organs.\n5. Subject must understand the investigational nature of this study and sign an Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board approved written informed consent.\n6.

Renal dysfunction as defined as a GFR < 45.\n3. Liver dysfunction as defined by Child-Pugh score > 5, or LFT's 1.5x above normal range.\n4. Any known allergy or prior reaction to fluorescein or a positive skin prick test to fluorescein.\n5. Pregnant or nursing female subjects, determined preoperatively with a urine pregnancy test.\n6. Unwilling or unable to follow protocol requirements.\n7. Any condition which in the Investigators' opinion deems the patient unsuitable (e.g., abnormal EKG, including T wave inversion, elevated T waves, prolonged QRS interval, or conduction blocks) or that requires further work-up (including cardiac echo or stress test).\n8. Any condition that excludes surgery as the standard of care (e.g. high disease burden where alternative treatments like systemic chemotherapy would be preferred).",
