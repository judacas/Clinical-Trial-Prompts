    "official_title": "Rifaximin for Infection Prophylaxis in Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation",
    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Allogeneic HSCT recipients between the ages of 2 and 21 years.\n2. Underlying hematologic malignancy, regardless of donor type or graft source.\n3. Myeloablative conditioning regimen.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 2 Years\nMust have maximum age of 21 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Known hypersensitivity to rifaximin, or other rifamycin antimicrobial agents.\n2. Minimally toxic conditioning regimen (e.g. low dose TBI based). Since these regimens induce minimal myelosuppression and gut injury, patients receiving them probably stand little to gain from antibiotic prophylaxis.\n3. Patients with ongoing bacterial, viral or fungal active infections are not eligible for this study. Patients who remain on broad spectrum antibiotics for the treatment of a previous infection are not eligible.\n4. The use of prophylactic antibiotics is not permitted.\n5.
