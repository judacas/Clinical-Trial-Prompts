Patients with rapid progression on atezolizumab and bevacizumab (defined as patients who progressed radiographically in the first restaging scan that necessitates change in treatment) are excluded.\n* Washout period >= 4 weeks prior to registration is required since last atezolizumab and bevacizumab dose.\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 0 or 1.

    "exclusion_criteria": "* Any of the following because this study involves an investigational agent whose genotoxic, mutagenic and teratogenic effects on the developing fetus and newborn are unknown\n\n  * Pregnant persons\n  * Nursing persons\n  * Persons of childbearing potential who are unwilling to employ adequate contraception.\n* Major surgery =< 4 weeks prior to registration.\n* Liver directed therapy (transarterial chemoembolization [TACE], Y-90, liver directed radiation) =< 28 days prior to registration. Prior liver directed therapy > 28 days prior to registration is allowed as long as patient has at least one measurable untreated lesion by RECIST v1.1.\n* Patients with rapid progression on atezolizumab and bevacizumab (who progressed radiographically in the first restaging scan that necessitates change in treatment) are excluded.\n* Prior treatment =< 4 weeks prior to registration with anti-CTLA-4 antibody for HCC.\n* Comorbid systemic illnesses or other severe concurrent disease which, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study or interfere significantly with the proper assessment of safety and toxicity of the prescribed regimens.\n* Immunocompromised patients and patients known to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive and currently receiving antiretroviral therapy.\n\n  * Note: Patients known to be HIV positive, but without clinical evidence of an immunocompromised state, are eligible for this trial.\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to:\n\n  * Ongoing or active infection excluding hepatitis C virus (HCV)\n  * Symptomatic congestive heart failure\n  * Unstable angina pectoris\n  * Unstable cardiac arrhythmia\n  * Psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n  * Active infection including tuberculosis (clinical evaluation that includes clinical history, physical examination and radiographic findings, and tuberculosis [TB] testing in line with local practice), hepatitis B (known positive hepatitis B virus [HBV] surface antigen [HBsAg] result). Patients with a past or resolved HBV infection (defined as the presence of hepatitis B core antibody [anti-HBc] and absence of HBsAg) are eligible. Patients with chronic HBV infection as evidenced by detectable HBV surface antigen or HBV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) are eligible if on antiviral therapy and have HBV DNA < 100 IU/mL. Patients with active or resolved hepatitis C (HCV) infection as evidenced by detectable HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) or antibody are eligible.\n* Receiving any other investigational agent which would be considered as a treatment for the primary neoplasm =< 4 weeks prior to registration.\n* Other active malignancy =< 2 years prior to registration. Exceptions: Non-melanotic skin cancer or carcinoma-in-situ of the cervix.\n* History of myocardial infarction =< 6 months, or congestive heart failure requiring use of ongoing maintenance therapy for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias.\n* History of allogenic organ transplantation.\n* Active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders (including inflammatory bowel disease [e.g., colitis or Crohn's disease], diverticulitis [with the exception of diverticulosis], systemic lupus erythematosus, sarcoidosis syndrome, or Wegener syndrome [granulomatosis with polyangiitis, graves' disease, rheumatoid arthritis, hypophysitis, uveitis, etc]).
