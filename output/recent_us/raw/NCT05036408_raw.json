    "inclusion_criteria": "* The subject provides written informed consent and is willing and able to comply with study requirements.\n* At screening the subject has a minimum body mass index (BMI) of 16 kg/m2 and a minimum body weight of 33 kg up to a maximum body weight of 129 kg, inclusive. If subject is considered to be underweight or overweight/obese, the subject is otherwise healthy in the opinion of the investigator.\n* The subject has celiac disease characterized at Screening Visit by:\n* a history of biopsy-confirmed celiac disease; and\n* no known gluten exposure for at least 10 days; and\n* willingness to maintain a gluten-free diet for the duration of the study; and\n* a negative or weak positive transglutaminase (tTG)-specific IgA titer if the subject has a normal total immunoglobulin A (IgA) titer or has a partial IgA deficiency OR\n* a negative or weak positive deamidated gliadin peptide (DGP)-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) titer if the subject has IgA deficiency.\n* The male subject or female subject of childbearing potential will practice medically approved contraception during the study.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 75 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* The subject has a history of clinically confirmed immunoglobulin E-mediated reaction and/or anaphylaxis to wheat (i.e., \"wheat allergy\"), barley or rye.\n* The subject has a known history of hypersensitivity or allergies to TIMP-GLIA components OR any other known severe hypersensitivity or allergic reaction (resulted in hospitalization [initial or prolonged], congenital anomaly, or disability, or that required medical intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage) to any other allergens (medications, food or environmental).\n* The subject has uncontrolled celiac disease and/or complications of celiac disease, or otherwise has experienced celiac symptomology within 10 days of screening, in the opinion of the investigator.\n* The subject has a history of, or has an active, significant, clinically relevant, comorbidity (including Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes mellitus and other autoimmune disorders, splenectomy) that, in the opinion of the investigator, would make the subject unsuitable for participation in the study and/or could adversely affect interpretation of the study results.\n* The subject has had significant changes to or anticipates changes to prescription or non-prescription medication used to manage an underlying comorbidity within 30 days prior to first dosing (Day 1).\n* The subject is currently taking or received systemic biologics 6 months prior to first dosing (Day 1).\n* The subject has a compromised immune system, e.g.\n* known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or positive for HIV antibodies at Screening or\n* immunosuppressive medical treatment taken during the 2 months prior to first dosing (Day 1) or\n* immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids (more than 20 mg of prednisone given daily for 2 weeks or more within 2 months prior to first dosing (Day 1), or any dose of corticosteroids within 30 days of first dosing (Day 1), or high dose inhaled corticosteroids [>960 µg/day of beclomethasone dipropionate or equivalent]) within 30 days of first dosing Day 1.\n* The subject has currently untreated or active gastrointestinal disease such as peptic ulcer disease, esophagitis (Los Angeles Classification ≥ Grade C), irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, or microscopic colitis.\n* The subject has an active malignancy, or history of malignancy or chemotherapy, within the past 5 years other than history of localized or surgical removal of focal basal cell skin cancer, cervical cancer in situ treated successfully in the past by local treatment (including but not limited to cryotherapy or laser therapy) or by hysterectomy.\n* The subject has known liver disease or serology positive for hepatitis C infection; positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) at Screening Visit.\n* The subject has a positive test result for drugs of abuse, cannabinoids, or alcohol at Screening Visit or at Check-in.\n* The subject has a history of any drug or alcohol abuse in the past 5 years or alcohol consumption habits that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with the subject's ability to comply with the study requirements.\n* The subject has clinically significant laboratory test results (e.g., liver tests) or electrocardiogram (EGC) abnormalities (e.g., cardiac conduction abnormalities) at Screening\n* The subject received a live or inactive vaccine within 28 days prior or a subunit vaccine within 14 days prior to first dosing/Day 1 or the subject has a planned vaccination during the study.",
