Note: additional lines of chemotherapy, biologic or immunotherapy are allowed.\n* Recovery from effects of recent surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy\n* At least 4 weeks out from their last dose of radiation therapy\n* At least 4 weeks post-op from any major surgical procedure\n* At least 3 weeks out from their last dose of chemotherapy and/or biologic/targeted therapy\n* Must be ≥ 18 years of age\n* Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) of ≥ 70%\n* Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 14 days prior to commencement of study treatment\n* Women of child bearing potential must use an effective form of contraception during study and for at least 6 months after completion of study treatment\n* Laboratory Test Findings performed within 14 days prior to initiation of study drug showing:\n* Bone marrow function:\n\n  * Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,000/mcL\n  * Platelets ≥ 75,000/mcL\n  * Hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL\n* Renal function:\n\n  °Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN\n* Hepatic function:\n\n  * Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN\n  * AST and ALT ≤ 2.5 x ULN\n* Resolution of all acute toxic effects of prior therapy to NCI CTCAE (Version 5.0) Grade ≤ 1, with the exception of unresolved Grade 2 neuropathy and Grade 2 alopecia, which are allowed\n* Patient has recovered from any prior radiotherapy\n* Patients must be able to swallow tablets whole, without crushing\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be FEMALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* History of another invasive malignancy (other than non-melanoma skin cancer or curatively treated in situ carcinoma) with evidence of disease within the past 3 years\n* History of prior hormonal therapy (i.e., megesterol acetate, tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors) for treatment of cancer within 28 days before starting study drug\n* Any psychological, familial, sociological or geographic condition that would potentially hamper compliance with the study protocol\n* Known brain metastasis which have not been treated or showed stability for ≥ 6 months\n* Patient has received an oral or IV corticosteroid within the prior 28 days and requires chronic corticosteroid therapy (excludes use of steroid premeds for CT allergy)\n* Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic BP ≥ 160 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥ 95mmHg) despite medical treatment.
