    "official_title": "A Phase 1 Dose Escalation and Expansion Study of EO-3021, an Anti-claudin 18.2 (CLDN18.2) Antibody Drug Conjugate, in Patients With Solid Tumors Likely to Express CLDN18.2",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Availability of tumor tissue (archived and fresh tumor biopsy, if medically feasible)\n* Select advanced or metastatic solid tumor that is likely to express CLDN18.2 such as gastric/GEJ, pancreatic and esophageal cancer\n* ≥ 18 years of age\n* ECOG performance status (PS) 0 or 1 at Screening\n* Progressed on or after standard therapy, or are intolerable for available standard therapy, or there is no available standard therapy\n* Have at least one measurable extra-cranial lesion as defined by RECIST v1.1\n* Adequate organ function\n* Life expectancy > 12 weeks\n* Ability to understand the nature of this study, comply with protocol requirements, and give written informed consent\n* Willingness of men and women of reproductive potential to observe conventional and effective birth control for the duration of treatment and for 3 months following study completion\n\nKey\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Pregnant or breastfeeding\n* Symptomatic or untreated brain metastases\n* Have previously received CLDN18.2 antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) or any ADC containing an auristatin payload (prior monoclonal antibody against CLDN18.2 may be eligible)\n* Have peripheral neuropathy Grade ≥2\n* Have history of non-infectious pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease\n* Have diagnosis of another malignancy, or history of systemic treatment for invasive cancer within last 3 years. Note: Patients with Stage I cancer who have received definitive local treatment and are considered unlikely to recur are eligible. Diagnosis of non-melanoma skin cancer, carcinoma in situ of the cervix or breast, or noninvasive tumor does not affect eligibility\n* Have active ocular surface disease at baseline (based on screening ophthalmic examination)\n* Have serious concurrent illness or clinically relevant active bacterial, fungal or viral infection\n* Have previous hypersensitivity to any known components of EO-3021 or history of severe infusion reaction or hypersensitivity (CTCAE Grade 3 or higher) with monoclonal antibody treatment\n* Clinically significant cardiac disease, including but not limited to symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina, acute myocardial infarction within 6 months of planned first dose, or unstable cardiac arrhythmia requiring therapy (including torsades de pointes)\n* Have history of allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or solid organ transplantation with ongoing systemic immunosuppressive therapy\n* Patients who are not appropriate candidates for participation in this clinical study for any other reason as deemed by the Investigator",
