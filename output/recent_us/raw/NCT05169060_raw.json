Anticipated need for in-patient hospitalization or in-patient surgery from Day 1 to Day 57.\n3. Treatment with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), imiquimod, ingenol mebutate, diclofenac, photodynamic therapy, or other treatments for Actinic Keratosis (AK) within the treatment area or within 2 cm of the treatment area, within 8 weeks prior to the Screening visit.\n4. Use of the following therapies and/or medications within 2 weeks prior to the Screening visit:\n\n   * Cosmetic or therapeutic procedures (e.g., use of liquid nitrogen, surgical excision, curettage, dermabrasion, medium or greater depth chemical peel, laser resurfacing) within the treatment area or within 2 cm of the selected treatment area\n   * Acid-containing therapeutic products (e.g., salicylic acid or fruit acids, such as alpha and beta-hydroxyl acids and glycolic acids), topical retinoids, or light chemical peels within the treatment area or within 2 cm of the selected treatment area\n   * Topical salves or topical steroids within the treatment area or within 2 cm of the selected treatment area\n   * Artificial tanners within the treatment area or within 5 cm of the selected treatment area\n5.
