    "official_title": "A Phase 1 Study of MOMA-313 Given as Monotherapy or in Combination With a PARP Inhibitor in Participants With Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors",
    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Age ≥ 18 years\n2. Have histologically confirmed disease for each treatment arm as follows:\n\n   1. Treatment Arm 1 (MOMA-313 Monotherapy)\n\n      - Advanced or metastatic solid tumors that are not eligible for curative therapy, with any HR-deficient alteration, and have been previously exposed to a PARP inhibitor.\n   2. Treatment Arm 2 (MOMA-313 in Combination with Olaparib):\n\n      * Dose escalation: Advanced or metastatic solid tumors that are not eligible for curative therapy, for which a PARP inhibitor is indicated, with select HR-deficient mutations. Patients may be PARP inhibitor naive or exposed.\n      * Dose optimization: Metastatic prostate cancer, metastatic breast cancer, or metastatic pancreatic cancer with select HR-deficient mutations. Patients must be PARP inhibitor naive.\n3. Have at least 1 lesion at baseline (measurable or non-measurable) suitable for repeat imaging evaluation by RECIST and/or PCWG-3\n4. ECOG PS ≤ 2\n5. Fully recovered from clinically relevant effects of prior therapy, radiotherapy, and/or surgery **hormonal therapy allowed. Palliative radiotherapy allowed.\n6. Adequate organ function per local labs\n7. Comply with contraception requirements\n8. Written informed consent must be obtained according to local guidelines\n\nKey\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Active prior or concurrent malignancy (some exceptions allowed)\n2. Clinically relevant cardiovascular disease\n3. Known CNS metastasis associated with progressive neurological symptoms (stable doses of corticosteroids allowed)\n4. Known active infection\n5. Prior polymerase theta inhibitor exposure\n6. Known allergy, hypersensitivity, and/or intolerance to MOMA-313\n7. Olaparib exposed patients with significant toxicity or known hypersensitivity to PARP inhibitors (for patients considered for olaparib only)\n8. Impaired GI function that may impact absorption.\n9. Patient is pregnant or breastfeeding.\n10. Known to be HIV positive, unless all of the following criteria are met:\n\n    1. Undetectable viral load or CD4+ count ≥300 cells/μL\n    2. Receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy\n    3. No AIDS-related illness within the past 12 months\n11. Active liver disease (some exceptions are allowed)\n12. Prior or ongoing condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that, in the investigator's opinion, may affect safety of the patient, confound the results of the study, and/or interfere with the patients participation in the study",
