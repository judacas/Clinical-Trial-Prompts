    "official_title": "A Feasibility Study of Bridging Radiation to All Sites of FDG-Avid Disease for Commercial CAR T-Cell Infusion in Patients With Large B-Cell Lymphoma",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Documented informed consent of the participant and/or legally authorized representative.\n\n  * Assent, when appropriate, will be obtained per institutional guidelines.\n* Age: >= 18 years.\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) =< 2 or Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) >= 60.\n* Histologically confirmed large B-cell lymphoma.\n* Relapsed/refractory disease.\n* Planned to undergo commercial CAR T-cell infusion within 3 months of enrollment.\n* 6 or fewer sites (treatable with a maximum of 3 isocenters) of FDG-PET avid disease, treatable with a a maximum of 3 isocenters.\n* Measurable disease e.g., at least 1.5 cm on CT/MRI or by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 (RECIST 1.1).\n* Fully recovered from the acute toxic effects (except alopecia) to =< grade 1 to prior anti-cancer therapy.\n* Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP): negative urine or serum pregnancy test (performed within 30 days prior to day 1 of protocol therapy).\n\n  * If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Prior CD19-directed therapy.\n* Radiation therapy within 21 days prior to day 1 of protocol therapy.\n* Central nervous system (CNS) disease.\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to study agent.\n* Active diarrhea.\n* Clinically significant uncontrolled illness.\n* Active infection requiring antibiotics.\n* Other active malignancy.\n* Females only: Pregnant.\n* Any other condition that would, in the investigator's judgment, contraindicate the patient's participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns with clinical study procedures.\n* Prospective participants who, in the opinion of the investigator, may not be able to comply with all study procedures (including compliance issues related to feasibility/logistics).",
