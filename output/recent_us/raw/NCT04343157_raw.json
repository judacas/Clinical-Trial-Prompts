Agreement by females and males of childbearing potential* to use an adequate method of birth control (hormonal contraception is inadequate) or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course of the study through 30 days after the last dose of study medication. See Appendix B for guidelines.\n\n- Childbearing potential defined as not being surgically sterilized (men and women) or have not been free from menses for > 1 year (women only).\n\nLaboratory Criteria (to be performed within 14 days prior to Day 1)\n\n* 8.

Intercurrent or historic medical condition that increases subject risk in the opinion of the Investigator.
