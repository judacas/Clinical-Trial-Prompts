    "inclusion_criteria": "* Capable of giving signed informed consent which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the informed consent form (ICF) and in this protocol\n* Stage III NSCLC (AJCC 7th and 8th edition) patients who received standard chemoradiation followed by durvalumab therapy with either progressive disease or persistent disease. Persistent disease defined as residual positron emission tomography (PET) avidity 6 months after completion of initial definitive therapy and confirmed with biopsy\n* For lung adenocarcinoma patients, patients must not harbor any EGFR sensitizing mutations, ALK fusion, ROS1 rearrangements, RET fusions, or MET exon 14 skipping mutations where there are standard of care therapy options available. For patients with histologies other than adenocarcinoma, EGFR and ALK status is not required. Adenocarcinoma patients may be consented prior to the EGFR, ALK, and ROS1 status being known, but EGFR, ALK, and ROS1 status must be determined prior to initiating therapy. EGFR, ALK, and ROS ALK status may be determined using either tumor- or plasma-based, Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA)-certified assays. For patients with NSCLC, not otherwise specified (NOS), EGFR testing is not required, as the frequency of alterations is exceedingly rare in this histology\n* Cohort A: Oligoprogressive disease is defined as having 3 or fewer lesions of progression (sites can be local, distant, or both). Multiple mediastinal lesions will be counted as 1 lesion\n* Cohort B: Polyprogressive disease defined as having greater than 3 lesions of progression (sites can be local, distant, or both).

This 28 day washout period is not required for durvalumab. If sufficient wash-out time has not occurred due to the schedule or pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of an agent, a longer wash-out period will be required, as agreed by AstraZeneca and the investigator\n* Any unresolved toxicity National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade >= 2 from previous anticancer therapy with the exception of alopecia, vitiligo, and the laboratory values defined in the inclusion criteria\n\n  * Patients with grade >= 2 neuropathy will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis after consultation with the study physician\n  * Patients with irreversible toxicity not reasonably expected to be exacerbated by treatment with durvalumab may be included only after consultation with the study physician\n* Any concurrent chemotherapy (with the exception of protocol directed chemotherapy in the polyprogression cohort), investigational product (IP), biologic, or hormonal therapy for cancer treatment.

Brain metastases must be treated prior to enrolment and demonstrate radiographic stability (defined as 2 brain images, both of which are obtained after treatment to the brain metastases. These imaging scans should both be obtained at least four weeks apart and show no evidence of intracranial progression). Treated brain metastases will be counted as lesions treated as part of the protocol. In addition, any neurologic symptoms that developed either as a result of the brain metastases or their treatment must have resolved or be stable either, without the use of steroids, or are stable on a steroid dose of =< 10mg/day of prednisone or its equivalent and anticonvulsants for at least 14 days prior to the start of treatment\n* Mean QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) >= 470 ms calculated from 3 electrocardiograms (ECGs) (within 15 minutes at 5 minutes apart)\n* History of active primary immunodeficiency\n* Active infection including tuberculosis (clinical evaluation that includes clinical history, physical examination and radiographic findings, and tuberculosis (TB) testing in line with local practice), hepatitis B (known positive hepatitis B virus [HBV] surface antigen (HBsAg) result), hepatitis C patients with a past or resolved HBV infection (defined as the presence of hepatitis B core antibody [anti-HBc] and absence of HBsAg) are eligible.
