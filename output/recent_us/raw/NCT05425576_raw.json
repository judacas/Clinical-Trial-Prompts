No more than one prior line of systemic treatment is allowed (re-challenge with the same initial regimen is not allowed)\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance status score of 0 or 1\n* Adequate hematologic counts without transfusional or growth factor support within 2 weeks of study drug initiation\n* Adequate hepatic and renal function (CrCl ≥30mL/min)\n* Individual must have at least a 3-month life expectancy\n* Have measurable disease by Computed Tomography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria\n\nKey\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Have had a prior anti-cancer biologic agent within 4 weeks prior to study Day 1 or have had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, radiation therapy within 2 weeks prior to Study Day 1\n* Have not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1) from adverse events due to a previously administered agent\n* Have previously received topoisomerase I inhibitors\n* Have an active second malignancy\n* Have known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Individuals with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they have stable CNS disease for at least 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug and all neurologic symptoms have returned to baseline, have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases and are taking ≤20 mg/day of prednisone or its equivalent. All individuals with carcinomatous meningitis are excluded regardless of clinical stability\n* Additional cohort specific exclusion criteria\n\nNote: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.",
