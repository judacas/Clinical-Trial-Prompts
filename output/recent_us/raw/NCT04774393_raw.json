All modalities including prior fractionated external beam photon/proton radiotherapy, stereotactic radiosurgery, and/or or brachytherapy are permissible with a required interval of 6 months from last prior radiotherapy treatment, unless radiation given outside of the planned field, then within 2 weeks from prior radiotherapy treatment.

Corticosteroid dose must be less than or equal to 2 mg and at a stable or decreasing for at least 5 days prior to the scan. If steroids are added or the steroid dose is increased between the date of the screening MRI and the start of treatment, a new baseline MRI is required\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to comply with scheduled visits, treatment schedule, laboratory testing, and other requirements of the study, including disease assessment by MRI, as confirmed by signing a written informed consent document\n* The effects of pembrolizumab on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason:\n\n  * Male participants:\n\n    ** A male participant must agree to use a contraception during the treatment period and for 120 days after the last dose of study treatment and refrain from donating sperm during this period\n  * Female participants:\n\n    * A female participant is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant, not breastfeeding, and at least one of the following conditions applies:\n\n      * Not a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) OR\n      * A WOCBP who agrees to follow the contraceptive guidance during the treatment period and for at least 120 days after the last dose of study treatment\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* WOCBP who has a positive urine pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to allocation. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required\n* Tumors that are primarily localized to the brainstem or spinal cord, NOTE: patients with known tumors in these areas that are not progressive are not excluded\n* Known metastasis outside if the central nervous system (CNS), however, no baseline staging is required\n* Evidence of intratumoral or peritumoral hemorrhage on baseline MRI scan other than those that are grade =< 1 and either post-operative or stable on at least 2 consecutive MRI scans\n* Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent or with an agent directed to another stimulatory or co-inhibitory T-cell receptor (e.g., cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), OX-40, CD137)\n* Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug. Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster (chicken pox), yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine.
