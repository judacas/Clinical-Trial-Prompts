If the patient has liver metastases, ALT and AST must still be =< 3 x ULN. Patients with liver metastases and AST/ALT above this limit will not be enrolled (obtained within 14 days prior to treatment start)\n* Total serum bilirubin =< 1.5 x ULN (unless bilirubin rise is due to Gilbert?s syndrome or of non-hepatic origin); or total bilirubin (TBILI) =< 3.0 x ULN with direct bilirubin within normal range in patients with well documented Gilbert?s syndrome (obtained within 14 days prior to treatment start)\n* Ability to swallow and retain oral medication (without crushing, dissolving or chewing tablets).\n* Phase Ib only: Prior enzalutamide treatment and/or other approved treatments for CRPC are acceptable\n* Phase II only: Participants MUST be treatment naive in the CRPC setting: i.e., no prior exposure to abiraterone acetate other specific CYP-17 inhibitors; no prior exposure to enzalutamide or investigational androgen receptor (AR) targeted agents; and no prior exposure to chemotherapy and or RAD-223.\n* Sexually active males must agree to use a condom during intercourse while taking the study drug and for at least 3 months after stopping study treatment. Sexually active males should not father a child during this period. A condom is required to be used by vasectomized men in order to prevent delivery of the drug via seminal fluid. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.\n* Participant or legal representative must understand the investigational nature of this study and voluntarily sign and date an Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board approved written informed consent form prior to receiving any study related procedure.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be MALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
