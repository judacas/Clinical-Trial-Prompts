    "official_title": "A Phase 1/2a Study of STM-416 Administered Intraoperatively to Patients Undergoing Transurethral Resection of Bladder Tumor (TURBT) for Recurrent High-Grade Papillary Bladder Cancer",
    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Are aged 18 years or older;\n2. Have a history of pathologically confirmed high-grade Ta or T1 NMIBC without CIS who have completed SOC previously, with recurrent papillary disease seen on cystoscopy, and who are undergoing TURBT without perioperative intravesical chemotherapy;\n3. Are considered high risk for recurrence;\n4. Have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0, 1, or 2;\n5. Have adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:\n\n   * Hemoglobin 9.0 g/dL;\n   * Absolute neutrophil count 1.5 × 109/L (1500 per mm3);\n   * Platelet count 75 × 109/L (75,000 per mm3);\n   * Serum bilirubin 1.5 × institutional upper limit of normal (ULN);\n   * AST (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase)/ALT (serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase) 2.5 × institutional ULN; and\n   * Creatinine CL 60 mL/min by the Cockcroft-Gault formula or by 24-hour urine collection for determination of creatinine CL: Males: Creatinine CL (mL/min) = Weight (kg) × (140 - Age)/72 × serum creatinine (mg/dL); or Females: Creatinine CL (mL/min) = Weight (kg) × (140 - Age) × 0.85/72 × serum creatinine (mg/dL).\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Have a history of CIS or MIBC;\n2. Are receiving any other investigational agents;\n3. Have a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to resiquimod (R848), or excipients used in STM-416 including poloxamer 407 and sodium hyaluronate;\n4. Have an uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n\n   Urinary tract infections are not exclusionary unless they are NCI-CTCAE Grade 3 or higher;\n5. Are a woman of childbearing potential regardless of contraceptive use; Note: Women of childbearing potential are only to be excluded in Phase 1 and Phase 2a to avoid bias due to the low prevalence of NMIBC in this population. However, they will be included in subsequent Phase 2/3 studies.",
