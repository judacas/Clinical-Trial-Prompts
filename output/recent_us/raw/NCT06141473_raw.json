    "inclusion_criteria": "* Age ≥ 18 years\n* Confirmation of invasive breast cancer including any of the following:\n\n  * Triple-negative breast cancer defined as receptor status being estrogen receptor expression ≤ 10%, progesterone receptor expression ≤ 10%, and HER2/Neu expression by IHC 0 or 1+, or 2+ with fluorescence in situ hybridization confirming no amplification of HER2 on a pretreatment tumor sample.\n  * Hormone positive breast cancer defined as receptor status being estrogen receptor expression > 10%, progesterone receptor expression > 10% prior to initiation of chemotherapy.\n  * HER2+ breast cancer defined as HER2/Neu expression by IHC 3+ or fluorescence in situ hybridization confirming amplification of HER2 on a pretreatment tumor sample prior to initiation of chemotherapy.
