    "official_title": "P53MVA and Pembrolizumab in Treating Patients With Recurrent Ovarian, Primary Peritoneal, or Fallopian Tube Cancer",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Participants with histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer will be enrolled in this study; patients must have experienced recurrence or progression within 6 months after completion of platinum based chemotherapy (by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] 1.1 criteria).\n* A patient is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant, not breast-feeding, and at least one of the following conditions applies: a.) Not a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) OR b.) A WOCBP who agrees to follow the contraceptive guidance during the treatment period and for at least 30 days after the last dose of study treatment\n* The participant (or legally acceptable representative if applicable) provides written informed consent for the trial\n* Have measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1., or detectable disease; lesions situated in a previously irradiated area are considered measurable if progression has been demonstrated in such lesions\n* Measurable disease is defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest dimension to be recorded); each lesion must be greater than or equal to 10 mm when measured by computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET)/CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); lymph nodes must be greater than or equal to 15 mm in short axis when measured by CT, PET/CT, or MRI\n\n  * Detectable disease in a patients is defined as one who does not have measurable disease, but has at least one of the following conditions:\n\n    * Baseline values of CA-125 at least 2 x upper limit of normal (ULN)\n    * Ascites and/ or pleural effusion attributed to tumor\n    * Solid and/ or cystic abnormalities on radiographic imaging that do not meet modified RECIST criteria, immune-related response criteria (irRC) for target lesions\n* Patients whose ovarian cancer recurs/progresses within 0-6 months following platinum-based chemotherapy have platinum resistant or refractory disease; these patients are not considered to benefit from additional platinum-based therapy and are treated with other sequential single agents; such patients are eligible for this trial\n* Patients with documented disease recurrence/progression within 6-12 months of completing platinum-based therapy, are considered to have 'borderline' platinum sensitivity; these patients will not be eligible for this trial\n* Patients who relapse more than 12 months after completion of platinum-based treatment are considered 'platinum sensitive' and will not be eligible for this trial, since they have a favorable (33-59%) chance of responding to further rounds of platinum based chemotherapy\n* Patients with confirmed p53 mutation by molecular analysis and/or evidence of p53 overexpression by immunohistochemistry (>= 10% of cells within tumor staining positive) will be eligible; this will be assessed semi-quantitatively by a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA) approved pathology core pathologist, using CLIA approved mutational analysis or immuno-histochemistry techniques on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue; in the case of equivocal immunohistochemistry (IHC) results, p53 involvement may be confirmed by detection of p53 molecular analysis on tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA); patients on whom molecular analysis of p53 mutations is already available, will not require IHC analysis; molecular analysis may be performed as an additional research procedure at the end of the study (distinct from eligibility determination) if the principal investigator (PI) deems it of scientific value and research funding is available to cover the cost; patients are not required to have PD-L1 positive ovarian tumors and PD-L1 testing is not mandatory on this study; however, we will collect the data on PD-L1 testing when available\n* Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of =< 2 (Karnofsky >= 60%) and a life expectancy of at least 3 months\n* Up to 4 prior chemotherapy regimens for recurrent disease are allowed; adjuvant chemotherapy and maintenance Taxol after completion of six cycles of adjuvant carboplatin - Taxol will not be counted as a \"prior chemotherapy regimen\" for the purpose of this study; treatment with targeted agents or hormones would not be considered as a systemic chemotherapy regimen;
