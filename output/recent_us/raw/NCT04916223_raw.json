Contraindications to any of the FFX treatment as follows:\n\nFolinic Acid\n\n* Calcium Folinate is contraindicated in patients who have previously shown hypersensitivity to folinate or any of the excipients.\n* Calcium Folinate Injection is contraindicated in the treatment of pernicious anemia or other megaloblastic anemias where vitamin B12 is deficient. Its use can lead to an apparent response of the hematopoietic system, but neurological damage may occur or progress if already present.\n* Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take calcium folinate tablets.\n\nFluorouracil/5FU\n\n* Fluorouracil is contraindicated in patients who have any known hypersensitivity to fluorouracil, are seriously debilitated or are suffering from bone marrow depression after radiotherapy or treatment with other antineoplastic agents, or who are suffering from a potentially serious infection.\n* Fluorouracil is strictly contraindicated in pregnant or breast-feeding women.\n* Flourouracil should not be used in the management of non-malignant disease.\n* Fluorouracil must not be taken or used concomitantly with brivudin, sorivudine and analogues. Brivudin, sorivudine and analogues are potent inhibitors of the enzyme dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) which degrades fluorouracil\n* In patients with known complete absence of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) activity\n\nOxaliplatin\n\n* Oxaliplatin is contraindicated in patients who have a known history of hypersensitivity to oxaliplatin or to any of the excipients\n* are breast-feeding.\n* have myelosuppression prior to starting first course, as evidenced by baseline neutrophils <2x109/l and/or platelet count of <100x109l.\n* have a peripheral sensitive neuropathy with functional impairment prior to first course.\n* have a severely impaired renal function (creatinine clearance less than 30 ml /min)\n\nIrinotecan\n\n* Chronic inflammatory bowel disease and/or bowel obstruction\n* History of severe hypersensitivity reactions to Irinotecan hydrochloride trihydrate or to any of the excipients\n* Bilirubin > 3 times the ULN\n* Severe bone marrow failure.\n* WHO performance status > 2.\n* Concomitant use with St John's wort",
