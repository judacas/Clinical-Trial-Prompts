Tumor tissue for retrospective central pathology review must be provided as an adjunct to participation in this study.\n5. Patients must have:\n\n   * relapsed and/or refractory disease\n   * at least one bidimensionally measurable, PET positive disease site (transverse diameter of ≥1.5 cm and perpendicular diameter of ≥1.0 cm at baseline)\n   * received at least one, but no more than three previous systemic regimens for the treatment of DLBCL and one therapy line must have included a CD20-targeted therapy\n   * Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 0 to 2\n6. Patients not considered in the opinion of the investigator eligible to undergo intensive salvage therapy including ASCT\n7. Patients must meet the following laboratory criteria at screening:\n\n   * absolute neutrophil count ≥1.5 × 10^9/L\n   * platelet count ≥90 × 10^9/L\n   * total serum bilirubin ≤2.5 × ULN or ≤5 × ULN in cases of Glibert's Syndrome or liver involvement by lymphoma\n   * alanine transaminase, aspartate aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase ≤3 × ULN or <5 × ULN in cases of liver involvement\n   * serum creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/minute\n8. Patients who received previous CD19 targeted therapy (other than tafasitamab) must have CD19 positive lymphoma confirmed on a biopsy taken since completing the prior CD19 targeted therapy\n9. Patients with primary refractory disease who received at least one, but no more than three previous systemic regimens (including a CD20 targeted therapy)\n\nMajor\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 99 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Patients who are legally institutionalized or concurrent enrollment in another interventional clinical study\n2. Patients who have:\n\n   * other histological type of lymphoma\n   * a history of \"double/triple hit\" genetics\n3. Patients who have, within 14 days prior to Day 1 dosing:\n\n   * not discontinued CD20-targeted therapy, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, investigational anticancer therapy or other lymphoma specific therapy\n   * undergone major surgery (with 4 weeks) or suffered from significant traumatic injury\n   * received live vaccines (within 4 weeks).\n   * required parenteral antimicrobial therapy for active, intercurrent infections\n4. Patients who:\n\n   * have not recovered sufficiently from the adverse toxic effects of prior therapies\n   * were previously treated with IMiDs® (e.g. thalidomide, LEN)\n   * have history of hyper sensitivity to compounds of similar biological or chemical composition to tafasitamab IMiDs® and/or the excipients contained in the study treatment formulations\n   * have undergone ASCT within the period ≤ 3 months prior to signing the informed consent form.\n   * have undergone previous allogenic stem cell transplantation\n   * have a history of deep venous thrombosis/embolism and who are not willing/able to take venous thromboembolic event prophylaxis during the entire treatment period\n   * concurrently use other anticancer or experimental treatments\n5. History of other malignancy that could affect compliance with the protocol or interpretation of results. Exceptions\n\n   * Patients with any malignancy appropriately treated with curative intent and the malignancy has been in remission without treatment for >2 years prior to enrollment are eligible\n   * Patients with low-grade, early-stage prostate cancer (Gleason score 6 or below, Stage 1 or 2) with no requirement for therapy at any time prior to study are eligible\n6. Patients with:\n\n   * positive hepatitis B and/or C serology.\n   * known seropositivity for or history of active viral infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\n   * CNS lymphoma involvement\n   * history or evidence of clinically significant cardiovascular, CNS and/or other systemic disease that would in the investigator's opinion preclude participation in the study or compromise the patient's ability to give informed consent\n   * history or evidence of rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption\n   * gastrointestinal (GI) abnormalities (issue with absorption) including the inability to take oral medication\n   * history or evidence of severe hepatic impairment (total serum bilirubin > 3mg/dL), jaundice unless secondary to Gilbert's syndrome or documented liver involvement by lymphoma\n   * history of hypersensitivity to any of the study treatments or its excipients or to drugs of similar chemical class\n   * any other medical condition which, in the investigator's opinion, makes the patient unsuitable for the study\n7. Female participants: Agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive methods and refrain from breast feeding and donating eggs; agreement to ongoing pregnancy testing during the course of the study, and after study therapy has ended Male participants: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use a condom and agreement to refrain from donating sperm",
