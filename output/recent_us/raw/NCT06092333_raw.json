    "official_title": "Intratumoral Gene Mediated Cytotoxic Immunotherapy (GMCI) For Resectable Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Pathologically documented non-small cell carcinoma (cytology or histology) that is accessible via standard-of-care staging procedures: (1) EBUS or (2) surgical approaches (eg mediastinoscopy, mediastinotomy or VATS).\n* Resectable with negative lymph nodes based on imaging with histologic confirmation at time of the staging procedure prior to AdV-tk injection\n* The tumor must be 4cm or greater in diameter based on imaging\n* ECOG Performance status of 0 or 1.\n* Granulocyte count (ANC) ≥ 1,000/mm3\n* Peripheral lymphocyte count ≥ 500/mm3\n* Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dl\n* Platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3\n* Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal\n* SGOT (AST) ≤ 3x upper limit of normal\n* Serum creatinine < 2mg/dl\n* Calculated creatinine clearance > 30ml/min\n* Patients must give study specific informed consent prior to enrollment\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Radiotherapy and/or treatment with chemotherapeutic, cytotoxic, or immunologic agents within 4 weeks prior to infusion of the vector.\n* Known immunodeficiency such as HIV infection\n* Active liver disease, including known cirrhosis or active hepatitis\n* Use of systemic corticosteroids (>10 mg prednisone per day or equivalent) or other systemic immunosuppressive drugs\n* Patient is pregnant or breast-feeding. Female patients of childbearing age must have negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 1 week of beginning therapy. Subjects must use acceptable means of birth control until 30 days after the vector injection.\n* Presence of any other life-threatening illness, such as unstable angina, severe oxygen dependence, significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), end-stage liver or renal disease. COPD will be considered significant if disease limits activities of daily living, results in the inability to walk up 1 flight of stair, or requires home oxygen.\n* Presence of known untreated brain metastases.\n* Prior bone marrow transplants (including stem cells) except autologous stem cell transplant without immunosuppression is NOT considered an exclusion.\n* Known sensitivity or allergic reactions to valacyclovir",
