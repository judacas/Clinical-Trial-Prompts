Tumor biopsies will be required for all subjects. Tumor lesions used for biopsy should not be lesions used as RECIST target lesions, unless there are no other lesions suitable for biopsy. If a RECIST target lesion is used for biopsy the lesion must be >= 2 cm in longest diameter.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 12 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Palliative surgery and/or radiation treatment within 28 days prior to date of randomization; also no steroids are permitted as of 28 days of starting the study.\n* Inability to give informed consent.\n* Exposure to any therapeutic agent (investigational or conventional) within 7 days of date of randomization or to any agent for which 5 half lives have not elapsed.\n* An inadequate tumor specimen as defined by the central pathologist.\n* History of other malignancies except cured basal cell carcinoma, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma in situ, superficial bladder cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix; for other malignancies, must be documented to be free of cancer for >= 2 years. All other cases can be considered on a case by case basis at the discretion of the principal investigator.\n* Current, serious, clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias or hypertension that is not adequately controlled, per investigator discretion.\n* Concomitant use of medications associated with a high incidence of QT prolongation will require clearance by medical monitor.\n* Active, clinically significant serious infection requiring treatment with antibiotics, anti-virals or anti-fungals. The Medical Monitor should be contacted for any uncertainties.\n* Any condition that might interfere with the subject?s participation in the study, safety, or in the evaluation of the study results.\n* Concurrent enrollment in another clinical study, unless it is an observational (non-interventional) clinical study or the follow-up period of an interventional study.\n* Prior exposure to any anti-LAG3 antibodies. (prior PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies are permitted).\n* Any concurrent chemotherapy, immunotherapy, biologic or hormonal therapy for cancer treatment.

Subjects with TnT or TnI levels between > 1 to 2 x ULN will be permitted if repeat levels within 24 hours are 1 x ULN. If TnT or TnI levels are > 1 to 2 x ULN within 24 hours, the subject may undergo a cardiac evaluation and be considered for treatment, following a discussion with the BMS medical monitor or designee. When repeat levels within 24 hours are not available, a repeat test should be conducted as soon as possible. If TnT or TnI repeat levels beyond 24 hours are < 2 x ULN, the subject may undergo a cardiac evaluation and be considered for treatment, following a discussion with the BMS Medical Monitor or designee.",
