Imaging studies must include a diagnostic CT scan of the involved disease sites and all known sites of resected disease and brain magnetic resonance (MRI) or CT (brain CT allowable if MRI is contraindicated or if there is no known history of resected brain lesions).\n* Tumor tissue from the core biopsy or resected site of disease must be provided for biomarker analyses.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
