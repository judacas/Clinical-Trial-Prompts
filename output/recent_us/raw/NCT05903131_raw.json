    "inclusion_criteria": "* Patient must have histologically or cytologically documented evidence of prostate adenocarcinoma\n* Patient must previously have undergone radical prostatectomy\n* Patient must previously have undergone either adjuvant or salvage radiation therapy to the prostatic fossa +/- whole pelvis\n* Patient must have a prostate specific antigen (PSA) >= 0.2 and < 10 ng/mL. If there is only one PSA value that has risen to >= 0.2 with this biochemical recurrence, a second PSA value must be confirmed to be within >= 0.2 and < 10 ng/mL at least 2 weeks from the first value and within 28 days of enrollment\n* PSA doubling time must be calculated utilizing either all PSA measurements > 0.1 ng/mL from most recent biochemically-recurred (BCR) or the most recent 3 PSA measurements > 0.1 ng/mL (if the latter, all 3 PSA measurements must be > 2 weeks apart to be used in the calculation). PSA doubling time must be > 3 months and < 18 months. The Memorial Sloan Kettering PSA doubling time calculator should be used\n* Patient must have no previous evidence of radiographically detectable metastatic prostate cancer by conventional CT and bone scan imaging\n* Patient must have total testosterone level > 120 ng/dL demonstrated within 42 days of enrollment\n* Patient must have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1\n* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >= 1.0 X 10^9/L\n* Platelet count >= 100 X 10^9/L\n* Hemoglobin >= 9 g/dL\n* Potassium >= 3.5\n* Serum bilirubin =< 1.5 X upper limit of normal (ULN) or =< 3 X ULN for patients with documented Gilbert's syndrome\n* Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) =< 3 X ULN\n* Creatinine clearance (Cr Cl) >= 30 mL/min as estimated by the Cockcroft-Gault criteria or as determined by 24 hour Cr Cl measurement\n* Patient must be >= 18 years of age on day of signing informed consent\n* Patient must be able to understand and authorize informed consent\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be MALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Chronic active hepatitis B or C\n* History of a second, non-prostate malignancy that required systemic therapy in the last 2 years except cancer in situ of bladder and non-melanomatous cancers of the skin\n* Patient with a serious underlying medical condition that would otherwise impair the patient's ability to undergo fluciclovine or PSMA PET/CT imaging or receive subsequent treatment\n* Any condition that would alter the patient's mental status, prohibiting understanding and/or authorization of informed consent\n* Expected lifespan of less than 12 weeks\n* Inability to lay still for imaging\n* Weight > 300 lbs. (due to equipment specifications)\n* Any other underlying medical condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would impair the ability of the patient to receive or tolerate the planned treatment and/or follow up",
