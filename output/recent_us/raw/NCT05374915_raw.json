    "official_title": "An Open-Labeled, Single Arm Phase 2 Efficacy and Safety Study of REM-001 Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) for Treatment of Cutaneous Metastatic Breast Cancer (CMBC) That is Refractory or Not Eligible for Radiotherapy or Surgery",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Adult participants 18 years of age or greater.\n* Participants able and willing to sign informed consent.\n* Histopathologically confirmed breast cancer metastasis to the skin.\n* Cutaneous metastasis not suitable for surgical resection.\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 to 2.\n* Symptomatic lesions (including discomfort, pain, discharge, ulceration).\n* Cutaneous, subcutaneous soft tissue, or superficial lymphatic metastasis that is amenable to PDT:\n\n  * Lesion(s) > 10 mm and < 60 mm in longest dimension.\n  * Lesion(s) exhibit at least one of the following symptoms: ulcerated, bleeding, discharging, itchy, painful.\n  * Judged by investigator as eligible for PDT.\n* Participants are radiotherapy refractory (have received a radiation dose of 60 gray (Gy) or greater to the ipsilateral thorax) or are not otherwise amenable to radiotherapy.\n* Disease progression on at least 2 courses of systemic therapy:\n\n  * HR positive/HER2 negative participants: should be refractory to endocrine therapy (at least 2 different regimens including at least one CDK4/6 inhibitor). Maintenance endocrine therapy at the clinician's discretion is allowed.\n  * HER2 positive participants should have had disease progression on at least 2 different regimens of HER2 targeted therapies. Maintenance therapy on trastuzumab (HERCEPTIN®) is allowed.\n* If participants are on systemic therapy at enrollment, they must meet the following:\n\n  * Participants must have undergone a minimum of two cycles of systemic therapy prior to enrollment.\n  * The systemic therapy must be one from the Treatment of Physician's Choice (TPC) list, as follows: : eribulin mesylate (Halaven®); capecitabine (Xeloda®); Gemcitabine (Gemzar®); a taxane [either docetaxel (Taxotere®), nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane®), or paclitaxel (Taxol®)]; vinorelbine (Navelbine®); an antibody-drug conjugate [either sacituzumab-govitecan (Trodelvy®), trastuzumab-deruxtecan (Enhertu®), or ado-trastuzumab emtansine (KADCYLA®)]; pembrolizumab (Keytruda®); or carboplatin (Paraplatin®).\n  * Patients who are not on any chemotherapy will also be eligible.\n* At the time of enrolment, participants should have no known plans to change or modify their TPC regimen while receiving study treatment. Note: TPC regimen may be changed or modified after treatment with REM-001 therapy, but this should be done in consultation with the Sponsor Medical Monitor.\n* Adequate renal function, as evidenced by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) > 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 using the CKD-EPI Creatinine Equation without race.\n* Adequate bone marrow function as evidenced by absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 × 10^9/L, hemoglobin ≥ 8.5 g/dL and platelet count ≥ 100 × 10^9/L; INR < 1.5.\n* Adequate liver function as evidenced by bilirubin ≤ 2.0 times the upper limits of normal (ULN) and alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 3 × ULN (in the case of liver metastases ≤ 5 × ULN) [Participants with known Gilbert's Syndrome who have serum bilirubin < 1.5 x ULN (NCI CTCAE v5.0 Gr 2) may be enrolled].\n* QTCF < 470msec on baseline ECG\n* Woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum pregnancy test documented within 7 days prior to registration and must agree to practice adequate contraception\n* Male patients must be sterile or willing to use an approved method of contraception from the time of treatment with REM-001 until 90 days after study drug treatment.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Participants who have received local cryotherapy, radiotherapy, intra-lesional chemotherapy, systemic or topical PDT, or surgery to study lesion fields within the past 12 weeks.\n* Participants with progressive brain or subdural metastases, or leptomeningeal disease.\n* Participants with previously treated brain or subdural metastases may participate provided:\n\n  * Previously treated brain metastases are stable and without evidence of progression, as determined by contrast-enhanced CT or MRI brain scan, for at least 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment.\n  * There is no evidence of new brain metastases\n  * They have completed local therapy and discontinued the use of corticosteroids for this indication for at least 4 weeks prior to first dose of study treatment.\n  * Any neurologic symptoms attributed to brain metastases must have been stable for at least 4 weeks prior to study enrollment\n* History of allergic or hypersensitivity reactions to light, egg proteins or egg yolk; history of porphyria, systemic lupus erythematosus, or xeroderma pigmentosum.\n* Known disorder of lipoprotein metabolism or clearance (cholesterol> 400 mg/dl, and/or triglycerides > 500 mg/dl).\n* Participants who have received investigational agents within the past 4 weeks or within 4 half-lives of the investigational agent (whichever is shorter) before the first study drug dose.\n* Participants with inflammatory breast cancer.\n* Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection with detectable virus titer.\n* Active or chronic hepatitis B or C infection.\n* Active or ongoing infection requiring systemic treatment.\n* Participants who have undergone major surgery within 4 weeks of study treatment, or have planned surgery within 4 weeks of anticipated initiation of treatment with REM-001 therapy.\n* Participants with otherwise unexplained weight loss (> 10% body weight) in the last 30 days prior to Screening.\n* History of other malignancy treated with curative intent within the last 3-5 years. Exceptions are: Curatively treated basal cell/squamous cell skin cancer; carcinoma in situ of the cervix; superficial transitional cell bladder carcinoma\n* Patients with other major or uncontrolled medical conditions, e.g., myocardial infarction or New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III/IV heart failure within the last 6 months, stroke, uncontrolled diabetes, uncontrolled autoimmune disease.\n* WOCBP that is pregnant or breast-feeding, or planning to become pregnant or breast-feed during protocol treatment and for 3 months after last dose of REM-001 therapy.\n* WOCBP unwilling to use effective contraception during protocol treatment and for 3 months after last dose of REM-001 therapy.",
