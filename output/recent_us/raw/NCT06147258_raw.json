Dose Escalation Phase (Part 1):\n\n   Escalation Cohort B combination with trametinib and Cohort C combination with binimetinib closed on January 8, 2024.\n   1. Participants must have a pathologically confirmed diagnosis of an advanced or metastatic solid tumor with a documented RAS, NF1, or RAF mutations. A molecular pathology report documenting mutational status of RAS, NF1, or RAF must be available.\n   2. Progressed despite standard therapies, and received at least 1 prior line of anticancer therapy.\n\n      * Participants with a documented mutation in BRAF V600E or V600K must have received approved treatments known to provide clinical benefit prior to study entry.\n   3. Participants enrolled in the DCC-3116 and sotorasib cohort (Cohort D) must have a KRAS G12C mutation.\n3. Dose Expansion Phase (Part 2):\n\n   Expansion Cohorts 1, 2, 3 and 4 combinations will not open for enrollment.\n\n   Cohort 5: Patients with KRAS G12C mutant NSCLC\n   * Pathologically confirmed NSCLC with a documented mutation in KRAS G12C.\n   * Received at least 1 prior line of systemic therapy in the advanced or metastatic setting.\n   * Have not received prior sotorasib or other KRAS G12C inhibitor therapy.\n4. Must provide a fresh tumor biopsy from a primary or metastatic cancer lesion if it can be biopsied with acceptable risk as determined by the Investigator.\n5.

    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Must not have received the following within the specified time periods prior to the first dose of study drug:\n\n   1. Prior therapies (anticancer or therapies given for other reasons) that are known strong or moderate inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 or P-glycoprotein (P-gp) including certain herbal medications (e.g., St. John's Wort): 14 days or 5× the half-life of the medication (whichever is longer)\n   2. All other prior anticancer therapies or any therapy that is investigational for the participant's condition with a known safety and PK profile: 14 days or 5× the half-life of the medication (whichever is shorter)\n   3. Investigational therapies with unknown safety and PK profile: 28 days. If there is enough data on the investigational therapy to assess the risk for drug-drug interactions and late toxicities of prior therapy as low, the Sponsor's Medical Monitor may approve a shorter washout of 14 days\n   4. Grapefruit or grapefruit juice: 14 days\n2. Has a prior or concurrent malignancy that requires treatment or is expected to require treatment for active cancer during this study . Hormonal maintenance after treatment is allowed.\n3. Have not recovered from all toxicities from prior therapy according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE).\n4. Presence or history of central nervous system (CNS) metastases or leptomeningeal disease, with some exceptions\n5. New York Heart Association Class III or IV heart disease, active ischemia, or any other uncontrolled cardiac condition such as angina pectoris, clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia requiring therapy, uncontrolled hypertension, congestive heart failure, or myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to the first dose of study drug.\n6. Prolongation of the QT interval corrected by Fridericia's formula (QTcF) based on repeated demonstration of QTcF >450 ms in males or >470 ms in females at screening, or history of long QT syndrome.\n7. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <50% at Screening\n8. Systemic arterial thrombotic or embolic events within 6 months prior to the first dose of study drug\n9. Systemic venous thrombotic events within 1 month prior to the first dose of study drug\n10. Malabsorption syndrome\n11. Major surgery within 4 weeks of the first dose of study drug. All surgical wounds must be healed and free of infection or dehiscence before the first dose of the study drug.\n12. Any other clinically significant comorbidities.\n13. For participants receiving DCC-3116 and trametinib combination or DCC-3116 and binimetinib combination: previous treatment with trametinib or binimetinib that resulted in treatment discontinuation due to intolerability as a result of an adverse event (AE) that was considered related to trametinib or binimetinib.\n14. For participants receiving DCC-3116 and sotorasib combination in Dose Escalation Part 1: previous treatment with sotorasib that resulted in treatment discontinuation due to intolerability as a result of an adverse event (AE) that was considered related to sotorasib.\n15. For participants receiving DCC-3116 and sotorasib combination: Use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and H2 receptor antagonists that cannot be discontinued 3 days prior to the start of study drug administration.\n16. Known allergy or hypersensitivity to any component of the investigational drug products.\n17. Known human immunodeficiency virus unless the following requirements are met:\n\n    1. CD4 count >350/µL\n    2. No AIDS-defining opportunistic infection in the last 12 months\n    3.
