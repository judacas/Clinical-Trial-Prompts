    "official_title": "A PHASE 4, OPEN-LABEL, RANDOMIZED STUDY OF TWO INOTUZUMAB OZOGAMICIN DOSE LEVELS IN ADULT PATIENTS WITH RELAPSED OR REFRACTORY B-CELL ACUTE LYMPHOBLASTIC LEUKEMIA ELIGIBLE FOR HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION AND WHO HAVE RISK FACTOR(S) FOR VENO-OCCLUSIVE DISEASE",
    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Relapsed or refractory precursor CD22 positive B cell ALL with M2 or M3 marrow (≥5% blasts) and who are eligible for HSCT;\n2.

Ph+ ALL patients must have failed treatment with at least 1 second or third generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor and standard multi agent induction chemotherapy;\n4.

Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 2;\n8. Adequate liver function, including total serum bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN unless the patient has documented Gilbert syndrome, and aspartate and alanine aminotransferase (AST and ALT) ≤2.5 x ULN;\n9. Serum creatinine ≤1.5 x ULN or any serum creatinine level associated with a measured or calculated creatinine clearance of >=40 mL/min;\n10. Male and female patients of childbearing potential and at risk for pregnancy must agree to use a highly effective method of contraception throughout the study and for a minimum of 8 months (females) and 5 months (males) after the last dose of assigned treatment. A patient is of childbearing potential if, in the opinion of the Investigator, he/she is biologically capable of having children and is sexually active. Female subjects of nonchildbearing potential must meet at least 1 of the following criteria:\n\n    1. Achieved postmenopausal status, defined as follows: cessation of regular menses for at least 12 consecutive months with no alternative pathological or physiological cause; and have a serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level confirming the postmenopausal state;\n    2. Have undergone a documented hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy;\n    3. Have medically confirmed ovarian failure. All other female subjects (including female subjects with tubal ligations) are considered to be of childbearing potential.\n11. Evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent document indicating that the subject has been informed of all pertinent aspects of the study; patients with mental capacity which requires the presence of a legally authorized representative will be excluded from the study;\n12. Willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan, laboratory tests, and other study procedures.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 75 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Isolated extramedullary relapse (ie, testicular or central nervous system);\n2. Burkitt's or mixed phenotype acute leukemia based on the WHO 2008 criteria;\n3. Active central nervous system (CNS) leukemia, as defined by unequivocal morphologic evidence of lymphoblasts in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), use of CNS directed local treatment for active disease within the prior 28 days, symptomatic CNS leukemia (ie, cranial nerve palsies or other significant neurologic dysfunction) within 28 days. Prophylactic intrathecal medication is not a reason for exclusion;\n4. Prior chemotherapy within 2 weeks before randomization with the following exceptions:\n\n   1. To reduce the circulating lymphoblast count or palliation: ie, steroids, hydroxyurea or vincristine;\n   2. For ALL maintenance: mercaptopurine, methotrexate, vincristine, thioguanine, and/or tyrosine kinase inhibitors.\n\n   Patients must have recovered from acute non hematologic toxicity (to Grade 1 or less) of all previous therapy prior to enrollment.\n5. Prior monoclonal antibodies within 6 weeks of randomization, with the exception of rituximab which must be discontinued at least 2 weeks prior to randomization;\n6. Prior inotuzumab ozogamicin treatment or other anti CD22 immunotherapy within 6 months before randomization;\n7. Prior allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) within 90 days before randomization. Patients must have completed immunosuppression therapy for treatment of graft versus host disease (GvHD) prior to enrollment. At randomization, patients must not have Grade 2 or higher acute GvHD, or extensive chronic GvHD;\n8. Peripheral absolute lymphoblast count >=10,000 /L (treatment with hydroxyurea and/or steroids/vincristine is permitted within 2 weeks of randomization to reduce the white blood cell [WBC] count);\n9. Known systemic vasculitides (eg, Wegener's granulomatosis, polyarteritis nodosa, systemic lupus erythematosus), primary or secondary immunodeficiency (such as human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection or severe inflammatory disease);\n10. Active hepatitis B infection as evidenced by hepatitis B surface antigen, active hepatitis C infection (must be anti-hepatitis C antibody negative or hepatitis C ribonucleic acid negative), or known seropositivity for HIV. HIV testing may need to be performed in accordance with local regulations or local practice;\n11. Major surgery within 4 weeks before randomization;\n12. Unstable or severe uncontrolled medical condition (eg, unstable cardiac function or unstable pulmonary condition);\n13. Concurrent active malignancy other than non-melanoma skin cancer, carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or localized prostate cancer that has been definitely treated with radiation or surgery. Patients with previous malignancies are eligible provided that they have been disease free for >=2 years;\n14. Patients with active heart disease or the presence of New York Heart Association (NYHA) stage III or IV congestive heart failure;\n15. QTcF >470 msec (based on the average of 3 consecutive electrocardiogram [ECGs]);\n16. Myocardial infarction within 6 months before randomization;\n17. History of clinically significant ventricular arrhythmia, or unexplained syncope not believed to be vasovagal in nature, or chronic bradycardic states such as sinoatrial block or higher degrees of atrioventricular (AV) block unless a permanent pacemaker has been implanted;\n18. Uncontrolled electrolyte disorders that can compound the effects of a QTc prolonging drug (eg, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia);\n19. Prior confirmed or ongoing hepatic veno occlusive disease (VOD) or sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS), or other serious or current ongoing liver disease such as cirrhosis or nodular regenerative hyperplasia;\n20. Administration of live vaccine within 6 weeks before randomization;\n21. Evidence of uncontrolled current serious active infection (including sepsis, bacteremia, fungemia) or patients with a recent history (within 4 months) of deep tissue infections such as fascitis or osteomyelitis;\n22. Patients who have had a severe allergic reaction or anaphylactic reaction to any humanized monoclonal antibodies;\n23. Pregnant female subjects; breastfeeding female subjects; fertile male subjects and female subjects of childbearing potential who are unwilling or unable to use highly effective contraception as outlined in this protocol for the duration of the study and for a minimum of 8 months (females) and 5 months (males) after the last dose of investigational product;\n24. Investigative site staff members directly involved in the conduct of the study and their family members, site staff members otherwise supervised by the Investigator, or subjects who are Pfizer employees, including their family members, directly involved in the conduct of the study;\n25. Participation in other studies involving investigational drug(s) within 2 weeks prior to study entry and/or during study participation (up through the end of treatment visit);\n26. Other acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition including recent (within the past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the Investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this study.",
