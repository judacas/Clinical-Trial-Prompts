    "official_title": "A Phase 3, Randomized, Open-label, Multi-center Study Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of TAR-200 Versus Investigator's Choice of Intravesical Chemotherapy in Participants Who Received Bacillus Calmette-GuÃ©rin (BCG) and Recurred With High-risk Non-muscle-invasive Bladder Cancer (HR-NMIBC) and Who Are Ineligible for or Elected Not to Undergo Radical Cystectomy",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Histologically confirmed diagnosis by local pathology (within 90 days of documented informed consent) of recurrent, papillary-only high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (HR-NMIBC) [defined as high-grade Ta or any T1, no carcinoma in situ (CIS)]\n* Participants with variant histologic subtypes are allowed if tumor(s) demonstrate urothelial (transitional cell histology) predominance. However, neuroendocrine, and small cell variants will be excluded\n* Participants must be ineligible for or have elected not to undergo Radical Cystectomy (RC)\n* Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status Grade of 0, 1, or 2\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Presence of CIS at any point from time of diagnosis of papillary-only HR-NMIBC recurrence to randomization. Additionally, presence or history of histologically confirmed, muscle-invasive, locally advanced, nonresectable, or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (that is, T2, T3, T4, N+, and/or M+)\n* Presence of any bladder or urethral anatomic feature that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may prevent the safe placement, indwelling use, or removal of TAR-200. Participants with tumors involving the prostatic urethra in men will be excluded\n* A history of clinically significant polyuria with recorded 24-hour urine volumes greater than 4000 milliliters (>4000 mL)\n* Indwelling catheters are not permitted; however, intermittent catheterization is acceptable\n* Previous treatment with TAR-200",
