If the initial QTcF is found to be > 480 msec, two additional electrocardiograms (EKGs) separated by at least 3 minutes should be performed. If the average of these three consecutive results for QTcF is ≤ 480 msec, the subject meets eligibility in this regard. Subjects with history of congenital long QT syndrome, or torsades de pointes, are not allowed.\n* Pregnant or lactating females.\n* Inability to swallow tablets or capsules.\n* Previously identified allergy or hypersensitivity to components of the study treatment formulations.\n* Malignancies other than RCC within 5 years of first study treatment with the exception of those with negligible risk of metastases or death (carcinoma in situ of the cervix, basal or squamous cell skin cancer, localized prostate cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast, non-muscle invasive urothelial carcinoma).\n* Any serious medical or psychiatric illness that could, in the site investigator's opinion, potentially interfere with the completion of treatment according to this protocol.\n* Daily or chronic use of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and/or having taken a PPI within 7 days before receiving the first dose of study drug.",
