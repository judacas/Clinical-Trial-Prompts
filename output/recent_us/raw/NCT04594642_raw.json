Prior systemic therapy for unresectable, locally advanced recurrent or metastatic ESCC\n3. Received prior therapies targeting programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1), programmed cell death protein ligand-1 (PD-L1) or PD-L2\n4. Participants with evidence of fistula (either esophageal/bronchial or esophageal/aorta)\n5. Uncontrollable pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, or ascites requiring frequent drainage or medical intervention (clinically significant recurrence requiring an additional intervention within 2 weeks of intervention)\n6. Evidence of complete esophageal obstruction not amenable to treatment\n7. Unintentional weight loss ≥ 5% within one month prior to randomization or Nutritional Risk Index (NRI) < 83.5 per investigator's choice\n8. Locally advanced esophageal carcinoma that is resectable or potentially curable with radiation therapy per local investigator.\n9. Participants with untreated chronic hepatitis B or chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers whose HBV DNA is ≥ 500 IU/mL or participants with active hepatitis C virus (HCV)\n\nNOTE: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.",
