    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Capable and willing to give signed informed consent which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the informed consent form (ICF).\n2. Participant must be at least 18 years of age, at the time of signing the ICF.\n3. Participants must have histological or cytological confirmation of advanced malignancy considered to be suitable for study treatment.\n4. Eastern cooperative oncology group performance status 0-1.\n5. Life expectancy greater than 12 weeks.\n6. Progressive cancer at the time of study entry.\n7. Pharmacodynamics expansion cohorts: Participants must have at least 1 tumour suitable for biopsy and consent to having biopsies collected.\n8. Negative pregnancy test (urine or serum) prior to start of dosing for women of childbearing potential.\n9. Female participants must be post-menopausal, surgically sterile, or using an acceptable method of contraception for the duration of the study (from the time they sign consent) and for 12 weeks after the last dose of study treatment to prevent pregnancy.\n10. For the duration of the study (from the time they sign consent) and for 12 weeks after the last dose of study treatment, sexually active male participants must be willing to use contraception.\n\nPost-menopausal is defined as:\n\n* No menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the post-menopausal range may be used to confirm a post-menopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy). However in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a FSH measurement is insufficient.\n* Radiation-induced oophorectomy with last menses greater than 12 months ago.\n* Chemotherapy-induced menopause with greater than 12 month interval since last menses.\n* Surgical sterilisation.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 130 Years",
