    "official_title": "A Phase Ib Trial of PBF-1129 and Nivolumab in Patients with Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Age >= 18 years\n* Confirmed recurrent or metastatic non-small cell carcinoma of the lung of any histology without curative options\n* Measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1\n* Patients must have received standard of care chemotherapy and immunotherapy. No limits to prior lines of therapy. Prior PD-1 and/or PD-L1 directed therapies are required. Prior CTLA4 therapy is permitted. Patients may have received no more than 3 prior lines of therapy in the metastatic setting (excluding targeted therapies)\n* Patients with known actionable mutations with Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatment options must have received all approved and standard of care treatment options (ie osimertinib for EGFR, alectinib for ALK, etc)\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1\n* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >= 1,500 /mcL\n* Platelets >= 100,000 / mcL\n* Serum creatinine OR measured or calculated creatinine clearance (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] can also be used in place of creatinine or creatinine clearance [CrCl]) =< 1.5 X upper limit of normal (ULN) OR >= 60 mL/min for subject with creatinine levels > 1.5 X institutional ULN\n* Serum total bilirubin =< 1.5 X ULN OR direct bilirubin =< ULN for subjects with total bilirubin levels > 1.5 ULN\n* AAspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT]) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT]) =< 3 X ULN OR =< 5 X ULN for subjects with liver metastases\n* Albumin >= 2.5 mg/dL\n* International normalized ratio (INR) or prothrombin time (PT) or activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) =< 1.5 X ULN unless subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants =< 1.5 X ULN unless subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants\n* Anticipated life expectancy of >= 3 months\n* Willing to comply with study procedures\n* Must be able to swallow pills\n* Female subjects of childbearing potential must be willing to use an adequate method of contraception\n* For female patients of childbearing potential, a negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to first dose of protocol therapy is required\n* Be willing and able to understand and sign the written informed consent document\n* Availability of a recent formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue block. A recently obtained archival FFPE tumor tissue block (if an FFPE tissue block cannot be provided, 15 unstained slides (10 minimum) will be acceptable) from a primary or metastatic tumor resection or biopsy can be provided if it was obtained within 1 year of trial screening. Patients with archival tissue that does not meet this criteria may still be eligible in the dose escalation cohort only upon approval from PI.\n* For patients in dose expansion cohort: Be willing to provide tissue from a pre-treatment and on-treatment fin needle aspirate (FNA) or core biopsy of a tumor lesion. Subjects must consent to pre-treatment and on-treatment biopsy prior to initiation of clinical trial, however subjects for whom newly-obtained samples cannot be provided (e.g. inaccessible or subject safety concern) may still continue on study\n* Be willing to provide peripheral blood samples for correlative studies\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Has active autoimmune disease, including myasthenic syndrome, which has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (eg, thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment\n* Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy (at a dose > 10 mg prednisone or equivalent) or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment\n* Known active chronic infections - human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), known active (ie with detectable polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) Hepatitis B or C\n* Cirrhosis (Child-Pugh B or worse) or cirrhosis with history of hepatic encephalopathy or clinically meaningful ascites resulting from cirrhosis. Clinically meaningful ascites is defined as ascites from cirrhosis requiring diuretics or paracentesis\n* Untreated central nervous system (CNS) metastases. Patients with treated brain metastases are eligible if they are clinically stable with regard to neurologic function, on stable dose of steroids after cranial irradiation with maximum of 10 mg prednisone equivalent. Treatment (whole brain radiation therapy, focal radiation therapy, and stereotactic radiosurgery) must be completed at least 2 weeks prior to study entry, or after surgical resection performed at least 28 days prior to treatment initiation\n* Pregnancy or breastfeeding\n* Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator\n* Any of the following cardiac criteria:\n\n  * Mean resting corrected QT interval (corrected QT [QTc] using Fredericia's formula [QTcF]) > 470 msec (Fridericia's Criteria for Corrected QT interval [QTc] Calculation: Fridericia's formula QTcF = (QT/RR0.33). RR is the time from the interval of 1 QRS complex to the next measured in seconds and is commonly calculated as (60/heart rate [HR])\n  * Any clinically important abnormalities in rhythm, conduction or morphology of resting electrocardiogram (ECG) (e.g., complete left bundle branch block, third degree heart block, second degree heart block\n* Any patient who experience unacceptable toxicity on prior checkpoint inhibitor therapy:\n\n  * >= grade 3 adverse event (AE) related to checkpoint inhibitor\n  * Ongoing >= grade 2 immune-related AE associated with checkpoint inhibitor with the exception of endocrine toxicities as detailed below\n  * CNS, ocular or cardiac AE of any grade related to checkpoint inhibitor\n  * NOTE: Patients with a prior endocrine AE are permitted to enroll if they are stably maintained on appropriate replacement therapy and are asymptomatic",
