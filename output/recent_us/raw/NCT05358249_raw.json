    "inclusion_criteria": "* Patient with histologically confirmed diagnosis of CEA+ adenocarcinoma and liver metastases. Patient must have either histologic confirmation of the liver metastases or histologic documentation of the primary tumor and definitive radiologic evidence of liver involvement. Measurable disease is required with lesions of > 1.0 cm by CT. Soluble CEA is not acceptable as the sole measure of disease. Limited extrahepatic disease is acceptable if confined to the lungs or peritoneal cavity.\n* Tumor must be CEA-expressing as demonstrated by elevated serum CEA levels (â‰¥10ng/ml) or immunohistochemistry on a biopsy specimen. Archived tissue is acceptable for determination of CEA expression.\n* Patient must be at least 18 years of age.\n* Patient able to understand and sign informed consent.\n* Patient with a life expectancy of greater than four months.\n* Patient failed at least one line of standard systemic chemotherapy and has unresectable disease.\n* Patient with performance status of 0 to 1 (ECOG).\n* Patient with adequate organ function as defined in protocol.\n* Acceptable hepatic vascular anatomy as determined by CT, MR, or conventional angiography. A nuclear medicine study will be performed to document the absence of a significant hepatic-pulmonary shunt (<20%).\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Female patients of childbearing age will be tested for pregnancy. Pregnant patients will be excluded from the study.
