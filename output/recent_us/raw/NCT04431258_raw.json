Subjects that received adjuvant chemotherapy following cystectomy with recurrence >12 months from completion of therapy are permitted\n4. Subjects may have radiographic evidence of N1 disease (Metastasis ≤2 cm in greatest dimension, in a single lymph node)\n5. Subjects must be age 18 years or older.\n6. Archival tumor tissue will be used for eligibility.\n7. Subjects must have an ECOG Performance Status score of 0 or 2\n8.

A female subject of childbearing potential is anyone born female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilization (e.g., hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, bilateral oophorectomy) or has not completed menopause. Menopause is defined clinically as 12 months of amenorrhea in a person over age 45 in the absence of other biological, physiological, or pharmacological causes. Female subjects of childbearing potential must meet the following conditions:\n\n   * Agree not to try to become pregnant during the study and for at least 6 months after the final dose of study drug.\n   * Must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity of 25 mIU/mL or equivalent units of beta human chorionic gonadotropin [β-hCG]) within 1 day prior to administration of study drug. Female subjects with false positive results and documented verification of negative pregnancy status are eligible for participation.\n   * If heterosexually active, must consistently use highly effective methods of birth control, with a failure rate of less than 1% (as described in Appendix L) starting at screening, throughout the study period, and for at least 6 months after the final dose of study drug.\n   * Female subjects must agree not to breastfeed or donate ova starting at screening and throughout the study period, and for at least 6 months after the final dose of study drug.\n10.
