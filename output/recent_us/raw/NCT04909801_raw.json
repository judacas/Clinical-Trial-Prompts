If imaging is suspicious or abnormal, a fine needle aspiration (FNA) or core biopsy of the questionable node(s) on imaging is required. Nodal status should be classified according to the following criteria:\n\n  * Nodal status - negative\n\n    * Imaging of the axilla is negative; OR\n    * Imaging of the axilla is suspicious or abnormal AND FNA or core biopsy is negative.\n  * Nodal status - positive\n\n    * FNA or core biopsy of node(s) is cytologically or histologically suspicious or positive\n* Breast imaging performed prior to study registration as follows:\n* Ipsilateral breast - within 12 weeks\n* Contralateral breast - within 24 weeks\n* Age ≥ 18 years\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1\n* Adequate bone marrow function as defined below:\n\n  * Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,500/mm3\n  * Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3\n  * Hemoglobin ≥ 10.0 g/dL\n* Adequate renal function as defined below:\n* Serum creatinine ≤ upper limit of normal (ULN) for the lab or a calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min\n* Adequate hepatic function as defined below:\n\n  * Total bilirubin ≤ ULN for the laboratory\n  * Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 1.5 x ULN for the laboratory\n  * Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 1.5 x ULN for the laboratory\n  * Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) ≤ 2.5 x ULN for the laboratory Note: If ALP is > 1.5 x ULN, imaging to rule out bone and liver metastasis is required.\n* Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) assessment (ie, 2-D echocardiogram or multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan) performed within 12 weeks prior to study registration indicates an LVEF ≥ 50% regardless of the cardiac imaging facility's lower limit of normal\n* Women who are not postmenopausal or have not undergone hysterectomy must have a documented negative serum pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to initiating study treatment.\n\nNote: Postmenopausal is defined as any of the following:\n\n* Age ≥ 60 years\n* Age < 60 years and amenorrheic for at least 1 year with follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and plasma estradiol levels in the postmenopausal range\n* Bilateral oophorectomy\n\n  * A female patient who is a woman of child-bearing potential (WCBP) and a male patient with a partner who is a WCBP must agree to use a medically accepted method for preventing pregnancy for the duration of immunotherapy and neoadjuvant chemotherapy and until after completion of breast surgery or, for patients who do not receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy, for a minimum of 6 months following the last dose of pembrolizumab or decitabine\n  * Ability to understand and willingness to sign the consent form\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
