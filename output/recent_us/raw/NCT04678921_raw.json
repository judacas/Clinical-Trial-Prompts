    "inclusion_criteria": "Must have a documented diagnosis of invasive cancer that has been treated with either single modality therapy or any combination of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy/drug therapy (e.g. cytotoxic therapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, hormonal therapy, etc.). Patients with a cancer history of only superficial skin cancers or in situ malignancy are not eligible.\n\n* May be either off all treatment OR actively receiving anticancer therapy in an adjuvant setting, maintenance setting, or for active cancer.\n\n  * Patients who currently undergoing anticancer therapy should not have any plans to change or adjust their treatment during the intervention period. This includes changing to another therapy or ending therapy entirely.\n  * Patients who are currently receiving anticancer therapy at the screening process must have been on current therapy for at least four weeks. Alternatively, if they are planning to discontinue therapy before enrolling, they must have been off therapy for four weeks prior to enrollment.\n  * A minimum of four weeks must have elapsed since the most recent MAJOR surgical intervention.\n  * A minimum of two weeks must have elapsed since the most recent MINOR surgical procedure (e.g., port placement).\n  * In addition, eligible patients must not have a planned surgical procedure or course of radiation therapy during the 3-month study intervention period (i.e., the three months leading up to primary outcome evaluation-timepoint.\n* Patients who are no longer receiving anticancer therapy must be less than/equal to 5 years since the completion of their anticancer therapy (e.g., time since the last day of chemotherapy administration, time since last day of radiotherapy, etc.).\n* Must have pain indicated by a score of ≥ 4 on PROMIS Pain Intensity (1a) scale, using the Pain Eligibility Interview.\n* Must have a score of \"Most Days\" or higher on the Graded Chronic Pain Scale Revised (Abbreviated) using the Pain Eligibility Interview.\n* Patients do not have to be on analgesic medications of any kind in order to participate. If they are taking analgesics, they must be on a stable analgesic regimen (i.e., no changes to the prescribed analgesic regimen) over a period of at least 14 days prior to enrollment. Eligible patients should not have planned upward dose titration of their analgesics during the 3-month study intervention period (i.e., the three months leading up to primary outcome evaluation timepoint. Patients may elect to decrease their analgesic use during the study as per discussions with their provider. Unexpected dose adjustments including dose escalations as a result of unforeseen clinical need is allowed in all patients at all times during the study. Cannabis prescribed for medicinal purposes would qualify as an analgesic in this context.\n* Must have pain of new onset or significantly exacerbated since the time of cancer diagnosis or initiation of cancer treatment\n* Must be expected to be able to complete all study activities including the 22- and 34-week follow-up assessments according to the treating/referring clinician (e.g., treating clinician feels the patient is unlikely to develop progressive disease requiring additional active cancer therapy through the 6-month follow-up period).\n* ECOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2.\n* Age ≥18 years at the time of study entry\n* Must be able to speak, read and understand English.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
