Inadequate response to treatment is classified as either:\n\n  * Primary failure: The absence of any documented clinically significant response; or\n  * Secondary failure: Documented initial response with subsequent loss of that response or partial response\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
