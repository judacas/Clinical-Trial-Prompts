    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Low-SES\n2. Persistent smokers: cigarette smokers (at least 10 cigarettes/day for at least 1 year)\n3. Want to quit but have tried and failed at least once\n4. Income-to-needs ratio (INR) is less than 2.0, meaning that their household income adjusted for household size is below 200% of the federal poverty line\n5. Ages 25-55\n\nScan\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 25 Years\nMust have maximum age of 55 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Metal implants (e.g., braces, permanent retainers, pins)\n2. Metal fragments, pacemakers or other electronic medical implants\n3. Claustrophobia\n4. Weight Ëƒ 550 lbs.\n5. Women who are pregnant or believe they might be pregnant\n\nPeople in this population are likely to have some comorbid psychiatric, substance use, and/or other health disorders that might pose a challenge to retention and intervention compliance. Such comorbidities are inherent to the population of interest (persistent smokers) so they will not be exclusionary criteria; instead, we will gather information about psychiatric, substance use, and medical comorbidities on intake so that we can monitor and report any associations with attrition, compliance, and effects of the experimental conditions.\n\nE-cigarette use is acceptable - it is not an exclusionary criterion - but it will be recorded and covaried as appropriate in the analyses.\n\nTo increase the homogeneity of the sample in terms of cessation aids, we require that all participants use pharmacological cessation aids such as nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). This inclusion criterion also more realistically models how cessation happens in vivo, as medical care providers often recommend adding pharmacological assistance such as NRT to quit programs. We will provide patches or gum (e.g., Nicoderm) to participants who cannot afford. Participants who want or are able to provide their own NRT will be included as long as they agree to continue using NRT for the duration of the training period. We will monitor NRT use weekly to ensure compliance with this inclusion criterion.\n\nNo exclusions will be made on gender, race, or ethnicity, so the sample will reflect the demographic profile of the United States. Eligible participants will be scheduled for the Zoom pre-session.",
