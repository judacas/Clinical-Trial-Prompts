Postmenopause is defined as amenorrhea >= 12 consecutive months.\n  * NOTE: Women who have been amenorrheic for 12 or more months are still considered to be of childbearing potential if the amenorrhea is possibly due to prior chemotherapy, anti-estrogens, ovarian suppression or any other reversible treatment.\n* Ability to complete questionnaire(s) by themselves or with assistance.\n* Capable of understanding and complying with the protocol requirements and has signed the informed consent document.\n* Willing to return to enrolling institution for follow-up (during the active monitoring phase of the study).\n* Willing to provide tissue and blood samples for correlative research purposes.\n* Willing to allow transfer of tissue and blood samples, clinical information, and outcome data collected from this trial for future research.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
