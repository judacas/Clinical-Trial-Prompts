    "official_title": "Pilot Study of 7T MRI for Early Diagnosis of Melanoma Brain Metastases",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Melanoma patients with new untreated brain metastases seen on CE 3T MRI\n* Patient may have received previous systemic therapy, immunotherapy, or checkpoint inhibitors\n* Patient may have previous brain metastases treated >30 days prior with brain radiation, either whole brain radiation or radiosurgery\n* Age >= 18 years\n* Karnofsky performance status (KPS) >= 70\n* Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for 90 days following completion of therapy. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Women of child-bearing potential need negative urine human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) within 2 weeks prior to any treatment. A female of child-bearing potential is defined as any woman (regardless of sexual orientation, having undergone a tubal ligation, or remaining celibate by choice) who meets the following criteria:\n\n  * Has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or\n  * Has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months)\n* Ability to tolerate MRI (able to lie flat in supine position without undue anxiety or discomfort or history of claustrophobia)\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Patients who have had brain neurosurgery =< 30 days prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events related to that procedure\n* Patients who have had central nervous system (CNS)-directed radiotherapy =< 30 days prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 30 days earlier\n* Patients with claustrophobia or anxiety limiting ability to tolerate MRI scans. Unable to tolerate MRI scan without use of anxiolytic medication or with distress requiring termination of scan or resulting in scans of poor quality\n* Patients with MRI-incompatible pacemakers or MRI-incompatible implants\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCA) or other agents used in study\n* Patients with poor renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 30) or requiring dialysis\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements\n* Patients must not be pregnant or nursing due to the potential for congenital abnormalities and the potential of this regimen to harm nursing infants",
