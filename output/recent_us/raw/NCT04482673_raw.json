    "official_title": "Comparative Effectiveness of Intrapyloric Botulinum Toxin Injection Versus Pyloromyotomy for Pyloric Drainage During Esophagectomy: A Registry-Based, Pragmatic Randomized Noninferiority Trial",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* 18 years of age or older\n* Undergoing elective esophagectomy (thoracoabdominal, Ivor-Lewis, McKeown)\n* Receiving a gastric conduit for alimentary reconstruction\n* Technically able to receive either intrapyloric Botox injection or pyloromyotomy as ultimately determined intraoperatively\n* Willing and able to provide informed consent\n* Willing and able to participate in long-term follow up including study visits and surveys\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Undergoing emergent esophagectomy (e.g., for esophageal perforation)\n* Patients with underlying neuromuscular disease as Botox would be contraindicated (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, muscular dystrophies, Lambert-Eaton syndrome)\n* Patients undergoing left thoracoabdominal without left cervical neck incision (i.e., Sweet esophagectomy) - excluded due to the extent of gastric resection\n* Pregnancy\n* Allergy or hypersensitivity to botulinum toxin\n* Cannot feasibly receive both pyloric interventions as determined intraoperatively (e.g., patients with central obesity undergoing thoracoabdominal esophagectomy makes for a technically difficult pyloromyotomy)",
