    "exclusion_criteria": "* Major comorbidities that would cause danger to the patient when participating in the study and that would have a risk of progression if the patient took part in the study (including, but not limited to): cardiac or pulmonary and infectious diseases (e.g., ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia) or, psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements\n* Unwilling or unable to follow protocol requirements\n* Any condition which in the investigator's opinion deems the participant an unsuitable candidate to take part in study intervention (comorbidities, myeloma symptoms, treatment side effects)\n* MODULE A (PHYSICAL ACTIVITY): Current and symptomatic pathological fracture(s) or severely advanced instability of the musculo-skeletal system that is deemed to making the patient unsafe to participate.
