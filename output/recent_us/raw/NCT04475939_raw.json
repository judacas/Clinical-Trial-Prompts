    "official_title": "Pilot Study of Atezolizumab Plus PGV001, a Multipeptide Personalized Neoantigen Vaccine, in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metad or Metastatic Urothelial Cancer",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Written informed consent and HIPAA authorization for release of personal health information.\n* Age ≥ 18 years at the time of consent.\n* ECOG Performance Status of ≤ 1 within fourteen days of registration for protocol therapy.\n* Histological or cytological evidence of urothelial cancer of the bladder, urethra, ureter, or renal pelvis. Differentiation with variant histologies (e.g., squamous cell differentiated) or pure variant histologies will be permitted provided that the predominant histology is urothelial carcinoma.\n* Clinical disease state specific criteria:\n\n  * Subjects with invasive urothelial cancer of the bladder or upper urinary tract may consent either before or within 6 weeks after radical cystectomy or nephroureterectomy.\n  * Subjects with metastatic and/or unresectable disease must have a metastatic site amenable to biopsy. In situations where a metastatic biopsy does not yield sufficient genetic material for sequencing, or a biopsy cannot be feasibly performed, the use of archival tumor tissue may be considered on a case by case basis. The archival tissue must be derived from a muscle-invasive urothelial cancer specimen or metastatic urothelial cancer specimen.\n* Required laboratory values must be obtained within thirty days of consent.\n\n  * ANC ≥ 1500 cells/µL\n  * WBC counts > 2500/µL\n  * Lymphocyte count ≥ 300/µL\n  * Platelet count ≥ 100,000/µL\n  * Hemoglobin ≥ 8.0 g/dL\n  * Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) with the following exception:\n\n    o Patients with known Gilbert disease who have serum bilirubin level ≤ 3 x ULN may be enrolled.\n  * AST and ALT ≤ 3.0 x ULN with the following exception:\n\n    o Patients with liver involvement: AST and/or ALT ≤ 5 x ULN\n  * Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 x ULN with the following exception:\n\n    o Patients with documented liver involvement or bone metastases: alkaline phosphatase ≤ 5 x ULN\n  * Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN or creatinine clearance ≥ 30 mL/min on the basis of the Cockcroft-Gault glomerular filtration rate estimation:\n  * (140 - age) x (weight in kg) x (0.85 if female) / 72 x (serum creatinine in mg/dL)\n  * INR and aPTT ≤ 1.5 x ULN o This applies only to patients who do not receive therapeutic anticoagulation; patients receiving therapeutic anticoagulation (such as low-molecular-weight heparin or warfarin) should be on a stable dose.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Known clinically significant liver disease, including active viral, alcoholic, or other hepatitis; cirrhosis; fatty liver; and inherited liver disease\n* Symptomatic CNS metastases and/or metastases to brain stem, midbrain, pons, medulla, cerebellum, or within 10 mm of the optic apparatus (optic nerves and chiasm) and/or history of intracranial hemorrhage or spinal cord hemorrhage\n* Pregnancy, lactation, or breastfeeding\n* Known hypersensitivity to Chinese hamster ovary cell products or other recombinant human antibodies\n* History or risk of autoimmune disease, including but not limited to systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, vascular thrombosis associated with antiphospholipid syndrome, Wegener's granulomatosis, Sjögren's syndrome, Bell's palsy, Guillain-Barré syndrome, multiple sclerosis, autoimmune thyroid disease, vasculitis, or glomerulonephritis\n* Patients with a history of autoimmune hypothyroidism on a stable dose of thyroid replacement hormone may be eligible.\n* Patients with controlled Type 1 diabetes mellitus on a stable insulin regimen may be eligible.\n* Patients with eczema, psoriasis, lichen simplex chronicus of vitiligo with dermatologic manifestations only (e.g., patients with psoriatic arthritis would be excluded) are permitted provided that they meet the following conditions:\n* History of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, pneumonitis (including drug induced), organizing pneumonia (i.e., bronchiolitis obliterans, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, etc.), or evidence of active pneumonitis on screening chest computed tomography (CT) scan\n\n  o History of radiation pneumonitis in the radiation field (fibrosis) is permitted.\n* History of HIV infection or active hepatitis B (chronic or acute) or hepatitis C infection\n* Active tuberculosis\n* A known additional primary malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment. Exceptions include cancers that have undergone potentially curative therapy.\n* Medication-Related Exclusion Criteria:\n\n  * Prior treatment with anti-PD-1, or anti-PD-L1 therapeutic antibody or pathway targeting agents\n  * No history of severe immune-related adverse effects from anti-CTLA 4 (NCI CTCAE Grade 3 and 4)\n  * History of severe allergic, anaphylactic, or other hypersensitivity reactions to chimeric or humanized antibodies or fusion proteins\n  * Patients with prior allogeneic bone marrow transplantation or prior solid organ transplantation\n\nPlease contact site for other inclusion/exclusion criteria.",
