    "inclusion_criteria": "* Participants must have Lynch syndrome defined as meeting any of the following: (1) Mutation-positive Lynch syndrome: carriers or obligate carriers (by pedigree) of a pathogenic mutation in one of the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) mismatch repair (MMR) genes (i.e. MLH1, MSH2/EPCAM, MSH6, or PMS2) or (2) Mutation-negative Lynch syndrome: patients with a personal history of a non-sporadic MMR deficient premalignant lesion (i.e. polyp) or a non sporadic MMR deficient malignant tumor (where non-sporadic MMR deficient is defined by: microsatellite instability high by either immunohistochemistry or microsatellite instability (MSI) testing or both, but no evidence of MLH1 promoter methylation in cases with loss of both MLH1 and PMS2, and/or no evidence of BRAF mutation in cases with loss of both MLH1 and PMS2) but germline MMR genetic testing showed either a variant of unknown significance or mutation negative result or had declined germline MMR genetic testing.\n* Participants must not have evidence of active/recurrent malignant disease for a minimum of 6 months.\n* Participants must be at least 6 months from any prior cancer-directed treatment (such as surgical resection, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, hormonal therapy or radiation).\n* Participants must have endoscopically accessible distal colon and/or rectal mucosa (i.e. participants must have at least part of the descending/sigmoid colon and/or rectum intact).\n* Participants must consent to two standard of care lower gastro-intestinal GI endoscopy (flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy) with biopsies that will be 12 months (+/-21 days) apart.\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n* Must have normal cardiopulmonary exercise test prior to exercise participation.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 50 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Individuals who are status post total proctocolectomy (i.e. removal of all colon and rectum).\n* Individuals with history of myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary-artery bypass draft, invasive coronary revascularization, arrhythmia requiring treatment such as atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, pulmonary embolism, or deep venous thrombosis.\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, uncontrolled hypertension, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* Individuals with a history of diabetes, hypertension, or have smoked cigarettes in the last 12 months.\n* Individuals who are unable to participate in cycling due to musculoskeletal limitations.\n* Individuals who are unable to identify cycling classes in their community for exercise.",
