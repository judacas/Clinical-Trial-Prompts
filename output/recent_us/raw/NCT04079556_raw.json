Use of these agents together or as maintenance therapy is considered 1 regimen.\n* Recovery to baseline or ≤ Grade 1 severity (CTCAE v5) from adverse events (AEs), including immune-related adverse events (irAEs), related to any prior treatments, unless AE(s) are clinically nonsignificant and/or stable on supportive therapy (eg, physiological replacement of corticosteroid). Low-grade or controlled toxicities such as alopecia, ≤ Grade 2 hypomagnesemia, ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy are permitted)\n* Patients must have disease that cannot be managed by local therapy targeted at the tumor site (i.e. surgery, radiation therapy).\n* Measurable disease by RECIST 1.1.\n* At least 18 years of age.\n* ECOG performance status ≤ 2.\n* Normal bone marrow and organ function within 14 days prior to first dose of study treatment, as defined below:\n\n  * Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 K/cumm without granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support within 2 weeks of screening laboratory sample collection.\n  * Platelets ≥ 100 K/cumm ) without transfusion within 2 weeks of screening laboratory sample collection.\n  * Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL without transfusion within 2 weeks prior to screening laboratory sample collection.\n  * Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x IULN (for subjects with Gilbert's disease ≤ 3 x ULN).\n  * Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) ≤ 3 x ULN.

In addition, females < 55 years-of-age must have a serum follicle stimulating hormone [FSH] level > 40 mIU/mL to confirm menopause). Note: Documentation may include review of medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview by study site staff. Should a patient become pregnant or suspect pregnancy while participating in this study, the treating physician must be informed immediately.\n* The effects of zanzalintinib on the developing human fetus are unknown.
