    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Patients with known brain metastases.\n2. Grade 3 Cystitis infective and non-infective.\n3. Severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric conditions or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with the study participation or the study treatment administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the Investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for enrollment in this study.\n4. Previous treatment with Actinium-225, Strontium-89, Samarium-153, Rhenium-186, Rhenium-188, or hemi-body irradiation or any other radionuclide therapy except [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 or Radium-223.\n5. Radium-223 within 6 months prior to the first study treatment administration.\n6. [177Lu]-Lu-PSMA-617 within 6 weeks prior to first study treatment administration. Adverse events related to [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 are required to be either resolved or of grade 1 prior to the first study treatment administration.\n7. Any systemic anti-cancer therapy (e.g., chemotherapy, immunotherapy or biological therapy [including monoclonal antibodies]) within 6 weeks prior to the first study treatment administration. Patients on a stable bisphosphonate or denosumab regimen for 30 days prior to first study treatment administration are eligible.\n8. Any investigational agents within 6 weeks prior to the first study treatment administration.\n9. Radiotherapy: external beam radiotherapy that encompasses >30% of bone marrow completed less than 6 weeks or focal radiation completed less than 2 weeks, prior to the first study treatment administration.\n10. Major surgery (not including placement of vascular access device or tumor biopsies) within 6 weeks prior to first dose of the study treatment, or no recovery from side effects of such intervention.\n11. Symptomatic cord compression, or clinical or radiologic findings indicative of impending cord compression.\n12. Known hypersensitivity to the components of the study therapy or its analogs.\n13. Enrollment in another interventional clinical study.\n14. Known history of myelodysplastic syndrome.",
