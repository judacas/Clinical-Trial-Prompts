    "official_title": "Phase 2 Study of Cabozantinib Combined With Ipilimumab/Nivolumab and Transarterial Chemoembolization (TACE) in Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) Who Are Not Candidates for Curative Intent Treatment",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Histologic or radiographic diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma\n* At least one lesion amenable to TACE treatment\n* Child-Pugh A-B7 (B7 based on Albumin allowed)\n* Not a candidate for resection or transplantation\n* Age ≥ 18 years.\n* Performance status: ECOG performance status ≤2\n* Must have at least one measurable lesion (either untreated or progressed after previous locoregional treatment)\n* Adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:\n\n  1. Leukocytes ≥ 2,000/mcL\n  2. absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1000/mcL\n  3. platelets ≥ 60,000/mcl\n  4. total bilirubin within normal institutional limits\n  5. AST(SGOT)/ALT(SPGT) ≤ 3 X institutional upper limit of normal or ≤ 5 X if liver metastases are present\n  6. creatinine <1.5ULN\n  7. hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL\n  8. Serum albumin ≥ 2.8 g/dL\n  9. Urine protein/creatinine ration (UPCR) ≤ 1 mg/mg\n* The effects of cabozantinib on the developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic dose are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for 4 months following completion of therapy. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.\n\nBased on its mechanism of action, ipilimumab can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Females of reproductive potential must use effective contraception during treatment with ipilimumab and for 3 months following the last dose of ipilimumab.\n\nBased on its mechanism of action, nivolumab can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Females of reproductive potential must use effective contraception during treatment with nivolumab and for 5 months following the last dose of nivolumab.\n\n1. A female of child-bearing potential is any woman (regardless of sexual orientation, having undergone a tubal ligation, or remaining celibate by choice) who meets the following criteria:\n\n1. Has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or\n2. Has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months).\n\n   * Life expectancy of greater than 3 months\n   * Ability to swallow tablets\n   * Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
