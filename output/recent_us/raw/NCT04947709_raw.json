Monitoring of calcium level in regular intervals (usually prior to investigational product [IP] administration) is highly recommended\n* Tamoxifen, raloxifene or aromatase inhibitor use during the last 3 months prior to randomization or for a duration of more than 3 years in total (current and prior hormone replacement therapy [HRT] is permitted)\n* Prior use of denosumab\n* Subject has a known prior history or current evidence of osteonecrosis or osteomyelitis of the jaw, or an active dental/jaw condition which requires oral surgery including tooth extraction within 3 months of enrollment\n* Concurrent treatment with a bisphosphonate or an anti-angiogenic agent\n* Any major medical or psychiatric condition that may prevent the subject from completing the study\n* Known active infection with hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus\n* Known infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\n* Use of any other investigational product (current or prior aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs] are permitted)",
