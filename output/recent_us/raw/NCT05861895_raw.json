    "official_title": "An Open-label, Randomized, Controlled Phase 3 Study of Disitamab Vedotin in Combination With Pembrolizumab Versus Chemotherapy in Subjects With Previously Untreated Locally Advanced or Metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma That Expresses HER2 (IHC 1+ and Greater)",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Histopathological confirmation of locally advanced unresectable or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (LA/mUC), including UC originating from the renal pelvis, ureters, bladder, or urethra.\n* Measurable disease by investigator assessment per RECIST v1.1.\n* Participant must not have received prior systemic therapy for LA/mUC. Exception will be made for neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy, if disease recurrence/progression occurred more than 12 months after the last dose of therapy.\n* Eligible to receive cisplatin- or carboplatin-containing chemotherapy.\n* Able to provide archived formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue blocks from a muscle-invasive or metastatic UC lesion or biopsy of metastatic UC prior to treatment initiation. If archival tissue is not available a newly obtained baseline biopsy of an accessible tumor lesion is required within 28 days of cycle 1 day 1.\n* HER2 expression of 1+ or greater on immunohistochemistry (IHC).\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score of 0, 1, or 2 within 7 days prior to randomization.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Known hypersensitivity to disitamab vedotin, cisplatin, carboplatin, gemcitabine, or pembrolizumab or any of their components.\n* History of severe/life threatening immune-related adverse event (irAE) with PD-(L)1 inhibitors are excluded.\n* Central nervous system (CNS) and/or leptomeningeal metastasis. Participants with treated CNS metastases are permitted if all of the following are met.\n\n  * CNS metastases have been clinically stable for at least 4 weeks and baseline scans show no evidence of new or worsening CNS metastasis.\n  * Participant is on a stable dose of â‰¤ 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent for at least 2 weeks.\n* History of or active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years.\n* Prior treatment with an agent directed to another stimulatory or co-inhibitory T cell receptor (including but not limited to CD137 agonists, CAR-T cell therapy, CTLA-4 inhibitors, or OX-40 agonists).\n* Prior solid organ or bone marrow transplantation.\n* Pleural effusion or ascites with symptoms or requiring symptomatic treatment.\n* Estimated life expectancy <12 week\n* Prior treatment with an MMAE agent or anti-HER2 therapy",
