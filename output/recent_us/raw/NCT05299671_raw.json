Participants with Ewing sarcoma (Cohort 2 only) should have evidence of EWS translocation by FISH or RT-PCR.\n\nNOTE: Histologic confirmation of original diagnosis or relapse is required by the Laboratory of Pathology, NCI or participating site s Pathology Department. A formalin fixed tissue block or at least 5 unstained slides (10 micron thick) of archival tumor sample must be available at the time of enrollment. Participants under 18 years old without adequate archival tissue available may opt to undergo pre-treatment biopsy if it can be performed with minimal morbidity. In the event that a participants under 18 cannot safely undergo biopsy and does not have adequate archival tissue available, enrollment will be at the discretion of the Study Chair.\n\n* Measurable disease:\n\n  * For phase 1, participants must have measurable (per RECIST 1.1.) or non-measurable disease on imaging, or presence of recurrent/residual disease identified on aspirate/biopsy or due to presence of elevated tumor biomarkers.\n  * For phase 2, participants must have measurable disease, per RECIST 1.1.\n* Prior therapy:\n\n  * For phase 1, there are no limits to the number of prior treatment regimens\n  * For phase 2, there are no limits to the number of prior treatment regimens. However, participants must not have received any prior therapy with an irinotecan/temozolomide combination containing regimen (participants may have received either drug alone or in combination with different agents at different periods of their course).\n  * For all participants: Participants must have recovered from the acute side effects of their prior therapy, such that eligibility criteria are met.\n\nThe following prior therapies are permitted, given the indicated time has elapsed:\n\n* Cytotoxic chemotherapy or other anti-cancer agents known to be myelosuppressive. At least 21 days must have elapsed after the last dose of cytotoxic or myelosuppressive chemotherapy (42 days if prior nitrosourea).\n* Anti-cancer agents not known to be myelosuppressive (which can include biologic agent, targeted agent, tyrosine kinase inhibitor, or a metronomic non-myelosuppressive regimen): >=7 days must have elapsed after the last dose of agent.\n* Antibodies including checkpoint inhibitors: >= 21 days or 3 half-lives (whichever is shorter) must have elapsed from infusion of last dose of antibody.\n* Systemic corticosteroids: Participants may be on physiologic steroid replacement for adrenal insufficiency or chronic corticosteroids at a stable dose for at least 7 days. Participants undergoing a steroid wean are eligible as long as no dose re-escalation has occurred in the prior 7 days. If steroids are being used to modify immune adverse events related to prior therapy, >= 14 days must have elapsed since last dose of corticosteroid, unless the participant is receiving physiologic steroid replacement for adrenal insufficiency.\n* Hematopoietic growth factors: >= 14 days after the last dose of a long-acting growth factor (e.g., pegfilgrastim) or 7 days for short-acting growth factor.\n* Interleukins, interferons and cytokines (other than hematopoietic growth factors): >= 21 days must have elapsed after the completion of dose\n* Stem cell infusions (with or without total body irradiation [TBI]):\n\n  * Allogeneic (non-autologous) bone marrow or stem cell transplant, or any stem cell infusion including DLI or boost infusion: >= 84 days must have elapsed after infusion and no evidence of GVHD.\n  * Autologous stem cell infusion including boost infusion: >= 42 days must have elapsed.\n  * Cellular Therapy: >= 42 days must have elapsed after the completion of any type of cellular therapy (e.g., modified T cells, NK cells, dendritic cells, etc.).\n* XRT/External Beam Irradiation including Protons: >= 84 days after TBI, craniospinal XRT or if radiation to >= 50% of the pelvis; >= 42 days if other substantial bone marrow radiation. >= 14 days after local XRT however there is no time restriction for palliative radiation with minimal bone marrow involvement and the participant has measurable/evaluable disease outside the radiation port or the site of radiation has documented progression.\n* Radiopharmaceutical therapy (e.g., radiolabeled antibody, 131I-MIBG): >= 42 days must have elapsed after systemically administered radiopharmaceutical therapy.\n\n  * Age >= 12 years and <= 39 years\n\nNOTE: Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of PEN-866 in participants <18 years of age, children <12 years of age are excluded from this study but will be eligible for future pediatric trials. Since the study population of interest is relapsed or refractory sarcomas which is typically seen in adolescents and young adults, and per FDA recommendations for enrolling adolescents in disease/target-appropriate adult oncology clinical trials of investigational agents, eligibility will include participants aged 12-17 years old.\n\n* ECOG performance status <=2, (Karnofsky >=50% for participants > 16 years of age and Lansky >= 50% for participants <= 16 years of age.

Participants must be asymptomatic from their brain metastasis and not require corticosteroids for 4 weeks prior to start of therapy (C1D1). Participants with remote history of spinal cord compression are eligible.\n  * Participants with new or progressive brain metastases (active brain metastases) or leptomeningeal disease are eligible if the treating physician determines that immediate CNS specific treatment is not required and is unlikely to be required during the first cycle of therapy.
