Subjects are eligible if the stenosis/stricture is dilated to at least 15mm, but baseline treatment may need to be delayed.\n* Any endoscopically-visualized abnormalities such as ulcers, masses or nodules during screening/baseline EGD within 3 cm of the treatment area.\n* Subjects with nodular polyps or suspicion of invasive cancer by white light endoscopy /enhanced imaging/biopsy identified during screening/baseline EGD\n* Suspicion of malignancy by abdominal or endoscopic ultrasound imaging based on malignant lymph nodes, invasion of lesion beyond mucosa.\n* EMR or polypectomy < 6 weeks prior to baseline treatment.\n* Untreated invasive esophageal malignancy, including margin-positive EMR.\n* Active duodenitis in treatment zone during screening/baseline EGD.\n* Severe medical comorbidities precluding endoscopy, or limiting life expectancy to less than 2 years in the judgment of the endoscopist.\n* Uncontrolled coagulopathy or inability to be off anticoagulation or anti-platelet medication per standards of the institutions performing cryoablation.\n* Known portal hypertension, visible esophageal, gastric, or duodenal varices, or history of varices.\n* General poor health, multiple co-morbidities placing the patient at risk, or otherwise unsuitable for trial participation.\n* Pregnant or planning to become pregnant during period of study participation.\n* Patient refuses or is unable to provide written informed consent.",
