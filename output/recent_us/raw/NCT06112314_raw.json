    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Patients must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n2. Participants must have confirmed clinically localized bladder cancer with histology of urothelial cell carcinoma or variant histology and radiographic imaging consistent with stage T2-T3 N0 disease. Patients must be planned for cystectomy as part of their clinical care. The lesion planned for excision must be at least 1cm in size.\n3. Participants must be 18 years of age or older. Patients must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n4. Participants must have confirmed clinically localized bladder cancer with histology of urothelial cell carcinoma or variant histology and radiographic imaging consistent with stage T2-T3 N0 disease. Patients must be planned for cystectomy as part of their clinical care. The lesion planned for excision must be at least 1cm in size.\n5. Participants must be 18 years of age or older. Patients must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n6. Participants must have confirmed clinically localized bladder cancer with histology of urothelial cell carcinoma or variant histology and radiographic imaging consistent with stage T2-T3 N0 disease. Patients must be planned for cystectomy as part of their clinical care. The lesion planned for excision must be at least 1cm in size.\n7. Participants must be 18 years of age or older.\n8. Participants must be evaluated by a medical oncologist who will determine the clinically appropriate treatment strategy based on clinical history and extent of disease.\n9. Patients must be deemed medically stable to undergo both percutaneous procedures and standard-of-care surgical procedures.\n10. Participants will undergo laboratory testing within 30 days prior to the procedure (or within 72 hours if there has been a change in the clinical status since the initial blood draw). Patients must have absolute neutrophil count ≥1,000/mcL, platelets ≥50,000/mcL, PT (INR) 1.5 and PTT<1.5x control.\n11. Participants must have undergone CT or MRI that assesses the extent of disease and allows the research team to assess for study eligibility. This will have been done as part of the standard-of-care.\n12. The participant's case must be reviewed by the treating physician to assess the following factors:\n\n    * Patient is clinically stable to undergo microdevice implantation and surgical procedures\n    * Patient has sufficient volume of disease to allow implantation of the microdevice\n    * Patient has a lesion for which the microdevice is a) amenable to percutaneous placement, and b) amenable to removal at the time of surgery\n13. Patients must be willing to undergo research-related genetic sequencing (somatic and germline) and data management, including the deposition of de-identified genetic sequencing data in NIH central data repositories.\n14. Patients must be agree to remain abstinent or use contraceptive measures for the duration of the study period\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 120 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, unstable cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit the safety of a biopsy and/or surgery.\n2. Uncorrectable bleeding or coagulation disorder known to cause increased risk with surgical or biopsy procedures (detailed below in section 5.1.2.1).",
