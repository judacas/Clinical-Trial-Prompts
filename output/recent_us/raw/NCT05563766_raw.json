Treated or untreated asymptomatic parenchymal CNS disease or leptomeningeal disease is allowed.\n4. Presence of ≥1 measurable lesion (scan done ≤28 days of C1D1) to serve as target lesion according to relevant criteria\n5. ECOG performance status of 0-1. For subjects with primary CNS tumors, KPS score ≥70.\n6. Acceptable organ function\n7. For all prior anticancer treatment, a duration of 30 days or 5 half-lives of the agents used, whichever is shorter, must have elapsed, and any encountered toxicity must have resolved to levels meeting all the other eligibility criteria prior to the first dose of study treatment. Palliative radiotherapy to non-target lesions should be completed within 2 weeks prior to APL-101 administration.\n8. Adequate cardiac function\n9. Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative serum or Beta-hCG at screening or evidence of surgical sterility or evidence of post-menopausal status\n10. No planned major surgery within 4 weeks of first dose of APL-101\n11. Expected survival (life expectancy) ≥ 3 months from C1D1\n12. Provision of sample; e.g. archival or a fresh tumor biopsy sample (if safe and feasible) either from the primary or a metastatic site) or liquid biopsy sample (if tumor tissue is insufficient or lacking, and approved by the sponsor) is required for prospective central lab confirmation for study entry (subjects with previously confirmed molecular status by the Sponsor designated central lab or FDA approved NGS based MET testing may be exempted, subjected to Sponsor approval.\n\nMajor\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Hypersensitivity to APL-101, excipients of the drug product, or other components of the study treatment regimen.\n2. Known actionable mutation/gene rearrangement of EGFR (except for NSCLC subjects in Cohort C and C-2), ALK, ROS1, RET, NTRK, KRAS, and BRAF.\n3. Use or intended use of any other investigational product, including herbal medications, through Study Treatment Termination.\n4. Active uncontrolled systemic bacterial, viral, or fungal infection or clinically significant, active disease process, which in the opinion of the investigator makes the risk: benefit unfavorable for the participation of the trial.\n5. Life-threatening illness, significant organ system dysfunction or comorbid conditions, or other reasons that, in the investigator's opinion, could compromise the subject's safety or the integrity of the study outcomes, or interfere with the absorption or metabolism of APL-101.\n6. Unstable angina or myocardial infarction within 1 year prior to first dose of APL-101, symptomatic or unstable arrhythmia requiring medical therapy, history of congenital prolonged QT syndrome, prolonged QT interval corrected by Fridericia formula (QTcF) at screening, or concurrent treatment with a medication that is a known risk for prolonging the QT interval. Chronic controlled atrial fibrillation is not excluded.\n7. Historical seropositive results consistent with active infection for hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV) with high viral loads not actively managed with antiviral therapy and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive subjects who are not clinically stable or controlled on their medication (asymptomatic subjects with CD4+ T-cell (CD4+) counts ≥ 350 cells/μL and have not had an opportunistic infection within the past 12 months prior to first dose of APL-101 would be eligible for study entry. If history is unclear, relevant test(s) at Screening will be required to confirm eligibility.\n8. Known significant mental illness or other conditions such as active alcohol or other substance abuse that, in the opinion of the investigator, predisposes the subject to high risk of noncompliance with the protocol treatment or assessments.\n9. Unable to swallow orally administered medication whole.\n10. Impairment of gastrointestinal function or gastrointestinal disease that may significantly alter drug absorption\n11. Women who are breastfeeding\n12. History of another malignancy within 3 years prior to C1D1. A subject with the following malignancies is allowed if considered cured or unlikely to recur within 3 years:\n\n    1. Carcinoma of the skin without melanomatous features.\n    2. Curatively treated cervical carcinoma in situ.\n    3. Bladder tumors considered superficial such as noninvasive (T1a) and carcinoma in situ (T1s), thyroid papillary cancer with prior treatment, prostate cancer which has been surgically or medically treated and not likely to recur within 3 years.\n13. Subjects who are unable or unwilling to discontinue excluded medications (drugs with known QTc risk and known strong cytochrome P450 [CYP]3A4 inducer and/or strong inhibitors) for at least 5 half-lives prior to first dose of study drug. Subjects may qualify if such medication(s) can be safely replaced with alternate medications with less risk of drug-drug interaction.\n14. Subjects with active COVID-19 infection.\n15. Symptomatic and/or neurologically unstable CNS metastases, or who require an increase in steroid dose to control CNS disease. Subjects who have been receiving a stable steroid dose for at least 2 weeks prior to C1D1 may be allowed.",
