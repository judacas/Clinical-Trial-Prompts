    "inclusion_criteria": "Individuals from populations who are underrepresented in clinical research (e.g., racial and ethnic minorities, women, individuals from rural/frontier communities, older individuals) will be enrolled with a goal of ensuring that all eligible patients are given the opportunity to participate in novel clinical trials and that research findings can be generalizable to the entire population.\n\n* Male or female ≥ 18 years of age at time of consent.\n* Subjects with histologically confirmed breast cancer that is advanced (defined as metastatic or unresectable).\n\n  * Phase II Cohort A: Patients with advanced triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) with negative or unknown germline BRCA status. Variants of undetermined significance in BRCA 1/2 should be considered negative.\n\n    * Note: most recent tumor biopsy must be ER/PR negative or have ER and PR <10% and all prior biopsies of metastatic sites cannot have ever had ER or PR ≥20%.\n    * Note: HER2 is considered negative if ISH negative by ASCO/CAP guidelines or HER2+ 0 or 1+ on IHC or 2+ with negative ISH\n  * Phase II Cohort B [CLOSED]: Patients with advanced HER2 negative breast cancer and a germline BRCA1 or 2 (1/2) mutation\n\n    ---Note: HER2 is considered negative if ISH negative by ASCO/CAP guidelines or HER2+ 0 or 1+ on IHC or 2+ with negative ISH\n  * Phase I run-in: meets criteria for either cohort A or B\n\n    * Phase I run-in: Measurable or evaluable (non-measurable) disease (see section 9.2 for more detail).\n    * Phase II: Measurable disease by RECIST 1.1 is required.\n    * Prior therapy:\n  * Cohort A: At least one line of prior systemic therapy for advanced breast cancer (chemotherapy or other targeted therapy allowed). No more than 3 lines of prior chemotherapy for advanced disease are allowed. No limit on prior endocrine or targeted therapies.\n  * Cohort B [CLOSED]: No more than 2 lines of prior chemotherapy for advanced disease are allowed. No limit on prior endocrine or targeted therapies.\n  * Both cohorts: no prior PARP inhibitor for advanced breast cancer\n* Has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1, or 2 within 28 days prior to study registration.\n* Life expectancy of 12 weeks or greater as determined by the treating physician.\n* Demonstrate adequate organ function as defined in the table in the protocol; all screening labs to be obtained within 28 days prior to registration.\n* Archived tumor tissue available (Metastatic disease from non-bone and non-brain sites preferred, but primary breast or lymph node tissue is permitted. Confirmation of available tissue only- tumor samples do not need to be shipped for eligibility purposes. Tumor samples do not need to be shipped until subject is confirmed eligible and is registered for treatment.\n* Ability to take oral medications.\n* No history of type I diabetes. For patients with known type II diabetes, must have controlled diabetes (Hgb A1c < 7.0 mmol/L within 30 days of study entry) with no more than one oral anti-diabetic agent and no insulin.\n* No active central nervous system (CNS) metastatic disease. NOTE: Subjects with CNS involvement must meet ALL of the following to be eligible:\n\n  * At least 28 days from prior definitive treatment of their CNS disease by surgical resection, SBRT or WBRT at the time of registration\n  * Asymptomatic and off systemic corticosteroids and/or enzyme-inducing antiepileptic medications for brain metastases for >14 days prior to registration.\n* Provided written informed consent and HIPAA authorization for release of personal health information, approved by an Institutional Review Board (IRB).\n* NOTE: HIPAA authorization may be included in the informed consent or obtained separately.\n* Women of childbearing potential (WOCP) must not be pregnant or breast-feeding. A negative serum or urine pregnancy test is required within 14 days of study registration. If the urine test cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required.\n* Women of childbearing potential (WOCP) must be willing to use two effective methods of birth control such as an oral, implantable, injectable, or transdermal hormonal contraceptive, an intrauterine device (IUD), use of a double barrier method (condoms, sponge, diaphragm, or vaginal ring with spermicidal jellies or cream), vasectomized partner, or total abstinence from the time of informed consent, throughout the course of the study, and for at least 7 months after the last dose of study drug.\n* NOTE; Women are considered to be of childbearing potential unless they are postmenopausal (≥45 years of age and has not had menses for greater than 12 consecutive months) or bilateral oophorectomy or surgically sterile (bilateral tubal ligation or hysterectomy) or not heterosexually active for the duration of the study and willing to continue for at least 7 months after the last dose of study drug.\n* Men who are not surgically sterile (vasectomy) must agree to use an acceptable method of contraception. Male subjects with female sexual partners who are pregnant, possibly pregnant, or who could become pregnant during the study must agree to use condoms from the first dose of study drug through at least 4 months after the last dose of study drug. Total abstinence for the same time period is an acceptable alternative.\n* As determined by the enrolling physician or protocol designee, ability of the subject to understand and comply with study procedures for the entire length of the study.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Active infection requiring systemic therapy.
