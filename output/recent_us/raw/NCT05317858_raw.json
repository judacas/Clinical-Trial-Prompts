    "official_title": "A Phase 3 Study of Dinutuximab Added to Intensive Multimodal Therapy for Children With Newly Diagnosed High-Risk Neuroblastoma",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Patients must be enrolled on APEC14B1 and have consented to testing through the Molecular Characterization Initiative (MCI), prior to enrollment on ANBL2131\n* ≤ 30 years at the time of initial diagnosis with high-risk disease\n* * Must have a diagnosis of neuroblastoma (NBL) or ganglioneuroblastoma (nodular) verified by tumor pathology analysis or demonstration of clumps of tumor cells in bone marrow with elevated urinary catecholamines\n\n  * Newly diagnosed, high risk neuroblastoma (HRNBL) defined as one of the following:\n\n    * Any age with International Neuroblastoma Risk Group (INRG) Stage L2, MS, or M and MYCN amplification\n    * Age ≥ 547 days and INRG stage M regardless of biologic features (clinical MYCN testing not required prior to enrollment)\n    * Any age initially diagnosed with INRG Stage L1 MYCN amplified NBL who have progressed to stage M without systemic chemotherapy\n    * Age ≥ 547 days of age initially diagnosed with INRG Stage L1, L2, or MS who have progressed to stage M without systemic chemotherapy (clinical MYCN testing not required prior to enrollment)\n* Patients must have a body surface area (BSA) ≥ 0.25 m^2\n* No prior anti-cancer therapy except as outlined below:\n\n  * Patients initially recognized to have high-risk disease treated with topotecan/cyclophosphamide initiated on an emergent basis and within allowed timing, and with consent\n  * Patients observed or treated with a single cycle of chemotherapy per a low or intermediate risk neuroblastoma regimen (e.g., as per ANBL0531, ANBL1232 or similar) for what initially appeared to be non-high-risk disease but subsequently found to meet the criteria\n  * Patients who received localized emergency radiation to sites of life threatening or function-threatening disease prior to or immediately after establishment of the definitive diagnosis\n* Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -infected patients on effective anti-retroviral therapy with undetectable viral load within 6 months are eligible for this trial\n* A serum creatinine based on age/sex as follows:\n\n  * 1 month to < 6 months: Male 0.4 mg/dL and female 0.4mg/dL\n  * 6 months to < 1 year: Male 0.5 mg/dL and female 0.5 mg/dL\n  * 1 to < 2 years: Male 0.6 mg/dL and female 0.6 mg/dL\n  * 2 to < 6 years: Male 0.8 mg/dL and female 0.8 mg/dL\n  * 6 to < 10 years: Male 1 mg/dL and female 1 mg/dL\n  * 10 to < 13 years: Male 1.2 mg/dL and female 1.2 mg/dL\n  * 13 to < 16 years: Male 1.5 mg/dL and female 1.4 mg/dL\n  * ≥ 16 years: Male 1.7 mg/dL and female 1.4 mg/dL\n\n    * The threshold creatinine values were derived from the Schwartz formula for estimating glomerular filtration rate (GFR) utilizing child length and stature data published by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC)\n  * or a 24-hour urine creatinine clearance ≥ 70 mL/min/1.73 m^2 or\n  * or a GFR ≥ 70 mL/min/1.73 m^2. GFR must be performed using direct measurement with a nuclear blood sampling method or direct small molecule clearance method (iothalamate or other molecule per institutional standard)\n\n    * Note: Estimated GFR (eGFR) from serum creatinine, cystatin C or other estimates are not acceptable for determining eligibility\n* Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) for age\n* Serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) (Alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) ≤ 10 x ULN*\n\n  * Note: For the purpose of this study, the ULN for SGPT (ALT) has been set to the value of 45 U/L\n* * Shortening fraction of ≥ 27% by echocardiogram, or\n\n  * Ejection fraction of ≥ 50% by echocardiogram or radionuclide angiogram\n* Ability to tolerate Peripheral Blood Stem Cell (PBSC) collection:\n\nNo known contraindication to PBSC collection. Examples of contraindications might be a weight or size less than the collecting institution finds feasible, or a physical condition that would limit the ability of the child to undergo apheresis catheter placement (if necessary) and/or the apheresis procedure\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have maximum age of 30 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Patients who are 365-546 days of age with INRG Stage M and MYCN non-amplified NBL, irrespective of additional biologic features\n* Patients ≥ 547 days of age with INRG Stage L2, MYCN non-amplified NBL, regardless of additional biologic features\n* Patients with known bone marrow failure syndromes\n* Patients on chronic immunosuppressive medications (e.g., tacrolimus, cyclosporine, corticosteroids) for reasons other than prevention/treatment of allergic reactions and adrenal replacement therapy are not eligible. Topical and inhaled corticosteroids are acceptable\n* Patients with a primary immunodeficiency syndrome who require ongoing immune globulin replacement therapy\n* Female patients who are pregnant since fetal toxicities and teratogenic effects have been noted for several of the study drugs. A pregnancy test is required prior to enrollment for female patients of childbearing potential\n* Lactating females who plan to breastfeed their infants\n* Sexually active patients of reproductive potential who have not agreed to use an effective contraceptive method for the duration of their study participation\n* All patients and/or their parents or legal guardians must sign a written informed consent\n* All institutional, food and drug administration (FDA), and National Cancer Institute (NCI) requirements for human studies must be met",
