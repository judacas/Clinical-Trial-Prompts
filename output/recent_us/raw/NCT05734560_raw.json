Furthermore, subjects with a history of additional risk factors for torsades de pointes (e.g., long QT syndrome) are also excluded. Note: If a single ECG shows a QTcF with an absolute value > 500 ms, two additional ECGs at intervals of approximately 3 min must be performed within 30 min after the initial ECG, and the average of these three consecutive results for QTcF will be used to determine eligibility.\n\nCorrected QT (QTc) = QT / ∛RR QT: duration of QT interval RR: duration of RR interval\n\n* History of another primary cancer within the last 3 years with the exception of non-melanoma skin cancer, early-stage prostate cancer, or curatively treated cervical carcinoma in-situ.\n* Inability to comply with study and follow-up procedures as judged by the Investigator\n* Radiation therapy for bone metastasis within 2 weeks, any other radiation therapy within 4 weeks before first dose of study treatment.
