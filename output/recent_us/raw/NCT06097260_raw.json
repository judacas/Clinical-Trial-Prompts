Known antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS); or high-risk profile\n15. Malignancy within 5 years of screening, with the exception of basal and squamous cell carcinomas treated by complete excision. Subjects with cervical dysplasia that is cervical intraepithelial neoplasia but have been treated with conization or loop electrosurgical excision procedure and have had a normal repeat Papanicolaou test are allowed\n16. Prior cellular therapy\n17. Central nervous system (CNS) comorbidity or any autoimmune disease with CNS involvement within 90 days prior to the first dose of NKX019 as well as active CNS lupus within 1 year prior to screening",
