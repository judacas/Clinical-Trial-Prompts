must be relapsed/refractory OR ineligible to receive immunosuppressive therapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation\n\n  --Ineligibility to receive hematopoietic stem cell transplantation will include participants who are not anticipated to be candidates to receive transplantation within the next 3 months due to medical comorbidities, lack of appropriate donor, or logistical barriers to transplant\n* Participants with MDS/MPN must be relapsed/refractory (failed a minimum of 1 standard of care therapy) OR ineligible to receive standard of care OR without known life-prolonging therapy options OR have a diagnosis for which no known standard of care exists\n* Participants 12-17 years of age must weigh >= 35 kg\n* If any of the prior therapies noted below were given to the participant, they must have been completed within the following timeframes:\n\n  * 7 days from last dose of short-acting myeloid growth factors (i.e., filgrastim) and >= 14 days for long-acting (i.e., pegfilgrastim)\n  * 14 days from last dose of short-acting thrombopoietic growth factors (i.e.,eltrombopag) and >= 28 days for long-acting (i.e., romiplostim)\n  * 14 days or 5 pharmacokinetic half-lives from biological therapy agent\n  * 21 days from myelosuppressive chemotherapy\n  * 28 days from last dose of immunosuppressive therapy (e.g., ATG, cyclosporine, steroids greater than physiologic replacement)\n  * 28 days from last dose of lenalidomide\n  * 28 days from last dose of venetoclax\n  * 28 days from any other investigational agent\n  * 42 days from last dose of erythropoiesis stimulating agents\n  * 56 days from last dose of luspatercept\n  * 100 days from stem cell transplant with no evidence of active graft vs. host disease in participants who relapsed following transplant\n  * 150 days from total body irradiation\n* Performance status:\n\n  * For participants >= 16 years of age, ECOG performance status < 2 (Karnofsky >= 60%)\n  * For participants < 16 years of age, Lansky >= 60%\n* Participants must have adequate organ function as defined below:\n\n  * Total bilirubin: <= 1.5 X institutional upper limit of normal OR <= 3 x institutional upper limit of normal in participants with Gilbert s syndrome\n  * AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT): <= 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal\n  * Creatinine clearance: >= 50 mL/min/1.73 m^2 for participants with creatinine levels above institutional normal\n  * PT and PTT: <= 1.5 X institutional upper limit of normal, except in the setting of PTT elevation due to lupus anticoagulant, in which case these participants would be exempt from meeting this inclusion criterion\n* Individuals of child-bearing potential (IOCBP) and individuals able to father a child with a partner able to become pregnant must agree to use one (1) highly effective form of contraception (e.g., intrauterine device [IUD], surgical) or two (2) effective forms of contraception (e.g., barrier method) while on study drug and for 30 days after the last dose of study drug\n* Nursing participants must discontinue breastfeeding and/or not begin breastfeeding until 2 weeks after the last dose of study drug\n* Ability of participant or parent/guardian (for participants 12-17 only) to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\n* Participants with platelet transfusion-refractory thrombocytopenia, with inability to keep platelet threshold above 10 K/mcL with transfusions\n* Participants with evidence of ongoing hemorrhage, active signs/symptoms of bleeding, or history of severe (grade >= 3) unprovoked bleeding complications in the one year prior to enrollment, or any unprovoked grade 2 bleeding complications in the 3 months prior\n\nto enrollment\n\n* Use of anti-platelet or anticoagulant medication other than low-dose aspirin (100 mg daily or less) in the 14 days prior to enrollment, or any ongoing requirement for these medications\n* Participants who are unwilling to accept blood transfusions\n* Participants with ANC < 500 cells/mcL AND hospitalization for a fungal infection in the 12 months prior to enrollment\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to pacritinib\n* Concomitant administration with sensitive substrates/narrow therapeutic index drugs of CYP3A4, CYP1A2, P-gp BCRP, and OCT1 should be avoided. Concurrent use of strong inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 are not allowed. Prior use is allowed as long as medication is stopped two weeks prior to study drug initiation. Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be\n\ncounseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product.\n\n* Participants with the following cardiac conditions at screening:\n\n  * Symptomatic congestive heart failure\n  * Unstable angina pectoris\n  * Uncontrolled cardiac dysrhythmias\n  * QTc(F) prolongation >450 ms, or other factors that increase the risk for QT prolongation (i.e., heart failure, or a history of long QT interval syndrome)\n* Grade >= 3 cardiac complication in the 6 months prior to enrollment\n* Left ventricular ejection fraction <= 50% by transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) at screening\n* Participants with any active, uncontrolled viral, bacterial, or fungal infection, including active HIV-1, Hepatitis B (HBV) and/or Hepatitis C (HCV) infection (positive HBV or HCV viral load in the setting of positive HBV core antibody or surface antibody or HCV antibody); history of HIV, HBV, or HCV is allowed if there is no uncontrolled viral infection\n* Pregnancy\n* Presence of another known cause of cytopenia or dysplastic marrow that is untreated and may limit interpretation of results\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness or any significant disease, evaluated by history, physical exam and chemistries or social situations that may limit interpretation of results, limit compliance with study requirements, or that could increase risk to the participant\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 12 Years\nMust have maximum age of 120 Years",
