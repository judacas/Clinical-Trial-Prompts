Adequate bone marrow, liver, and renal function as assessed by the following laboratory requirements conducted within 7 days before starting study treatment:\n\n   1. Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dl\n   2. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1 x 10^9/L\n   3. Platelets ≥50 x 10^9/L (patient without BM involvement) and 30 x 10^9/L (patient with BM involvement)\n   4. Total bilirubin ≤1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN)\n   5. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤2.5 x ULN if known liver involvement\n   6. Creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL OR calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min (as calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault method)\n8.
