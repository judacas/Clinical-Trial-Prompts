    "official_title": "A Phase Ia/Ib, Open-label, Multicentre Dose-escalation and Expansion Study to Investigate the Safety, Pharmacokinetics and Preliminary Efficacy of BI 1823911 as a Monotherapy and in Combination With Other Anti-cancer Therapies in Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumours Expressing KRAS G12C Mutation",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Pathologically confirmed diagnosis of locally advanced or metastatic solid tumours, e.g. adenocarcinoma of the lung, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer or cholangiocarcinoma. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with mixed histology are eligible if adenocarcinoma is the predominant histology.\n* Documented disease progression despite appropriate prior standard therapies or for whom no standard therapy exists for their tumour type and disease stage.\n* KRAS mutation status: Kirsten rat sarcoma virus homolog (KRAS) glycine-to-cysteine (G12C) mutation in tumour tissue or blood based on previously performed local testing using a validated test.\n* Provision of archival tumour tissue, if available, to confirm retrospectively KRAS G12C mutation status and for biomarker assessment.\n* At least one target lesion that can be measured per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours (RECIST) version 1.1 (radiated lesions do not qualify as target lesions). In patients who only have one target lesion, and a biopsy of the lesion is required, the baseline imaging must be performed before the biopsy or at the earliest two weeks after the biopsy.\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.\n* Adequate organ function as follows:\n\n  * Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1.5 x 10^9/L (equivalent values: ≥ 1.5 x 10³/μL or ≥ 1500/mm³); hemoglobin ≥9.0 g/dL (equivalent values: ≥ 90 g/L or ≥ 5.6 mmol/L); platelets ≥100 x 10^9/L (equivalent values: ≥ 100 x 10³/μL or ≥ 100 x 10³/mm³) without the use of haematopoietic growth factors.\n  * Total bilirubin ≤1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), or ≤4 x ULN for patients who are known to have Gilbert's syndrome.\n  * Creatinine ≤1.5 x ULN. If creatinine is >1.5 x ULN, patient is eligible if concurrent creatinine clearance ≥50 mL/min (equivalent value: 0.84mL/s) (measured or calculated by Cockcroft-Gault formula).\n  * Aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) ≤3 x ULN, for patients with liver metastases ≤5 x ULN.\n* Age ≥18 years of age, or over the legal age of consent as required by local legislation.\n\nFurther inclusion criteria apply.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Previous anticancer chemotherapy within 3 weeks of the first administration of trial drug. Previous anticancer hormonal treatment or anticancer immunotherapy within 2 weeks of the first administration of trial drug.\n* Previous treatment with Rat Sarcoma (RAS), Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) or Son of sevenless 1 (SOS1) targeting agents (only for monotherapy Parts A, B, and C).\n* Radiotherapy within 2 weeks prior to start of treatment, provided recovery from related toxicity.\n* Major surgery (major according to the investigator's assessment) performed within 4 weeks prior to start of treatment or planned during the projected course of the trial, e.g. hip replacement.\n* Previous treatment with any investigational agent(s) or targeted treatment within 28 days prior to start of treatment or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter.\n* Known history of hypersensitivity to any of the excipients of BI 1823911 tablets, or any contraindication to Midazolam (for Monotherapy Part B only).\n* History or presence of cardiovascular abnormalities such as congestive heart failure New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification of ≥3, unstable angina or poorly controlled arrhythmia which are considered clinically relevant by the Investigator. Myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to start of treatment. Uncontrolled hypertension defined as: Blood pressure (BP) measured in a rested and relaxed condition, where systolic BP >=140 mmHg, or diastolic BP >= 90 mmHg, with or without medication.\n* Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <50%. Further exclusion criteria apply.",
