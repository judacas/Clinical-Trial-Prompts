    "exclusion_criteria": "* Chemotherapy, biological therapy, immunotherapy or investigational therapy within 14 days prior to day 1 of protocol therapy\n* Major surgery or radiation therapy within 28 days of study therapy\n* Has received a vaccination within 30 days of first study injection\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to study agent\n* Clinically significant uncontrolled illness\n* Active infection requiring antibiotics\n* Known history of immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\n* Patients with a known history of hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection who have active disease as evidenced by hepatitis (Hep) B surface antigen status or Hep C polymerase chain reaction (PCR) status obtained within 14 days of cycle 1, day 1\n* Another malignancy within 3 years, except non-melanomatous skin cancer\n* Females only: Pregnant or breastfeeding\n* Patients may not have clinically unstable brain metastases. Patients may be enrolled with a history of treated brain metastases that are clinically stable for >= 4 weeks prior to start of study treatment\n* Any other condition that would, in the Investigator's judgment, contraindicate the patient's participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns with clinical study procedures\n* Prospective participants who, in the opinion of the investigator, may not be able to comply with all study procedures (including compliance issues related to feasibility/logistics)",
