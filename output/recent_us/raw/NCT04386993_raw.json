    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Newly diagnosed histologically proven locoregional OCSCC without evidence of distant metastases and a clinically determined T-stage of 2-4,\n\n   OR\n\n   Recurrent or persistent histologically proven locoregional OCSCC that was initially treated with surgery alone, and a clinically determined recurrent T-stage of 2-4.\n\n   Note - OCSCC includes the subsites of oral tongue, floor of mouth, gingiva, retromolar trigone, and buccal mucosa.\n\n   Note - To allow sufficient tumor tissue for the immunological analyses, patients with T-stage 1 OCSCC will be excluded\n2. Greater than or equal to 18 years of age\n3. ECOG performance status of 0 or 1\n4. Screening labs must meet the following criteria and must be obtained within 14 days prior to registration:\n\n   * WBC > 2,000/µL\n   * Absolute Neutrophil Count >1,500/µL\n   * Platelets > 100 X 103/µL\n   * Hemoglobin > 9.0 g/dL\n   * Serum creatinine < 1.5 X ULN or CrCl > 40mL/min (if using the Cockcroft-Gault formula below):\n\n   Female CrCl = (140 - age in years) x weight in kg x 0.85 72 x serum creatinine in mg/dL Male CrCl = (140 - age in years) x weight in kg x 1.00 72 x serum creatinine in mg/dL\n   * AST/ALT ≤ 3 x ULN\n   * Total Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN (except subjects with Gilbert Syndrome, who can have total bilirubin < 3.0 mg/dL)\n5. Reproductive Status:\n\nWOCBP must use appropriate method(s) of contraception. WOCBP should use an adequate method to avoid pregnancy for 23 weeks (30 days plus the time required for nivolumab to undergo five half-lives) after the last dose of investigational drug.\n\nMen receiving nivolumab and who are sexually active with WOCBP will be instructed to adhere to contraception with a failure rate of less than 1% per year for a period of 31 weeks after the last dose of investigational product.\n\nWOCBP is defined as any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy) or who is not postmenopausal. Menopause is defined clinically as 12 consecutive months of amenorrhea in a woman over 45.\n\nWomen of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 24 hours prior to registration Women who are not of childbearing potential (i.e., who are postmenopausal or surgically sterile) and azoospermic men, are not required to use contraception.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",

History of pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease\n11. Active, known or suspected autoimmune disease. Note: Subjects are permitted to enroll if they have vitiligo, type I diabetes mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only requiring hormone replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger\n12. Presence of condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (> 10 mg daily prednisone or equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study drug administration. Inhaled or topical steroids and adrenal replacement doses > 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease",
