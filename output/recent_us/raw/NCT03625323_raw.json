Histologically or cytologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma, gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, gallbladder adenocarcinoma, ampullary carcinoma, adenocarcinoma of unclear primary (with upper GI primary suspected), or other primary GI malignancy for which the treating physician feels that I-FLOAT is a reasonable therapeutic option.\n2.

Creatinine = 1.5 mg/dL\n7. Measurable or non-measurable disease will be allowed.\n8. Women of childbearing potential and sexually active males must use an effective contraception method during treatment and for three months after completing treatment.\n9.
