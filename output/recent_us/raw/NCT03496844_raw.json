Current evidence of interstitial lung disease (ILD) or pneumonitis, or prior history of ILD or non-infectious pneumonitis requiring glucocorticoids.\n8. Continuous systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (>10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications within 28 days prior to Day 1.\n9. Active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in past 2 years\n10. Patients with adrenal / pituitary insufficiency\n11. History of documented congestive heart failure; unstable angina; poorly controlled hypertension; clinically significant valvular heart disease; high-risk uncontrolled arrhythmias (including sustained ventricular tachycardia); myocardial infarction, unstable angina, cerebrovascular accident, or transient ischemic attack within the last 6 months, or Canadian Cardiovascular Society angina class > 2\n12. History of allogeneic organ transplant, stem cell transplant, or bone marrow transplant\n13. Previous SARS-CoV-2 infection within 10 days for mild or asymptomatic infections or 20 days for severe/critical illness prior to first dose\n14. Requirement for treatment with strong cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers or inhibitors\n15. Presence of gastrointestinal condition, for example, malabsorption, that might affect the absorption of Investigational Product(s).\n16. Troponin I > ULN\n17. Uncontrolled hypertension\n18. Corrected QT interval by Fridericia (QTcF) ≥ 470 ms per the central mean average of triplicate electrocardiograms (ECGs)\n19.

Symptomatic uncontrolled central nervous system (CNS) disease requiring treatment with steroids or anti-seizure medications within 2 months prior to Day 1. However, subjects with brain metastases that have been previously treated and are stable based on imaging performed within 2 months of Day 1 following completion of any CNS-directed therapy are allowed\n21.

History of uncontrolled seizures, central nervous disorders, substance abuse disorder or psychiatric disability judged by the Investigator to be clinically significant and would interfere with cooperation with requirements of the study\n26. Active infection requiring systemic treatment at time of first dose\n27. Positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (HIV antibodies) or active hepatitis B (e.g., HbsAg reactive) or active hepatitis C (e.g., HCV ribonucleic acid [RNA] qualitative) infection with detectable viral load\n28.

Note: If the subject had major surgery, the subject must have recovered adequately from the procedure and/or any complications from the surgery prior to starting study intervention\n30. Prior or ongoing clinically significant illness, medical condition, surgical history, physical finding, or laboratory abnormality that, in the Investigator's opinion, could affect the safety of the subject or impair the assessment of study results\n31. Planned use of any of the prohibited concomitant medications",
