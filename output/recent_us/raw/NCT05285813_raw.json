Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 (Appendix 1).\n5. Tumor size > 1 cm to ≤ 3 cm assessed by ultrasound and clinically and radiographically node negative with no known metastatic disease.\n6. HER2+ BC as defined by American Society of Clinical Oncology-College of American Pathologists (ASCO-CAP) guidelines.31 Patients may have ER+ or ER- negative disease, as defined by ASCO-CAP guidelines.\n7. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) must be within institutional limits of normal as assessed by echocardiogram (ECHO) or multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan, documented within 4 weeks prior to first dose of study drug.\n8. Adequate normal organ and marrow function as defined below:\n\n   * Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL\n   * Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 109/L (≥ 1500 per mm3)\n   * Platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L (≥100,000 per mm3)\n   * Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN).

Mean QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) ≥ 470 ms.\n5. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, active peptic ulcer disease or gastritis, active bleeding diatheses, , or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements or compromise the ability of the patient to give written informed consent.\n6. Female patients who are pregnant, breast-feeding, or of reproductive potential who are not employing an effective method of birth control.\n7. Patients with uncontrolled seizures.\n8.

Known active Hepatitis B and/or Hepatitis C. Hepatitis testing is not required unless the patient has a history of Hepatitis B or C.\n11. Known to be HIV positive. HIV testing is not required for those patients who are not known to be positive.\n12. Total lifetime anthracycline load exceeding 360 mg/m2 doxorubicin or equivalent\n13.
