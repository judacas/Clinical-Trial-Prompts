LTB, defined as 4 to 7 RBC units per 16 weeks; or b. HTB, defined as ≥ 8 RBC units per 16 weeks; and c. For all participants: i. Only transfusion events for a pretransfusion Hgb < 10 g/dL are counted toward eligibility; ii. At least 1 transfusion event in each 8-week period and a minimum of 2 transfusion events separated by ≥ 7 days within the 16-week period immediately preceding randomization; and iii. No consecutive 56-day period can be RBC transfusion-free during the 16-week period immediately preceding randomization.\n* Refractory or intolerant to prior ESA treatment (discontinued ≥ 8 weeks before randomization), or unlikely to respond to ESA treatment, defined as follows:\n\n  a. Refractory to prior ESA treatment: documentation of nonresponse or a response that was no longer maintained with a prior ESA-containing regimen, either as a single agent or combination (e.g., with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF]); ESA regimen must have been either: i. Recombinant human EPO ≥ 40,000 IU/week for ≥ 8 doses or equivalent; or ii. Darbepoetin alpha ≥ 500 μg every 3 weeks for ≥ 4 doses or equivalent.\n\n  b. Intolerant to prior ESA treatment: documentation of discontinuation of a prior ESA-containing regimen, either as a single agent or combination (e.g., with G-CSF), at any time after introduction due to intolerance or an AE.\n\n  c. Unlikely to respond to ESA treatment: low chance of response to ESA based on an endogenous serum EPO level > 200 U/L.\n* Less than 5% blasts in an evaluable bone marrow aspirate collected at Screening, read by an independent central reader.\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 2\n* Females of childbearing potential and sexually active males must agree to use highly effective methods of contraception\n* In the opinion of the Investigator, the participant is able and willing to comply with the requirements of the protocol (e.g., all study procedures, return for follow-up visits).\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
