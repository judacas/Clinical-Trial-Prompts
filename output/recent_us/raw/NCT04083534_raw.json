    "inclusion_criteria": "* Diagnosis of recurrent, unresectable, or metastatic DDLPS\n\n  * The definition of recurrent disease is a patient with a primary tumor that has been successfully resected, but has recurred after primary surgery\n  * Any number of prior systemic therapies will be allowed\n* Age ≥ 18 years at the time of informed consent\n* Willing and able to provide written informed consent/assent for the trial\n* Willing to comply with treatment protocol\n* Adequate performance status: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status 0 or 1/Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) 70-100%\n* Presence of measurable disease per RECIST v1.1\n\n  o Target lesions must not be chosen from a previously irradiated field unless there has been radiographically and/or pathologically documented tumor progression\n* QTc ≤ 480 msec using Fredericia's QT correction formula\n* Adequate organ function determined within 2 weeks of treatment initiation, defined as follows:\n\n  * Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL\n  * Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm3 (1.0 x 109/L)\n  * Platelet count ≥ 75,000/mm3 (50 x 109/L)\n  * Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) OR direct bilirubin ≤ ULN for a patient with total bilirubin level > 1.5 x ULN\n  * Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 2.5 x ULN OR ≤ 5 x ULN for patients with liver metastases\n  * Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 x ULN OR ≤ 5 x ULN for patients with liver metastases\n  * Alkaline phosphatase < 5 x ULN\n  * Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN or a measured or calculated creatinine clearancea\n\n    ≥ 60 mL/min for a patient with creatinine levels > 1.5 x institutional ULN (Note: Creatinine clearance need not be determined if the baseline serum creatinine is within normal limits. GFR can also be used in place of creatinine or CrCl)\n  * International normalized ratio (INR) or prothrombin time (PT) ≤ 1.5 X ULN unless patient is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants\n  * Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) ≤ 1.5 x ULN unless subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT and PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants\n* For female patients of childbearing potential, negative serum pregnancy test at screening visit and within 72 h prior to the first dose of study medication\n\naCreatinine clearance should be calculated per institutional standard.\n\nContraception Requirements\n\nFemale participants of reproductive potential and male participants with female partners of reproductive potential are required to use highly effective contraceptive measures from the first dose of study treatment until 30 days after the last dose of etrumadenant or 90 days after the last dose of zimberelimab, whichever is longer.\n\n* A female participant (or female partner of a male participant) is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming post-menopausal unless permanently sterile.\n\n  * Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy and bilateral oophorectomy.\n  * A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a post-menopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient.\n* A man is considered fertile after puberty unless permanently sterile by bilateral orchidectomy\n\nHighly effective contraception is defined as use of one or more methods that result in a low failure rate (i.e., less than 1%). Highly effective contraceptive measures include:\n\n* Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation: oral, intravaginal, transdermal\n* Progestogen only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation: oral, injectable, implantable\n* Intrauterine device\n* Intrauterine hormone-releasing system in combination with a barrier method (preferably male condom)\n* Surgical sterilization\n\n  * Female participant or female partner of the male participant has undergone bilateral tubal ligation\n  * Male participant is vasectomized (with documented medical confirmation of surgical success) and is the sole sexual partner of a female with reproductive potential\n* Complete sexual abstinence defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with study treatment. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant\n\nTo ensure proper birth control, female participants who use hormonal contraception should use an efficient barrier contraceptive (condom plus spermicide). Additionally, male participants, when having sexual intercourse with a female of reproductive potential, should use an efficient barrier contraceptive (condom plus spermicide); the respective partner should also use an additional efficient contraceptive method (e.g., oral pills, intrauterine device, or diaphragm, and spermicide).\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
