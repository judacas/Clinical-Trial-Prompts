    "official_title": "A Phase Ib/II Study of the Safety and Pharmacology of Nilotinib to Prevent Paclitaxel-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy in Patients with Breast Cancer",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Men or Women with a known diagnosis of breast cancer stages I-III.\n* Be eligible for weekly or dose dense single agent paclitaxel therapy based on physician assessment.\n* Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =< 2\n\n  * Patients with ECOG scores of 3 or greater typically do not receive chemotherapeutic intervention.\n* Leukocytes >= 2,000/uL.\n* Absolute neutrophil count >= 1,500/uL.\n* Platelets >= 100,000/uL.\n* Total bilirubin =< upper limit of normal (ULN).\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT]) =< 2.5 x institutional upper limit of normal.\n* Creatinine within normal institutional limits OR >= 50 mL/min for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal.\n* Corrected QT interval (QTc) < 450 milliseconds.\n* If a female subject is with child bearing potential, she must have a negative pregnancy test at screening.\n* Female subjects of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation and for 3 months after completion of study treatment administration. Adequate contraception includes methods such as oral contraceptives, double barrier method (condom plus spermicide or diaphragm), or abstaining from sexual intercourse.\n* Be willing and able to understand and sign the written informed consent document.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Known distant metastatic disease.\n* Is HER2+ and is receiving paclitaxel in conjunction with trastuzumab +/- pertuzumab.\n* Has experienced > grade 1 neuropathy during previous therapies for early stage breast cancer.\n* Has experienced prior treatment-related toxicities that have not recovered to grade 1 or less (except for alopecia).\n* Has a history of grade 3-4 immediate hypersensitivity reaction to paclitaxel.\n* Has a history of clinically significant allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to nilotinib or paclitaxel.\n* Has uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* Is currently pregnant or breast feeding as there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with nilotinib and paclitaxel.\n* Has any other medical or psychiatric condition that in the opinion of the investigator would make the study therapy unsafe for the patient.\n* Has gastrointestinal (GI) disorders or impairment of GI function that is likely to significantly alter the absorption of nilotinib\n* Uses potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (grapefruit juice, cyclosporine, ketoconazole, ritonavir) and if treatment cannot be either safely discontinued or switched to a different medication prior to starting nilotinib.\n* Has a known diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and is currently taking combination antiretroviral therapy known or suspected to affect paclitaxel pharmacokinetics (PK).\n* Is concurrently using potent OATP1B1 inhibitors, including antibiotics (rifampicin, rifamycin SV, systemic fusidic acid, clarithromycin, erythromycin, roxithromycin, telithromycin), antiretrovirals (indinavir, saquinavir, ritonavir), cyclosporine, and gemfibrozil.",
