    "miscellaneous_criteria": "Subjects who are able and willing to give written informed consent\n\n* Documented primary or secondary AML, as defined by the WHO criteria (2008), by histopathology refractory to previous induction chemotherapy and/or relapsed after achieving remission with a prior chemotherapy and who are not candidates for other available therapy likely to confer clinical benefit.\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 2\n* In the absence of rapidly progressing disease, the interval from prior treatment to time of FF-10101-01 administration should be at least 14 days for cytotoxic agents other than hydroxyurea, at least 5 half-lives for non-cytotoxic agents, and 14 days for monoclonal antibody therapies.
