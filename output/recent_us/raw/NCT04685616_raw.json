    "exclusion_criteria": "* Diagnosed with Stage IV breast cancer\n* Uncontrolled blood pressure defined by SBP > 180mmHg on two or more occasions and taking three or more antihypertensives within 1 month prior to enrollment.\n* Baseline systolic blood pressure < 90mmHg within 1 month prior to enrollment (if multiple blood pressures are available in the medical record within 1 month prior to enrollment, the average SBP will be considered)\n* Women must not be pregnant or breast-feeding due to the potential harm to an unborn fetus and possible risk for adverse events in nursing infants with some anti-hypertensives, including angiotensin receptor blockers. All females of childbearing potential must have a blood test or urine study within 10 days prior to enrollment to rule out pregnancy.

Results of serum bilirubin, AST, and ALT must be checked for screening if no results available in the EMR within 28 days prior to enrollment.\n* end-stage renal failure on dialysis\n* hyperkalemia with a potassium > 5.5 mEq/l on most recent labs prior to enrollment. Serum potassium must be checked for screening if no results available in the EMR within 28 days prior to enrollment.\n* a history of kidney transplant\n* an eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73m2 at most recent check prior to enrollment. Creatinine must be checked for screening if no results available in the EMR within 28 days prior to enrollment\n* cardiogenic shock\n* decompensated heart failure requiring the use of IV inotropic therapy\n* Non-English speaking",
