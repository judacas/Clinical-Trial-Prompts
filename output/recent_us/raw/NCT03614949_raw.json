For the purposes of this trial, WOCBP are defined as women who have had a menstrual period within the last 48 months.\n* Provision of signed and dated informed consent form\n* Ability to take the study medication, and complete the study questionnaires\n* Stated willingness to comply with all study procedures for the duration of the study\n* For women of reproductive potential, agreement to use highly effective contraception during study treatment and for at least 4 months after the final dose\n* For men of reproductive potential, agreement to use condoms or other methods to ensure effective contraception with female partners of reproductive potential\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Autoimmune conditions requiring >10mg prednisone (or its equivalent) of daily therapy or other systemic immunosuppressive therapy.\n* Patients who are receiving other investigational agents\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements\n* Patients with known leptomeningeal disease for which CNS therapy is required\n* Pregnant or lactating patients",
