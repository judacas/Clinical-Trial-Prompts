For this reason and because ATR and PARP inhibitors as well as other therapeutic drugs used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use 2 highly effective forms of contraception prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.\n\n    1. Male patients who are sexually active must be willing to use barrier contraception for the duration of the study and for 1 week after the last study drug administration, with all sexual partners. Male patients must use a condom during treatment and for 6 months after the last dose of study drug(s) when having sexual intercourse with a pregnant woman or with a woman of childbearing potential. Female partners of male patients should also use a highly effective form of contraception for 6 months after the last dose of study drug(s) if they are of childbearing potential. True abstinence for either sex is an acceptable form of contraception and must be documented as such.\n    2. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 7 days prior to C1D1 treatment. Evidence of postmenopausal status or non-child bearing status must be documented.
