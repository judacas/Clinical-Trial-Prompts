    "inclusion_criteria": "* Participants must have histologically confirmed clinical stage II or III ERPR- HER2+ (per CAP criteria) invasive carcinoma of the breast\n* Medically and surgically appropriate to undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy with TCH-P Taxotere (docetaxel), Carboplatin, Herceptin (trastuzumab), Perjeta (pertuzumab) regimen followed by standard of care local therapy as determined by their treating physician\n* Age ≥18 years.\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status less than 2\n* Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:\n\n  * leukocytes ≥3,000/μL\n  * absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/μL\n  * platelets ≥100,000/μL\n  * total bilirubin within normal institutional limits\n  * AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) less than or equal to 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal\n  * creatinine within normal institutional limits - OR -\n  * creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m^2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal\n* Cardiac ejection fraction within institutional normal limits by either MUGA or ECHO at baseline.\n* Women of child-bearing potential and their male partners must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Sexually active male participants should use a barrier method or exercise abstinence during chemotherapy administration until surgery.\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Patients with inflammatory breast cancer, widespread locally advanced unresectable disease involving the chest wall/nodal basins in which a curative surgical resection cannot be performed, or those in whom de novo metastatic disease is suspected or confirmed\n* May not be receiving any other investigational agents for the treatment of their breast cancer.\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to the study vaccine components and any of the chemotherapy drugs (docetaxel, carboplatin, trastuzumab, pertuzumab)\n* Unwilling or unable to undergo an apheresis for production of their vaccine\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding\n* Known congenital or acquired immune deficiency (including those patients who require systemic immunosuppressant drugs for autoimmune disease or organ transplant).\n* Pre-existing peripheral neuropathy that would limit treatment with taxanes and platinum agents",
