Diagnosis of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) according to Rotterdam criteria: Infertility associated with chronic anovulation or oligomenorrhea, AND EITHER:\n\n   2.1. Ultrasonographic evidence of PCOS (ovarian volume ≥ 10ml and/or ovarian antral follicle count per ovary ≥ 20) OR 2.2. Evidence of hyperandrogenaemia: either clinical (hirsutism defined as mFG level ≥ 4-6 depending on ethnicity) or biochemical (raised serum concentration of androgens (testosterone ≥ 2.5nmol/l, or FAI > 4)\n3. At least one ovary with ovarian volume ≥ 10ml\n4. Ovarian accessibility: determined by ability to bring transvaginal ultrasound transducer into close proximity to ovaries\n5. Failure to respond to first-line pharmacological treatment or is contraindicated for or decline such treatment.\n6. At least one patent fallopian tube and normal uterine cavity as determined by sonohysterogram, hysterosalpingogram, or hysteroscopy/laparoscopy within the last 3 years\n7. Willing to comply with Clinical Investigation Plan-specified follow-up evaluation\n8. Ability to understand study requirements and has sufficient fluency in one of the IRB-approved written translation of the Patient Information and Informed consent form\n9. Signed informed consent\n10. Normal sperm parameters based on WHO 2010 criteria (concentration ≥ 15 million/mL, total motility ≥ 40%, normal morphology ≥ 4%) within the last year\n11. Ability to have regular vaginal intercourse during the study\n12. No previous sterilization procedures (vasectomy, tubal ligation) that have been reversed\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be FEMALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 40 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Current pregnancy\n2. Marked obesity, BMI > 40\n3. Marked hyperandrogenism (FAI > 15)\n4. Patient is currently participating in another investigational drug or device study that clinically interferes with the endpoints of this study\n5. Patient not willing to stop all concomitant first-line oral medications at least 6 weeks prior to study procedure and until the 3-month endpoint is reached, and all other forms of ovulation-induction treatment until the 6-month endpoint is reached\n6. Lack of capacity to give informed consent\n7. Lack of capacity to follow Clinical Investigation Plan and study requirements including all study follow-up visits\n8. Previous ovarian surgery: laparoscopic ovarian drilling, endometriosis surgery, ovarian cysts surgery\n9. Patient with known or suspected periovarian adhesions\n10. Transvaginal ultrasound transducer cannot be brought into proximity of both ovaries",
