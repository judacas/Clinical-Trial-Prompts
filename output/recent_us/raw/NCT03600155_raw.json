    "official_title": "A Phase 1 Pharmacokinetic Study of Oral Mobocertinib in Subjects With Severe Renal Impairment and Normal Renal Function",
    "inclusion_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria for Healthy Participants:\n\n1. Continuous non-smoker or moderate smoker (less than or equal to [<=] 10 cigarettes/day or the equivalent) before screening. Participant must agree to consume no more than 5 cigarettes or equivalent/day from the 7 days prior to mobocertinib dosing and throughout the period of PK sample collection.\n2. Body mass index (BMI) greater than or equal to (>=) 18.0 and <=39.0 kilogram per square meter (kg/m^2), at screening. Participants will be matched to RI participants by BMI (mean +- 10%) at screening. At least 50% of the participants will be required to be of BMI >=18.0 and <=35.0 kg/m^2, at screening.\n3. Medically healthy with no clinically significant medical history, physical examination, laboratory profiles, vital signs or ECGs, as deemed by the Investigator or designee. Has liver function tests including alanine aminotransferase (ALT), Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST), Alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and total bilirubin within the upper limit of normal at screening and at check-in.\n4. Baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) >=90 milliliter per minute per 1.73 square meter (mL/min/1.73 m^2) based on the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation at screening divided by standard body surface area (BSA) value of 1.73 m^2. For participants with non-standard BSA, the eGFR value calculated by MDRD formula will be multiplied by the individual's BSA calculated using appropriate formula and divided by 1.73 m^2.\n\nInclusion Criteria for Participants with RI:\n\n1. Continuous non-smoker or moderate smoker (<=10 cigarettes/day or the equivalent) before screening. Participant must agree to consume no more than 5 cigarettes or equivalent/day from the 7 days prior to dose of mobocertinib and throughout the period of PK sample collection.\n2. BMI >=18.0 and <=39.0 kg/m^2, at screening. At least 50% of the participants will be required to be of BMI >=18.0 and <=35.0 kg/m^2, at screening.\n3. Aside from RI, be sufficiently healthy for study participation based upon medical history, physical examination, vital signs, ECGs, and screening clinical laboratory profiles, as deemed by the Investigator or designee.\n4. Baseline eGFR 15-29 milliliter (mL) not on dialysis based on the MDRD equation at screening divided by standard BSA value of 1.73 m^2. For participants with non-standard BSA, the eGFR value calculated by MDRD formula will be multiplied by the individual's BSA calculated using appropriate formula and divided by 1.73 m^2.\n5. Has a diagnosis of chronic (greater than [>] 6 months), stable (no significant changes in renal function [less than [<] 30%] in the 30 days preceding screening; no acute episodes of illness within the previous 2 months due to deterioration in renal function) renal insufficiency. Participants with RI may have related medical conditions consistent with their disease (example, mild diabetes) that are stable for at least 3 months prior to screening, in the opinion of the Investigator or designee.\n\nExclusion Criteria\n\n1. Positive results at screening for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), or hepatitis C virus (HCV).\n2. Positive test result for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) testing at screening or check-in.\n3. Seated heart rate is lower than 40 beats per minute (bpm) or higher than 99 bpm at screening.\n4. Seated blood pressure is less than 90/40 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) or greater than 180/100 mmHg at screening.\n5. Healthy participants: QT interval with Fridericia's correction (QTcF) interval is >=450 millisecond (msec) in males or >=470 msec in females or has ECG findings deemed abnormal with clinical significance by the Investigator or designee at screening\n6. RI participants: QTcF interval is >500 msec or has ECG findings deemed abnormal with clinical significance by the Investigator or designee at screening.\n7. Unable to refrain from or anticipates the use of any medication or substance (including prescription or over-the-counter, vitamin supplements, natural or herbal supplements) as indicated in (Prohibitions and Concomitant Medication) for the prohibited time period.\n8. Been on a diet incompatible with the on-study diet, in the opinion of the Investigator or designee, within the 30 days prior to dosing and throughout the study.\n9. Donation of blood or significant blood loss within 56 days prior to dosing.\n10. Plasma donation within 7 days prior to dosing.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 81 Years",
