    "exclusion_criteria": "* Patient has a history of non-compliance to medical regimen or inability to grant consent\n* Patient is concurrently using other approved or investigational antineoplastic agent with the exception of BTK or Pi3K inhibitors in patients who had these agents as the last line of treatment\n\n  °Patient on BTK or P13K inhibitors will be continued on therapy as they transition to protocol therapy\n* Patient has not recovered to Grade 1 or better (except alopecia) from related side effects of any prior antineoplastic therapy\n* Patient has had major surgery or a wound that has not fully healed within 4 weeks of starting study drugs.\n* Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 2 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 2 weeks earlier.\n* Patients who have undergone an allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant\n* Patient has active or history of central nervous system (CNS) disease or meningeal involvement.\n* Patient has history of clinically significant interstitial lung disease and/or lung disease that severely impairs lung function (as judged by the investigator)\n* Patient has history of stroke or intracranial hemorrhage ≤ 6 months from starting study drugs.\n* Patient has impairment of gastrointestinal (GI) function or GI disease that may significantly alter the absorption of study drug (e.g., ulcerative diseases, uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome, or small bowel resection)\n* Patient has clinically significant cardiovascular disease such as uncontrolled or symptomatic arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, or myocardial infarction within 6 months of Screening, or any Class 3 (moderate) or Class 4 (severe) cardiac disease as defined by the New York Heart Association Functional Classification, Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) <50% as determined by Multiple Gated acquisition (MUGA) scan or echocardiogram (ECHO), unstable angina pectoris, symptomatic pericarditis, QTcF > 480 msec on the screening ECG (using the QTcF formula)\n* Patient has a concurrent active malignancy. Malignancies treated with a curative intent with an expected life expectancy ≥ 5 years or a non-competing life expectancy risk are eligible (i.e. adequately treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma, non-melanomatous skin cancer, early stage breast cancer, treated prostate cancer or any other cancer from which the patient has been disease free for ≥ 3 years).\n* Patient with known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or any uncontrolled active systemic infection.\n* Patient has CMV viremia (peripheral blood CMV PCR positive), acute viral hepatitis (typically defined by elevated AST/ALT), or a history of chronic or active HBV or HCV infection. HBV infection is defined as having HBsAg and/or HBcAb positive test with concurrent detectable HBV DNA levels. HCV infection is defined as detectable HCV RNA levels.\n* Patient requires treatment with a strong or moderate cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitors, and inducers, and the treatment cannot be discontinued or switched to a different medication prior to starting study drug. Moderate and strong CYP modulators (inducers and inhibitors) should have a washout period of at least 5-6 half-lives before initiating ibrutinib or copanlisib.\n* Patients with known bleeding diathesis (e.g. von Willebrand 's disease) or hemophilia\n* Patient is currently receiving warfarin or other Vitamin K antagonist. Therapy with heparin, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), or fondaparinux is allowed. Refer to Section 9.5 for Concomitant medication\n* Patients with Child Pugh Class B or C hepatic cirrhosis\n* Patients with any life threatening illness, medical condition or organ system dysfunction that in the opinion of the investigator could compromise the subject's safety, interfere with absorption of metabolism of study drugs or put the study outcomes at undue risk.",
