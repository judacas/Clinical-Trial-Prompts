Enrollment will be considered if HIV is controlled with treatment (i.e., undetectable viral load for 6 months prior and the CD4 counts is ≥ 200/µL). Such patients must be willing to modify HIV therapy while on-treatment and during applicable wash-out periods, as needed, to address drug-drug interactions\n* Willing and able to participate in all required evaluations and procedures in this protocol including swallowing capsules without difficulty\n* Persons of childbearing potential (PCBP): Persons of childbearing potential must have a negative serum (beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [b-hCG]) or urine pregnancy test at Screening and be willing to use approved contraception while on treatment and for the longest following, applicable time period: 18 months after the last dose of obinutuzumab, 2 months after the last dose of glofitamab, 3 months for tocilizumab, or 1 month after the last dose of ibrutinib. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding are ineligible for this study\n* Persons that produce viable sperm: Willingness to use approved contraception while on-treatment and for the longest applicable time period following: 6 months after the last dose of obinutuzumab or 2 months after the last dose of glofitamab, tocilizumab, or ibrutinib\n* Willingness to not breastfeed or donate ova or sperm: If obinutuzumab was the last study drug received, the participant must wait for 6 months. Otherwise, patients must agree to wait 3 months for sperm and 1 month for ova donations (and to breastfeed) after the last dose other study drugs\n* The effects of GLIB on the developing human fetus are unknown.
