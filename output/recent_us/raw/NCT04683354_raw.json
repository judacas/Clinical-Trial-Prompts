    "exclusion_criteria": "* PSA > 150 ng/mL\n* Definitive clinical or radiologic evidence of metastatic disease\n* Pathologically positive lymph nodes or nodes > 1.5 cm short axis on CT or MR imaging\n* Prior radical prostatectomy, cryosurgery for prostate cancer, or bilateral orchiectomy for any reason\n* Any active malignancy within 2 years of study registration that may alter the course of prostate cancer treatment\n* Prior systemic therapy for prostate cancer; note that prior therapy for a different cancer is allowable\n* Prior radiotherapy, including brachytherapy, to the region of the prostate that would result in overlap of radiation therapy fields\n* Current treatment with first generation anti-androgens (bicalutamide, nilutamide, flutamide). For patients enrolled to phase II, if prior anti-androgens were administered, a washout period of >= 30 days is required prior to enrollment\n* Severe, active co-morbidity, defined as follows:\n\n  * Unstable angina and/or congestive heart failure requiring hospitalization within the last 6 months\n  * Transmural myocardial infarction within the last 6 months\n  * Acute bacterial or fungal infection requiring intravenous antibiotics at the time of registration\n  * Uncontrolled acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) based upon current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) definition\n  * Presence of uncontrolled hypertension (persistent systolic blood pressure [BP] >=160 mmHg or diastolic BP >= 100 mmHg).

Patients receiving treatment with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) will not be eligible due to concern for radiosensitization\n  * Note also that HIV testing is not required for eligibility for this protocol. This exclusion criterion is necessary because the treatments involved in this protocol may be affected by these drugs\n* Any history or current diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/acute myeloid leukemia (AML)\n* Prior or current treatment with PARP inhibitor",
