Patients who have measurable or evaluable disease by RECIST 1.1 criteria, as assessed by the Investigator/local radiologist.\n\n    Inclusion Criteria for Dose Expansion Patients\n12. All patients must have a histological diagnosis of an advanced, unresectable, locally recurrent, or metastatic disease with no available therapy known to confer clinical benefit, as evaluated by the treating physician. There is no upper limit on the number of prior lines of anticancer therapy received.\n13. Patients must be enrolled in 1 of the following 4 dose expansion cohorts:\n\n    1. Cohort 1: Molecularly confirmed NRASmut CRC as determined by local test results\n    2. Cohort 2: Molecularly confirmed NRASmut malignant melanoma as determined by local test results\n    3. Cohort 3 Molecularly confirmed KRASmut NSCLC as determined by local test results\n    4.

Patients must have ≥ 1 measurable lesion per RECIST 1.1 criteria as assessed by the Investigator/local radiologist. Lesions situated in a previously irradiated area are considered measurable if progression has been demonstrated in such lesions.

    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Patients with any active central nervous system (CNS) lesion either symptomatic or radiologically unstable and/or leptomeningeal metastasis.
