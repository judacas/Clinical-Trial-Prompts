    "official_title": "A Prospective, Randomized Controlled Trial Evaluating the Efficacy of Amiodarone in the Prevention of Postoperative Atrial Fibrillation in Patients Undergoing Minimally Invasive Esophagectomy",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* All patients undergoing MIE will be evaluated for potential enrollment\n\n  * Indication of cancer, esophageal dysplasia or esophageal dysmotilities\n* Age > 18 years\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* History of chronic or paroxysmal AF, or atrial flutter\n* Previous severe adverse reaction or contraindication to amiodarone (e.g., pulmonary toxicity/fibrosis, hepatotoxicity, thyroid dysfunction)\n* Current preoperative use of amiodarone, as baseline home medication\n* Development of AF intraoperatively\n* Pregnancy\n\n  * Negative pregnancy tests are required for participants of childbearing potential (PCBP) on Day of Surgery (DOS)\n* Breastfeeding/chest feeding\n* Aborted MIE operation\n* QTcF (Fridericia formula) > 500 for heart rate (HR) 60-100 within 30 days\n\n  * For patients with a heart rate (HR) of between 50-59 on their pre-operative screening electrocardiography (EKG), we will first review evidence of chronotropic cardiac response to exercise before inclusion in the study. If a patient's HR increases to ≥ 100 with exercise, the patient is eligible for inclusion of study. Exercise testing options may include a stair climb, a brisk walk, or supine leg-lifts prior to surgery. If exercise is not an option, we can review results of formal stress testing chronotropic response (ie. HR ≥ 100). HR monitoring can be collected by either pulse oximeter or EKG",
