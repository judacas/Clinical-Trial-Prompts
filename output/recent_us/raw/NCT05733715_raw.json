Patients with MDS with no circulating blasts and with < 10% blasts in the bone marrow (higher blast percentage allowed in MDS due to lack of differences in outcomes with < 5% or 5-10% blasts in MDS.)

Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or other leukemias (including prolymphocytic leukemia) with chemosensitive disease at time of transplantation\n   4. Higher risk CMML according to CMML-specific prognostic scoring system or high risk MDS/MPN not otherwise specified are eligible, provided there is no evidence of high-grade bone marrow fibrosis or massive splenomegaly at the time of enrollment.\n   5. Patients with lymphoma with chemosensitive disease at the time of transplantation\n8.
