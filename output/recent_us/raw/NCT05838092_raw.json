    "exclusion_criteria": "The main exclusion criteria include but are not limited to the following:\n\n* Has not recovered to common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE) Grade 1 or better from any adverse events that were due to cancer therapeutics administered more than 4 weeks earlier.
