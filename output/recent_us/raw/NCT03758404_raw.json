Patients who have received:\n\n   1. prior cellular therapy such as (CAR T, TCR, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes) within one year.\n   2. organ transplantation.\n   3. previous anti-claudin18.2 CAR T-cell therapy, mRNA-based cancer immunotherapy, or bispecific T cell engager.\n8. Untreated central nervous system (CNS) metastatic disease, leptomeningeal disease, or cord compression;\n9. Patients with heavy tumor burdens;\n10. Unstable/active ulcer, anastomotic recurrence with full-thickness tumor infiltration or tumor involving any major vessels, digestive tract bleeding, or recent digestive surgery that may have increased risk of bleeding*;\n11. Patients who have a history of esophageal or gastric resection plus current evidence of locally recurrent tumor that involves any major blood vessels or that has evidence of recent bleeding or perforation*;\n12. Patients requiring anticoagulant therapy such as warfarin or heparin;\n13. Patients requiring long-term antiplatelet therapy;\n14. Use of prednisone >/= 10mg daily or other equivalent steroids within 14 days before leukapheresis or preconditioning*;\n15. Anticancer treatment within approximately 2 weeks prior to leukapheresis or preconditioning*;\n16. Major surgery less than 1 week prior to leukapheresis or 3 weeks prior to preconditioning*;\n17.

Subjects who have received a live attenuated vaccine 4 weeks before preconditioning.\n\nInclusion Criteria Before Infusion: There are no inclusion criteria at this timepoint.\n\nExclusion Criteria Before Infusion:\n\n1. Patients who have clinically significant cardiac conditions that researchers believe that participating in this clinical trial may endanger the health of the patients;\n2. Inadequate pulmonary function;\n3. Active infection requiring systemic therapy or causing fever within 7 days prior to investigational infusion;\n4. Active illness or toxicity that would place the subject at undue risk;\n5. Abrupt deterioration of clinical status or condition;\n6. New or worsening Grade ≥ 3 non-hematologic toxicities.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 76 Years",
