    "official_title": "Phase 2 Study BRIDGING PRE-TRANSPLANT INFLAMMATORY DAMPENING for PRIMARY IMMUNE REGULATORY DISORDERS (BRIDGE Trial)",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Patients receiving first allo-HCT for the following immunologic conditions:\n* Primary Immune Regulatory Disorder with or without a genetic lesion as defined by the Primary Immune Deficiency Treatment Consortium (PIDTC)\n* Patients with autoinflammatory disorders evidenced by cytokine or inflammation assays with at least 1.5x ULN of measured cytokines and/or an elevated ferritin or ESR > 2 ULN\n* For inclusion on the emapalumab group, the lesion must be isolated to the IFNγ pathway (or mediators thereof) with an elevated CXCL9 >1.5 ULN OR sIL2R >1.5 ULN (or already controlled on immune modulation, provided that CXCL9 or sIL2R levels were elevated prior to initiation of immune modulation). Inclusion on the Fludarabine/dexamethasone group requires inflammation (as defined above) other than an isolated IFNγ pathway\n* Able to tolerate cytoreduction (based on adequate organ function as described below)\n* Patients of any age can enroll so long as they meet other inclusion criteria:\n* Adequate organ function is required, defined as follows:\n\n  * Hepatic: Serum bilirubin ≤ 2 mg/dL, unless benign congenital hyperbilirubinemia. Patients with hyperbilirubinemia related to paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria or other hemolytic disorders related to their PIRD diagnosis are eligible.\n  * Hepatic: AST, ALT, and alkaline phosphatase < 2.5 times the upper limit of normal unless thought to be disease-related. Investigator will need to perform clinically indicated evaluations to assess if disease related or intrinsic liver disease. Additional testing may be done if clinically indicated, after the pre-transplant immune prophase and prior to start of conditioning as this will provide additional data to confirm disease related versus intrinsic liver dysfunction.\n  * Renal: serum creatinine <1.5x normal for age. If serum creatinine is outside the normal range, then CrCl > 50 mL/min/1.73m2 (calculated or estimated) or GFR (mL/min/1.72m2) >30% of predicted normal for age.\n  * Normal GFR by Age\n  * Cardiac: LVEF ≥ 50% by MUGA or resting echocardiogram.\n  * Pulmonary: Pulmonary function testing (FEV1 and corrected DLCO) ≥ 50% predicted (pediatric patients unable to complete PFTs will need oxygen saturation as recorded by pulse oximetry of ≥92% on room air).\n* Adequate performance status:\n\n  * Age ≥ 16 years: ECOG ≤ 1 or Karnofsky 70%\n  * Age < 16 years: Lansky 70%\n* Each patient must be willing to participate as a research subject and must sign an informed consent form or legal guardian with assent as appropriate.\nHealthy volunteers allowed",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Uncontrolled infection at the time of enrollment.\n* Patients who have undergone previous allo-HCT.\n* Patient seropositivity for HIV I/II and/or HTLV I/II.\n* Females who are pregnant or breastfeeding.\n* Patients unwilling to use contraception during the study period.\n* Patient or parent or guardian unable to give informed consent or unable to comply with the treatment protocol including research tests.\n\nDonor Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Related Donors:\n\n  * 8/8 or 7/8 HLA matched at A, B, C, and DRB1 loci, as tested by DNA analysis.\n  * Haploidentical donors at A, B, C and DRB1 loci, as tested by DNA analysis\n* Unrelated Donors:\n\n  o 8/8 or 7/8 matched at A, B, C, and DRB1 loci, as tested by DNA analysis.\n* Able to provide informed consent for the donation process per institutional standards.\n* Meet standard criteria for donor collection (e.g. National Marrow Donor Program Guidelines or collecting center guidelines as approved by treating physician).",
