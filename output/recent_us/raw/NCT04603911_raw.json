    "official_title": "A Randomized, Double-Blind, Phase 3 Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Vedolizumab Intravenous As Maintenance Therapy in Pediatric Subjects with Moderately to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis Who Achieved Clinical Response Following Open-Label Vedolizumab Intravenous Therapy",
    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Has moderately to severely active UC, unresponsive or intolerant to their current standard of care (SOC).\n2. Weighs ≥10 kg at the time of screening and enrollment into the study.\n3. Participants with UC diagnosed at least 1 month before screening. Participants with moderately to severely active UC based on a modified Mayo score of 5 to 9 (sum of Mayo endoscopic subscore, stool frequency subscore, and rectal bleeding subscore) with a Mayo endoscopic subscore of ≥2 (with the presence of mucosal friability excluding an endoscopic subscore of 1 and mandating a score of at least 2) at screening endoscopy.\n4. Has failed, lost response to, or been intolerant to treatment with at least 1 of the following agents: corticosteroids (eg, azathioprine [AZA], 6-mercaptopurine [6-MP], methotrexate [MTX]), immunomodulators, and/or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) antagonist therapy (eg, infliximab, adalimumab). This includes participants who are dependent on corticosteroids to control symptoms and who are experiencing worsening of disease in the moderate-to-severe range when attempting to wean off corticosteroids.\n5. Has evidence of UC extending proximal to the rectum (i.e., not limited to proctitis), at a minimum.\n6. Has extensive colitis or pancolitis of >8 years' duration or left-sided colitis of >12 years' duration must have documented evidence of a negative surveillance colonoscopy within 12 months before screening.\n7. Participants with vaccinations that are up-to-date based on the countrywide, accepted schedule of childhood vaccines.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 2 Years\nMust have maximum age of 17 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Has previous exposure to approved or investigational anti-integrins including, but not limited to natalizumab, efalizumab, etrolizumab, or Abrilumab (AMG 181), or mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1) antagonists or rituximab.\n2. Has received an investigational biologic within 60 days or 5 half-lives before screening (whichever is longer); or an approved biologic or biosimilar agent within 2 weeks before the first dose of study drug or at any time during the screening period.\n3. Has active cerebral/meningeal disease, signs/symptoms or history of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) or any other major neurological disorders including stroke, multiple sclerosis, brain tumor or neurodegenerative disease.\n4. Has had clinically significant infection (eg, pneumonia, pyelonephritis, coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]) within 30 days prior to first dose of study drug.\n5. Has received any live vaccinations within 30 days prior to first dose of study drug.\n6. Participants who currently require surgical intervention or are anticipated to require surgical intervention for UC during this study.\n7. Has had subtotal or total colectomy or have a jejunostomy, ileostomy, colostomy, ileo-anal pouch, or known fixed stenosis of the intestine.\n8. Participants with a current diagnosis of indeterminate colitis.\n9. Participants with clinical features suggesting monogenic very early onset inflammatory bowel disease.\n10. Participant with active or latent tuberculosis (TB), as evidenced by a diagnostic TB test performed within 30 days of screening or during the screening period that is positive, defined as:\n\n    * Positive QuantiFERON test or 2 successive indeterminate QuantiFERON tests, OR\n    * A TB skin test reaction ≥5 mm. NOTE: If participants have received Bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine then a QuantiFERON TB Gold test should be performed instead of the TB skin test.\n11. Participants with evidence of positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb). Hepatitis B virus (HBV) immune participants (ie, hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]-negative and hepatitis B antibody-positive) may, however, be included. Note: If a participant tests negative for HBsAg, but positive for HBcAb, the participant would be considered eligible if the absence of HBV DNA is confirmed by HBV DNA polymerase chain reaction reflex testing performed in the central laboratory.\n\n    Participants with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) (ie, positive HCV antibody [HCVAb] and HCV RNA). Note: Subjects who are HCVAb-positive without evidence of HCV RNA may be considered eligible (spontaneous viral clearance or previously treated and cured [defined as no evidence of HCV RNA at least 12 weeks before baseline]).\n12. The participant has evidence of dysplasia or history of malignancy other than a successfully treated nonmetastatic cutaneous squamous cell or basal cell carcinoma or localized carcinoma in situ of the cervix.\n13. Has positive stool studies for ova and/or parasites or stool culture at screening visit.\n14. Has positive Clostridioides difficile (C difficile) stool test at screening visit.\n\nOther inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.",
