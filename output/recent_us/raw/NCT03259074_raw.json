    "inclusion_criteria": "* Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of =< 2\n* Suspicion of gynecological malignancy that requires a standard of care surgical resection in the operating room;\n* Have measurable lesion in the pelvis or abdomen, at a minimum of 0.5 cm in diameter on standard of care pre operative imaging studies (CT, MRI or PET scan),\n* Subject or legal representative must understand the investigational nature of this study and sign an Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board approved written informed consent form prior to receiving any study related procedure\n* Serum Creatinine <= 1.5 X upper limit of normal (ULN) OR measured or calculated creatinine clearance â‰¥ 60 mL/min for participant with creatinine levels > 1.5 X institutional ULN (using Cockcroft-Gault Equation), GFR can also be used in place of creatinine or CrCl.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be FEMALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements\n* Any known allergy or prior reaction to fluorescein\n* Nursing female subjects\n* Liver dysfunction; normal liver function defined as total bilirubin within normal institutional limits and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT]) =< 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal\n* Any condition which in the Investigator's opinion deems the subject an unsuitable candidate to undergo observational study (may also include preoperative testing results including electrocardiography (EKG), chest x-ray, or pulmonary function tests that preclude a wide excision in the operating room)",
