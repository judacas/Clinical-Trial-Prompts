    "official_title": "A Phase II Trial Comparing Quality of Life After HIPEC in Patients With Stage IIIC and IV Ovarian, Fallopian Tube or Primary Peritoneal Carcinoma",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed non-mucinous, epithelial stage 3 or 4 carcinoma of the ovary, fallopian tube or peritoneum.\n* Patients must not have received treatment for another malignancy within 3 years of enrollment (patients who have received hormone therapy within 3 years of enrollment are still eligible).\n* Patients must have received at least 3 but not more than 6 cycles of carboplatin-doublet based IV neoadjuvant chemotherapy and achieved at least stable disease (radiographically confirmed) at the conclusion of this therapy.\n* Age â‰¥ 18 years.\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =< 2\n* Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined below (within 30 days of registration):\n* Absolute neutrophil count >= 1,500/mcL (within 30 days of registration)\n* Platelets >= 75,000/mcL (within 30 days of registration)\n* Total bilirubin =< 1.5 mg/dL (within 30 days of registration)\n* Creatinine clearance >= 50 mg/dL (within 30 days of registration)\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase [SGPT]) =< 3 x institutional upper limit of normal (within 30 days of registration)\n* Alkaline phosphatase =< 3 x institutional upper limit of normal (within 30 days of registration)\n* The effects of HIPEC on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, and because carboplatin doublet therapy consists of pregnancy category D agents, women of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign an institutional review board (IRB)-approved informed consent document.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be FEMALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.\n* Patients with extra-abdominal metastatic disease.\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to carboplatin doublet agents.\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because carboplatin doublet therapy consists of pregnancy category D agents with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with carboplatin doublet therapy, breastfeeding should be discontinued.\n* Men are excluded from participating due to the site specific nature of the disease being studied.",
