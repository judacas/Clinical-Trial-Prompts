Patients must have received ≤ 3 prior lines of therapy for metastatic disease\n2. Patient has evaluable disease by RECIST v1.1\n3. Patient has a performance status (PS) of 0-2 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale\n4. Patient is at least 21 days (12 weeks for glioblastoma patients) removed from therapeutic radiation or chemotherapy prior to the first scheduled day of dosing with VT1021\n5. Patient has adequate organ function\n6. Patient agrees to use acceptable methods of contraception during the study and 60 days after the last dose of VT1021\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Diagnosis of another malignancy within the past 2 years (excluding a history of carcinoma in situ of the cervix, superficial non-melanoma skin cancer, superficial bladder cancer, or endometrial cancer that has been adequately treated, or stage 1 prostate cancer that does not require treatment)\n2. History of a major surgical procedure or a significant traumatic injury within 14 days prior to commencing treatment, or the anticipation of the need for a major surgical procedure during the course of the study\n3. Treatment with investigational therapy(ies) within 5 half-lives of the investigational therapy prior to the first scheduled day of dosing with VT1021, or 4 weeks if the half-life of the investigational agent is not known\n4. Concurrent serious (as determined by the Principal Investigator) medical conditions, including, but not limited to, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV congestive heart failure, history of congenital prolonged QT syndrome, uncontrolled infection, active hepatitis B, hepatitis C or HIV, or other significant co-morbid conditions that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would impair study participation or cooperation\n5. Pregnancy or lactation\n6. Evidence of symptomatic brain metastases. Patients with treated (surgically excised or irradiated) and stable brain metastases are eligible, assuming the patient has adequately recovered from treatment\n7. Other concurrent chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy or investigational therapy\n8.
