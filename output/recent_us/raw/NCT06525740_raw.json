    "official_title": "A Proof of Concept Pilot Trial of Alpha-1-Antitrypsin for Pre-Emption Of Steroid-Refractory Acute GVHD",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* High risk prediction score as determined by the Mount Sinai Acute GVHD International Consortium (MAGIC) algorithm at either day 7 or day 14 post Hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT).\n* Any donor type (e.g., related, unrelated) or stem cell source (bone marrow, peripheral blood, cord blood).\n* Donor and recipient match each other for at least 7/8 HLA-loci (HLA-A, B, C, and DR)\n* Any conditioning regimen (non-myeloablative, myeloablative, or reduced intensity) is acceptable.\n* GVHD prophylaxis must include a calcineurin inhibitor combined with methotrexate or mycophenolate.\n* The use of serotherapy to prevent GVHD (e.g., antithymocyte globulin) prior to day 3 post-HCT is permitted\n* Direct bilirubin must be <2 mg/dL unless the elevation is known to be due to Gilbert syndrome within 3 days prior to enrollment.\n* ALT/SGPT and AST/SGOT must be <5 x the upper limit of the normal range within 3 days prior to enrollment.\n* Signed and dated written informed consent obtained from patient or legal representative.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Patients who develop acute GVHD prior to start of study drug\n* Patients at very high risk for relapse post HCT as defined by very high disease risk index\n* Patients participating in a clinical trial where prevention of GVHD is the primary endpoint\n* Uncontrolled active infection (i.e., progressive symptoms related to infection despite treatment or persistently positive microbiological cultures despite treatment or any other evidence of severe sepsis)\n* Patients who are pregnant\n* Patients on dialysis within 7 days of enrollment\n* Patients requiring ventilator support or oxygen supplementation exceeding 40% FiO2 within 14 days of enrollment.\n* Patients receiving investigational agent within 30 days of enrollment. However, the Principal Investigator (PI) may approve prior use of an investigational agent if the agent is not expected to interfere with the safety or the efficacy of alpha-1-antitrypsin.\n* History of allergic reaction to alpha-1-antitrypsin",
