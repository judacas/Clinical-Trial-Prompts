    "exclusion_criteria": "* Prior treatment with immunotherapy for cancer\n* Known metastatic disease\n* Known invasive cancer in contralateral breast\n* Patients with a previous history of non-breast malignancy are eligible only if they meet the following criteria for a cancer survivor:\n\n  * Has undergone potentially curative therapy for all prior malignancies AND\n  * Has been considered disease-free for at least 1 year (with the exception of basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma-in-situ of the cervix.\n* Currently receiving any other investigational agents.\n* A history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to paclitaxel, carboplatin, nivolumab, or other agents used in the study. Patients who have received multiple blood transfusions.\n* Evidence of uncontrolled ongoing or active infection, requiring parenteral anti-bacterial, anti-viral, or anti-fungal therapy ≤ 7 days prior to administration of study treatment. Patients receiving prophylactic antibiotics (e.g., for prevention of a urinary tract infection or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) are eligible.\n* Patients with prior allogeneic bone marrow transplantation or prior solid organ transplantation.\n* History or risk of autoimmune disease, including, but not limited to, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), vascular thrombosis associated with antiphospholipid syndrome, Wegener's granulomatosis, Sjögren's syndrome, Bell's palsy, Guillain-Barré syndrome, multiple sclerosis, autoimmune thyroid disease, vasculitis, or glomerulonephritis.\n\n  * Patients with a history of autoimmune hypothyroidism on a stable dose of thyroid replacement hormone may be eligible.\n  * Patients with controlled Type 1 diabetes mellitus on a stable insulin regimen may be eligible.\n  * Patients with eczema, psoriasis, lichen simplex chronicus of vitiligo with dermatologic manifestations only (e.g., patients with psoriatic arthritis would be excluded) are permitted provided that they meet the following conditions:\n\n    * Patients with psoriasis must have a baseline ophthalmologic exam to rule out ocular manifestations\n    * Rash must cover less than 10% of body surface area (BSA)\n    * Disease is well controlled at baseline and only requiring low potency topical steroids (e.g., hydrocortisone 2.5%, hydrocortisone butyrate 0.1%, flucinolone 0.01%, desonide 0.05%, aclometasone dipropionate 0.05%)\n    * No acute exacerbations of underlying condition within the last 12 months (not requiring psoralen plus ultraviolet A radiation [PUVA], methotrexate, retinoids, biologic agents, oral calcineurin inhibitors; high potency or oral steroids)\n* History of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, pneumonitis (including drug induced), organizing pneumonia (i.e., bronchiolitis obliterans, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, etc.), or evidence of active pneumonitis on screening chest computed tomography (CT) scan.\n* Uncontrolled or significant cardiovascular disease\n* History of any chronic hepatitis as evidenced by the following:\n\n  * Positive test for hepatitis B surface antigen\n  * Positive test for qualitative hepatitis C viral load (by polymerase chain reaction [PCR]).\n* Positive test for latent tuberculosis (TB) at screening (e.g. T-SPOT or Quantiferon test) or evidence of active TB.\n* Major surgical procedure within 28 days prior to Cycle 1, Day 1 or anticipation of need for a major surgical procedure during the course of the study with the exception of the planned breast cancer surgery that is part of the trial design.
