    "official_title": "A Phase II Trial of Bevacizumab and Rucaparib in Recurrent Carcinoma of the Cervix or Endometrium",
    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Patients with histologically-documented carcinoma of the cervix or endometrium.\n2. Patients with measurable and/or evaluable lesions as defined by RECIST 1.1.\n3. Women at least 18 years of age\n4. Patients with persistent or recurrent squamous cell or adenocarcinoma of the cervix, or any carcinoma or carcinosarcoma of the endometrium who has undergone at least one prior line of systemic therapy. Prior bevacizumab is allowed. (Note: previous cisplatin during radiation therapy should NOT count as a prior line of systemic therapy).\n5. ECOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2.\n6. Patients should agree to have tumor biopsy for correlative studies.If the patients are unable to be safely biopsied and desire enrollment, they may be enrolled per principal investigator discretion.\n7. Adequate organ function should be confirmed by the following laboratory values obtained ≤ 14 days prior to first dose of rucaparib.\n8. Patients must have a life expectancy of at least 3 months ((to be able to complete one cycle of study treatment).\n9. Patients should have no major existing co-morbidities or medical conditions that will preclude therapy in the view of the principal investigator.\n10. Prior bevacizumab is allowed if off drug ≥ 28 days prior to study enrollment.\n11. Women of childbearing potential must not be considering getting pregnant and must avoid pregnancy during the study and for at least six months after the last dose of rucaparib or longer if requested by local authorities.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be FEMALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 99 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Have active second malignancy, i.e., patient known to have potentially fatal cancer present for which she may be (but not necessarily) currently receiving treatment; However patients with a history of malignancy that has been completely treated, with no evidence of that cancer currently, are permitted to enroll in the trial provided all chemotherapy was completed >6 months prior and/or bone marrow transplant (BMT) >2 years prior to first dose of rucaparib.\n2. Prior treatment with any PARP inhibitor.\n3. Untreated or symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastases.Patients with asymptomatic CNS metastases are eligible provided they have been clinically stable for at least 4 weeks.\n4. Patients who have received treatment with chemotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C); or radiation, biologic/targeted agents, experimental drugs within 3 weeks prior to first dose of rucaparib; and/or ongoing adverse effects from such treatment > NCI CTCAE Grade 1 (Grade 2 non-hematologic toxicity to most recent treatment may be permitted with prior advanced approval from Sponsor).\n5. Hospitalization for bowel obstruction within 3 months prior to enrollment.\n6. Patients must have no history of gross hemoptysis (defined as bright red blood of a ½ teaspoon or more) or coagulopathy. Patients with history of major tumor-related bleeding that is not controlled despite locoregional treatment or at high risk of recurrent tumor-related bleeding will be excluded.\n7. Patients with history of hypertension must be well-controlled (≤150/100) on a stable regimen of anti-hypertensive therapy.\n8. Patients with tumors that invaded major vessels (e.g. the carotid) as shown unequivocally by imaging studies will be excluded due to the possibility of increased risk for tumor bleeding with bevacizumab therapy.\n9. Patients should not have a major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury within 28 days prior to study enrollment, or anticipation of need for major surgical procedure during the course of the study. No history of abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation, or intra-abdominal abscess within 28 days prior to registration. No serious non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture.\n10. Patients should not have unstable angina or myocardial infarction within the previous 6 months; no uncontrolled hypertension; no symptomatic congestive heart failure; no serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication; no clinically significant peripheral vascular disease; no history of any CNS cerebrovascular ischemia or stroke within the last 6 months; no active serious infection.\n11. Patients should not have other coexisting medical condition that would preclude full compliance with the study.\n12. Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.\n13. Patients should not have a history of prior severe infusion reaction to a monoclonal antibody. Patients with known hypersensitivity of Chinese hamster ovary cell products or other recombinant human antibodies.\n14. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because rucaparib and bevacizumab have the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with rucaparib and bevacizumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with rucaparib and bevacizumab. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.\n15. HIV-positive patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from the study because of possible drug interactions with rucaparib and bevacizumab.",
