    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Female participants ≥ 18 years of age\n2. Participants must have a confirmed diagnosis of high-grade serious epithelial ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal cancer, or fallopian tube cancer\n3. Participants must have platinum-resistant disease:\n\n   1.

Participants who have received 2 or 3 lines of platinum therapy must have progressed on or within 6 months after the date of the last dose of platinum Note: Progression should be calculated from the date of the last administered dose of platinum therapy to the date of the radiographic imaging showing progression. Note: Participants who are platinum-refractory during front-line treatment are excluded\n4. Participants must have progressed radiographically on or after their most recent line of therapy\n5. Participants must be willing to provide an archival tumor tissue block or slides, or undergo procedure to obtain a new biopsy using a low risk, medically routine procedure for immunohistochemistry (IHC) confirmation of FRα positivity\n6.

Participants must have received at least 1 but no more than 3 prior systemic lines of anticancer therapy, and for whom single-agent therapy is appropriate as the next line of treatment:\n\n   1. Adjuvant ± neoadjuvant considered one line of therapy\n   2. Maintenance therapy (for example, bevacizumab, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase [PARP] inhibitors) will be considered as part of the preceding line of therapy (that is, not counted independently)\n   3. Therapy changed due to toxicity in the absence of progression will be considered as part of the same line (that is, not counted independently)\n   4. Hormonal therapy will be counted as a separate line of therapy unless it was given as maintenance\n9. Participant must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) of 0 or 1\n10. Time from prior therapy:\n\n    1. Systemic antineoplastic therapy (5 half-lives or 4 weeks, whichever is shorter)\n    2. Focal radiation completed at least 2 weeks prior to first dose of study drug\n11. Participants must have stabilized or recovered (Grade 1 or baseline) from all prior therapy-related toxicities\n12. Major surgery must be completed at least 4 weeks prior to first dose and have recovered or stabilized from the side effects of prior surgery\n13. Participants must have adequate hematologic, liver and kidney functions defined as:\n\n    1. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 10^9/liter (L) (1,500/microliter [μL]) without granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in the prior 10 days or long-acting white blood cell (WBC) growth factors in the prior 20 days\n    2.

Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 3.0 x ULN\n    6. Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN (participants with documented diagnosis of Gilbert syndrome are eligible if total bilirubin < 3.0 x ULN\n    7. Serum albumin ≥ 2 grams (g)/deciliter (dL)\n14. Participants or their legally authorized representative must be willing and able to sign the informed consent form (ICF) and to adhere to the protocol requirements\n15. Women of childbearing potential (WCBP) must agree to use highly effective contraceptive method(s) while on study drug and for at least 3 months after the last dose of MIRV or at least 6 months after the last dose of paclitaxel, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, or topotecan\n16.
