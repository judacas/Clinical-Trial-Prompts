    "official_title": "A Phase II Trial of Focal Ultrahypofractionated Stereotactic Radiation Therapy for the Treatment of Unifocal Prostate Cancer",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* INCLUSION CRITERIA:\n* Participants must have histologically confirmed, low or intermediate risk prostatic adenocarcinoma verified by biopsy (NIH Laboratory of Pathology confirmation is required).\n* Unifocal prostate cancer defined as a single focus of prostate cancer on MRI and PSMA PET/CT imaging which is correlated with a positive targeted biopsy.\n* Age >=18 years.\n* ECOG performance status <=2 (Karnofsky >60%).\n* Men must agree to use highly effective contraception with their partner (barrier method of birth control; abstinence) for the duration of study participation and up to 120 days after the last radiation treatment.\n* Ability of individual to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\n* Participants with NCCN high-risk prostate cancer features (Gleason score >=8, >cT2c, or PSA >= 20 ng/mL).\n* Participants with prostate biopsies which show >= grade group 2 adenocarcinoma determined to be outside of the radiographically visible lesion (systematic biopsies which map to a radiographically detected lesion are not an exclusion criterion).\n* Participants in whom concurrent systemic Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) or chemotherapy is planned.\n* Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.\n* Participants found to have pelvic or distant metastases on pre-treatment staging studies.\n* Participants with an AUA-SI/IPSS score > 18.\n* Participants who have previously received curative treatment for a prior or the current diagnosis of prostate cancer.\n* Active urinary tract infection assessed by urinalysis.\n* Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals who are not on effective anti-retroviral therapy. Participants on anti-retroviral therapy with undetectable viral load within the 6 months prior to registration are eligible for this trial.\n* Participants with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection who have not been treated and cured.\n* Participants with chronic HBV at screening must have an undetectable HBV viral load on suppressive therapy.\n* Participants with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection who have not been treated and cured.\n* Participants with HCV infection who are currently on treatment, are eligible if they have an undetectable HCV viral load at screening.\n* Anatomic relationship between the tumor and adjacent normal tissues judged to be unfeasible for the planned treatment by the PI.\n* Participants with connective tissue diseases.\n* Participants with radiation hypersensitivity syndromes.\n* Ongoing active inflammatory bowel disease within the radiation field.\n* Participants with prior medical comorbidity or surgical history involving the low pelvis which is expected to confer a high risk of toxicity to the experimental radiation regimen.\n* Ineligibility or unwillingness to undergo a contrast-enhanced MRI due to inadequate renal function (eGFR < 30), severe claustrophobia, a weight above tolerance of the scanner (> 350 lbs.), a body size unable to fit into the scanner, or implanted devices incompatible with an MRI (implanted cardiac devices, surgical hardware, retained shrapnel, cerebral aneurysm clips, or other incompatible objects.\n* Unwillingness to undergo an 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT or known allergy to the 18F-DCFPyL tracer.\n* Contraindication or inability to undergo fiducial marker implantation.\n* History of prior radiotherapy overlapping with the intended radiation field.\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness, factors, or social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be MALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 120 Years",
