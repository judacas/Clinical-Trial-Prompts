    "official_title": "A Phase II Study of Sodium Thiosulfate (STS) for Prevention of Ototoxicity in Patients With Locally Advanced Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck (SCCHN) Undergoing Concurrent Chemoradiation With Cisplatin",
    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Participants must have histologically or cytologically confirmed locoregionally advanced squamous cell carcinomas of mucosal surfaces of head and neck who are being treated with concurrent chemoradiation with cisplatin\n2. Participants must be eligible for cisplatin-based concurrent chemotherapy in conjunction with at least 6 weeks of daily fractionated radiation therapy\n3. Age >=18 years\n4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =< 2 (Karnofsky >= 50%)\n5. Demonstrates adequate organ function as defined below:\n\n   1. Absolute neutrophil count >= 1,000/microliter (mcL)\n   2. Platelets >= 100,000/mcL\n   3. Total bilirubin within normal institutional limits, unless elevated due to Gilbert's syndrome and direct bilirubin is within normal limits\n   4. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)(serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT)) =< 3 X institutional upper limit of normal\n   5. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT)(serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT)) =< 3 X institutional upper limit of normal\n   6. Creatinine =< 1.5 x within institutional upper limit of normal OR creatinine clearance glomerular filtration rate (GFR) >= 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2, calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault equation, unless data exists supporting safe use at lower kidney function values, no lower than 30 mL/min/1.73 m^2\n6. Ability to understand a written informed consent document, and the willingness to sign it\n7. Individuals with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen are eligible for this trial\n8. The effects of sodium thiosulfate (STS) on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because cisplatin used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception such as hormonal and/or barrier method of birth control for the duration of study participation and for 3 months after last administration of study treatment. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 3 months after last administration of study treatment\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Participants that are not eligible for cisplatin-based chemoradiation for reasons such as chronic kidney disease, severe hearing loss, and severe peripheral neuropathy\n2. Uncontrolled inter-current illness or psychiatric illness/social situation that would limit compliance with study requirements\n3. Has known hypersensitivity to cisplatin, sodium thiosulfate or any of its excipients\n4. Has profound hearing impairment at baseline and cannot hear a sound below 90 decibels (dB)\n5. Participants with uncompensated congestive heart failure New York Heart Association (NYHA) class 3 or above\n6. Participants who cannot get secure venous access using either a Mediport or a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line for safe administration of intravenous sodium thiosulfate\n7. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because cisplatin is a cytotoxic agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with cisplatin or sodium thiosulfate, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with either agent",
