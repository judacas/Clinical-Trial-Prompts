Evidence of post-menopausal status or negative urinary or serum pregnancy test for female pre-menopausal patients. Women will be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrheic for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. The following age-specific requirements apply:\n\n   * Women <50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal treatments and if they have luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone levels in the post-menopausal range for the institution or underwent surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy).\n   * Women ≥50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments, had radiation-induced menopause with last menses >1 year ago, had chemotherapy-induced menopause with last menses >1 year ago, or underwent surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or hysterectomy).\n8. Female patients of childbearing potential who are not abstinent and intend to be sexually active with a nonsterilized male partner must use at least 1 highly effective method of contraception (Table 11) from the time of screening throughout the total duration of the study drug treatment and 90 days after the last dose of study drug. Non-sterilized male partners of a female patient of childbearing potential must use male condom plus spermicide throughout this period. Cessation of birth control after this point should be discussed with a responsible physician. Periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of birth control. Female patients should also refrain from breastfeeding throughout this period.\n9. Non-sterilized male patients who are not abstinent and intend to be sexually active with a female partner of childbearing potential must use a male condom plus spermicide from the time of screening throughout the total duration of the study drug treatment and 90 days after the last dose of study drug. However, periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of contraception. Male patients should refrain from sperm donation throughout this period.\n10. Must have a life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.\n\nAdditional Inclusion Criteria for Phase 1b 11. Body weight > 30 kg 12.

Exceptions: 1) The use of physiologic doses of corticosteroids (i.e., ≤10 mg per day of equivalent prednisone) is allowed; 2) Steroids with no or minimal systemic effect (topical, inhalation) are allowed; 3) Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency) is not considered a form of systemic treatment; (4) Steroids as premedication for hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., CT scan premedication).\n2.

These imaging scans should both be obtained at least four weeks apart and show no evidence of intracranial progression). In addition, any neurologic symptoms that developed either as a result of the brain metastases or their treatment must have resolved or be stable either, without the use of steroids, or are stable on a steroid dose of ≤10 mg/day of prednisone or its equivalent for at least 14 days prior to the start of treatment. Brain metastases will not be recorded as RECIST Target Lesions at baseline.\n5.
