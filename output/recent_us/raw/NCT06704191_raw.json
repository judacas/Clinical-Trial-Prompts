    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Subject is able to comprehend and is willing to sign an informed consent for participation in this study.\n2. Male or female ≥ 18 years old.\n3. Subject has a clinical diagnosis of stable clinically typical seborrheic keratosis.\n4. Subject has 4 appropriate seborrheic keratosis Target Lesions on the trunk, extremities and face, with at least 1 Target Lesion on the face and at least 1 Target Lesion on the trunk or extremities. The 4 identified Target Lesions must meet the requirements as defined below:\n\n   1. Have a clinically typical appearance\n   2. Have a Physician's Lesion Assessment of ≥ 2\n   3. Length that is ≥ 5mm and ≤ 15mm\n   4. Width that is ≥ 5mm and ≤ 15 mm\n   5. Thickness that is ≤ 2mm\n   6. Be a discrete lesion\n   7.
