Central tumors ≤ 2 cm from any mediastinal critical structure (proximal bronchial tree, esophagus, heart, brachial plexus, major vessels, spinal cord, phrenic nerve, and recurrent laryngeal nerve\n3. Age ≥ 18 years\n4. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
