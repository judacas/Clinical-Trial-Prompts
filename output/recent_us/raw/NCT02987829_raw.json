    "official_title": "A Phase 1/2 Study of bbT369, a Dual Targeting CAR T Cell Drug Product With a Gene Edit, in Relapsed and/or Refractory B Cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL)",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* ≥18 years of age at the time of signing informed consent.\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 2.\n* Diagnosis of B-cell NHL according to WHO 2017 classification or WHO 2016 classification where applicable:\n\n  1. DLBCL (germinal center B cell [GCB] or activated B cell [ABC] type or not otherwise specified [NOS])\n  2. HGBCL (with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements or NOS)\n  3. PMBCL\n  4. FL 3b\n  5. DLBCL transformed from FL\n* Participants must have relapsed or refractory (r/r) B cell NHL after autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) or at least 2 prior lines of therapy including an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody and an anthracycline containing chemotherapy regimen. Note: participants with DLBCL transformed from FL must have r/r disease after ASCT or at least 2 prior therapies following transformation irrespective of therapeutic agents.\n* At least 1 FDG-avid lesion per Lugano Classification criteria at time of enrollment.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Treatment with any investigational cellular therapy prior to enrollment. Treatment with an approved anti-CD19 CAR T cell therapy in an investigational setting may be permitted after discussion with and approval of the Sponsor.\n* Progression within 6 weeks of prior anti-CD19 CAR T cell therapy.\n* Residual toxicities or end-organ damage to vital organs from prior therapy that could put a subject at undue risk based on Investigator's assessment. Toxicities related to prior cytokine release syndrome (CRS) or neurotoxicity must be resolved.\n* If a subject has received prior anti-CD19 CAR T therapy, development of ≥ Grade 3 CAR T related CRS or ≥ Grade 3 neurotoxicity that in the opinion of the Investigator would cause unacceptable risk of toxicity to the subject upon treatment with bbT369.\n* Primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma or a history or presence of clinically relevant CNS pathology.\n* Active autoimmune disease requiring systemic immunosuppressive and/or cytotoxic therapy within the past two years.\n* Treatment with any prior anti-CD79a therapy.\n* Previous history of an allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is permitted.",
