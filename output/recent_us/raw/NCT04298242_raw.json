Male participants: A male participant must agree to use a contraception during the treatment period and for at least 120 days after the last dose of study treatment and refrain from donating sperm during this period.\n\n3. Female participants:\n\nA female participant is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant, not breastfeeding, and at least one of the following conditions applies:\n\n1. Not a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP)\n\n   OR\n2. A WOCBP who agrees to follow the contraceptive guidance during the treatment period and for at least 120 days after the last dose of study treatment.\n\n   4. The participant (or legally acceptable representative if applicable) provides written informed consent for the trial.\n\n   5. Have at least a single site of measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1. Lesions situated in a previously irradiated area are considered measurable if progression has been demonstrated in such lesions.\n\n   6. Willing to undergo pre-treatment biopsies.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n1. Prior archival tumor tissue sample are not permitted.\n2. Minimum tissue requirements: core (16G or 18G, 6 cores; preferred), punch or excisional biopsy of a tumor lesion that has not been previously irradiated.\n\n   7. Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1.\n\na. ECOG evaluation should be performed at Screening and repeated on Cycle 1 Day 1.\n\n8. Have adequate organ function, per protocol criteria\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
