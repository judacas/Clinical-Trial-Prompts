In metastatic patients, preferentially, invasive tumor in breast or lymph node tissue will be retrieved by excisional biopsy to ensure sufficient yield. In metastatic patients who undergo initiation of first-line standard of care systemic therapy off study (i.e. pembrolizumab and chemotherapy in a PD-L1 positive patient), then ideally collection of tumor tissue will occur prior to treatment initiation of standard of care therapy to maximize cellularity. Metastatic patients who have undergone mastectomy during curative treatment initially or have no invasive disease in the breast, chest wall, or accessible regional lymph nodes, will be evaluated for image-guided core biopsies of liver metastasis or video-assisted thorascopic wedge resection of lung metastasis\n\n  * In patients with early stage TNBC undergoing upfront surgery, the tumor tissue will be retrieved during lumpectomy/mastectomy. In early stage patients who are identified as high risk of having residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy or undergo upfront resection, tissue will be retrieved during planned lumpectomy or mastectomy\n* Measurable disease is not required in metastatic patients but patients must have sufficient tumor to yield 1g on biopsy to enable production of personalized TMV vaccine product\n* Patients will undergo germline testing to assess for a BRCA1/BRCA2 deleterious mutation.
