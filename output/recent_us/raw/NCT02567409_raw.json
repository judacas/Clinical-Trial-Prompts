Absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) >500/μL. Platelets ≥75K. Bilirubin ≤3xULN. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/ Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) <5x upper limit of normal (ULN). Serum creatinine ≤1.0mg/dL or 1.5x ULN for age (whichever is higher). Pulse oximetry >90% on room air.\n\n* Parent(s)/guardian(s) capable of providing informed consent.\n* Availability of sufficient pre-trial fresh frozen tumor tissue (approximately 50 mg).\n* Patient deemed to be of sufficient size to undergo PBMC pheresis for TSA-T generation and PBSC rescue.\n* Patient is a surgical candidate for placement of Rickham reservoir in the opinion of a physician.\n\nRECIPIENT INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR INITIAL TSA-T ADMINISTRATION AND FOR ADDITIONAL INFUSIONS\n\n* Lansky score of ≥60%.\n* Organ function:\n\nBilirubin ≤3x ULN. AST/ALT ≤5x ULN. Serum creatinine ≤1.0mg/dL or 1.5x ULN for age (whichever is higher). Pulse oximetry >90% on room air.\n\n- Neurologic status: Patient must have a stable neurologic exam for 2 weeks, on a stable or decreasing dose of steroids, prior to administration of the first dose of TSA-T cells, and stability for 1 week prior to all subsequent infusions. The exams demonstrating stability must be performed by the study team, although these may occur via telemedicine if necessary. Patient must agree to a brief (<72 hours) course of steroids\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 1 Day\nMust have maximum age of 4 Years",

These include the following:\n\nTumor with any evidence of herniation or significant midline shift. Tumor with a significant brainstem component. Patients who are deemed to have overly bulky tumor by the principal investigator (PI) of the study.\n\nRECIPIENT EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR INITIAL AND SUBSEQUENT TSA-T INFUSIONS\n\n* Patients with uncontrolled infections.\n* Patients who have overly bulky tumors on imaging are ineligible. These include the following:\n\nTumor with any evidence of herniation or significant midline shift. Tumor with a significant brainstem component. Patients who are deemed to have overly bulky tumor by the PI of the study.\n\n* Patients who received ATG, Campath or other immunosuppressive T cell monoclonal antibodies within 28 days of TSA-T infusion.\n* Patients receiving dexamethasone at a dose of >0.05mg/kg.
