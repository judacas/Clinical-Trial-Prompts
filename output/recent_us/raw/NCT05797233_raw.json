    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Psoriatic arthritis meeting CASPAR criteria;\n2. Active psoriatic arthritis defined by at least 1 swollen joint;\n3. cDAPSA score ≥ 10; See also Exclusion #4 - cDAPSA must be > 14 in patients without psoriasis.\n4. Using a TNFi or previously used a single TNFi historically and either never responded or lost response (TNF IR) and planning to switch to a new biologic therapy;\n5. If using an oral small molecule/csDMARD (i.e., methotrexate, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, or apremilast), must be on a stable dose for 4 weeks and remain on a stable dose during the study; Use of up to two OSM/csDMARDs is allowed.\n6. If using NSAIDs, glucocorticoids (<10 mg daily) or topical medications for psoriasis, must be on a stable dose for 4 weeks prior to Screening/Baseline 1 and remain on a stable dose during the study;\n7. Age 18-80 (patients older than 80 may be more likely to have concomitant osteoarthritis which may make it difficult to assess whether symptoms are related to PsA vs OA).\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 80 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Prior exposure to golimumab or another non-TNFi biologic (IL12/23i, JAKi, an IL17i, or an IL23i); prior exposure to a TYK2i is acceptable, but cannot be used during course of the study;\n2. An adverse event that precludes use of another TNFi (development of drug-induced SLE, allergic reaction, serious infection, heart failure symptoms, demyelination at any point during use of therapy) or any other contraindication or substantial intolerance to a TNFi;\n3. Use of moderate to high dose glucocorticoids (>10 mg);\n4. Already meets the primary endpoint at Baseline; [cDAPSA low disease activity ≤ 14; IGA of psoriasis 0/1] In patients with psoriasis, cDAPSA can be 10-14 IF the Investigator Global Assessment of Psoriasis ≥ 2.\n\n   In patients without psoriasis, cDAPSA must be > 14 to meet eligibility requirements.\n5. Currently pregnant or actively trying to conceive.",
