Systemic therapy with poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor will be counted as one line of therapy.\n* HGSOC participants only (Dose Expansion): Progressed on no more than 5 prior lines of systemic therapy for locally advanced or metastatic disease (not including adjuvant or neo-adjuvant). Systemic therapy with (PARP) inhibitor will be counted as one line of therapy. Induction followed by maintenance will be counted as one line of therapy.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 99 Years",
