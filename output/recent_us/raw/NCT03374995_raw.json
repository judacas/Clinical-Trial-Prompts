The HCV RNA test will be performed only for patients who have a positive HCV antibody test.\n4. Negative human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) test at screening with the following exception: individuals with a positive HIV test at screening are eligible provided they are stable on anti-retroviral therapy, have a CD4+ T cell count ≥200/L, and have an undetectable viral load.\n5. Patients with previously treated brain metastases may participate if they completed radiation therapy, are clinically stable, and without requirement of steroid treatment for at least 2 weeks prior to study enrollment.\n6. Patients with known history or current symptoms of cardiac disease, or history of treatment with cardiotoxic agents, should have a clinical risk assessment of cardiac function using the New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Classification. To be eligible for this trial, patients should have NYHA functional classification of 2B or better.\n7. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative urine pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to study treatment initiation. If a WOCBP has a urine pregnancy test that cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum (beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [β-hCG]) pregnancy test will be required.\n8. The effects of tiragolumab and atezolizumab on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because tiragolumab and atezolizumab as well as other therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, WOCBP must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of the study treatment period, and for 90 days after the final dose of tiragolumab and 5 months after the final dose of atezolizumab. (Refer to Pregnancy Assessment Policy MDACC Institutional Policy # CLN1114). This includes all female patients, between the onset of menses (as early as 8 years of age) and 55 years unless the patient presents with an applicable exclusionary factor, which may be one of the following:\n\n<!-- -->\n\n1.

Ovarian failure (follicle-stimulating hormone and estradiol in menopausal range and have received whole pelvic radiation therapy). History of bilateral tubal ligation or another surgical sterilization procedure.\n\n   * Approved methods of birth control are as follows: Hormonal contraception (i.e. birth control pills, injection, implant, transdermal patch, vaginal ring), intrauterine device, tubal ligation or hysterectomy, subject/partner post vasectomy, implantable or injectable contraceptives, and condoms plus spermicide. Not engaging in sexual activity for the total duration of the study and the drug washout period is an acceptable practice; however, periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of birth control. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.\n   * Men must agree to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use a condom plus spermicide, and agree to refrain from donating sperm, as defined below:\n\n   With a female partner of childbearing potential, men who are not surgically sterile must remain abstinent or use a condom plus spermicideduring the study treatment period and for 90 days after the final dose of tiragolumab. Men mustrefrain from donating sperm during this same period.\n\n   With a pregnant female partner, men must remain abstinent or use a condom plus spermicide during the treatment period for 90 days after the final dose of tiragolumab.\n   * Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n   * Ability to comply with the study protocol.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
