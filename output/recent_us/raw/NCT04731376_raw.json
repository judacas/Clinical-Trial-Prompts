    "inclusion_criteria": "* Patient must have a known diagnosis of NSCLC, HCC, or HNSCC as defined in the protocol\n* Patient must be willing and able to provide blood samples at the indicated time points\n* Patient must be willing and able to have excisional or core needle biopsies of tumor prior to initiation of cemiplimab as defined in the protocol\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1\n* Patient is determined to be a surgical candidate for resection of their tumor\n* Adequate organ and bone marrow function as defined in the protocol\n\nKey\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Patients who have had any systemic anti-cancer therapy or radiotherapy within 6 months prior to entering the study for their current tumor or a different primary tumor\n* Patients whose tumor burden, or pace of tumor growth, in the opinion of the Investigator will not permit delaying surgery\n* Patients who have participated in a study of an investigational agent or an investigational device within 4 weeks of study therapy or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer)\n* Patients who have had major surgery within 14 days prior to initiation of neoadjuvant Therapy\n* Patients with metastatic disease for whom the intent of surgery would not be curative\n* Uncontrolled, intercurrent illness as defined in the protocol and as determined by the Investigator\n* Is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of study treatment\n* Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 1 year\n* Has a known, additional malignancy that is progressing and/or requires active treatment. Exceptions include patients with: basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy; in situ cervical or anal cancer; prostate cancer on stable dose of hormonal therapy without rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA); breast cancer who have been treated with curative intent, who may be on hormonal therapy.\n* Encephalitis, meningitis, or uncontrolled seizures in the year prior to informed consent\n* History of interstitial lung disease (eg, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, organizing pneumonia) or active, noninfectious pneumonitis that required immune-suppressive doses of glucocorticoids to assist with management. A history of radiation pneumonitis in the radiation field is permitted as long as pneumonitis resolved ≥6 months prior to study treatment.\n* Uncontrolled infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), HBV or hepatitis C infection (HCV); or diagnosis of immunodeficiency as defined in the protocol\n* NSCLC cohorts only: Patients do not have a history of smoking. History of smoking is defined as smoking ≥100 cigarettes in a lifetime.\n* NSCLC cohorts only: Patients with tumors tested positive for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutations, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene translocations, or c-ros oncogene 1 (ROS1) fusions.\n\nNote: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria apply",
