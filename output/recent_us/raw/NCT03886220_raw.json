Acceptable supplements include multivitamins, vitamin D and calcium\n  * Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy\n* Receipt of a live vaccine within 30 days prior to starting study drug. Examples of live vaccines are: intranasal influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, oral polio, BCG, yellow fever, varicella, and TY21a typhoid vaccines.\n* Patient is currently receiving or has received systemic corticosteroids ≤2 weeks prior to starting study drug, or who have not fully recovered from side effects of such treatment.\n\n  • The following uses of corticosteroids are permitted: single doses, topical applications (e.g., for rash), inhaled sprays (e.g., for obstructive airways diseases), eye drops or local injections (e.g., intra-articular)\n* Patient is currently receiving warfarin or other coumarin-derived anticoagulant for treatment, prophylaxis or otherwise. Therapy with heparin, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or fondaparinux is allowed.\n* Treatment with an investigational agent within 30 days prior or within 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) before the first dose of the study drug.\n* Patient who has received radiotherapy ≤4 weeks or limited field radiation for palliation ≤2 weeks prior to starting study drug, and who has not recovered to Grade 1 or better from related side effects of such therapy (exceptions include alopecia) and/or in whom ≥25% of the bone marrow (Ellis, 1961) was irradiated.\n* Patient has had major surgery within 14 days prior to starting study drug or has not recovered from major side effects (tumor biopsy is not considered as major surgery).\n* Patient has not recovered from all toxicities related to prior anticancer therapies to NCI-CTCAE version 4.03 Grade ≤1 (Exception to this criterion: patients with any Grade of alopecia are allowed to enter the study).\n* Patient with a Child-Pugh score B or C. See Appendix A.\n* Patient has a history of non-compliance to medical regimen or inability to grant consent.\n* Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a positive hCG laboratory test.\n* Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception throughout the study and for at least 3 months after completion of treatment. Highly effective contraception methods include:\n\n  * Total abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception\n  * Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy), total hysterectomy, or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment\n  * Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). The vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient\n  * Use of 1 highly effective method of contraception, and 1 additional (barrier) method, at the same time\n\nHighly effective methods: Intra-uterine devices (IUD), Hormonal (birth control pills/oral contraceptives, injectable contraceptives, contraceptive patches, or contraceptive implants) Other effective methods (barrier methods): Latex condom, Diaphragm with spermicide; Cervical cap; Sponge\n\n* Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential.\n* Sexually active males unless they use a condom during intercourse while taking the drug and for 21 days after stopping treatment and should not father a child in this period. A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent delivery of the drug via seminal fluid.\n\nInclusion Criteria Step 2 (LMS patients only):\n\n- Patients with leiomyosarcoma must have tumors with intact Rb as documented by protein expression by IHC for study entry. Patients without sufficient archival tissue for testing will not be eligible. Please see Section 9.0 for further details on testing and interpretation of results. In the event that a patient has prior sequencing information (i.e. through commercial testing) suggestive of intact Rb, the patient may be included into the study on a case by case basis as determined by the principle investigators. The patient will still be required to submit tissue for Rb determination by IHC, but will not need to wait for these results for study entry.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
