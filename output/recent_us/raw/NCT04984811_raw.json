    "exclusion_criteria": "* Patients with active extramedullary disease.\n* Patients with active central nervous system malignancy.\n* Active and/or uncontrolled infection at the time of allo-HCT.\n* Patients who have undergone previous allo-HCT.\n* Patients who have undergone previous autologous HCT within the last 6 months, with the exclusion of high-risk multiple myeloma patients.\n* Patient seropositivity for HIV I/II and/or HTLV I/II.\n* Females who are pregnant or breastfeeding.\n* Patients unwilling to use contraception during the study period.\n* Patient or guardian unable to give informed consent or unable to comply with the treatment protocol.\n\nDonor Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria:\n\n* Must be a 10/10 HLA genotypically matched related or unrelated donor at A, B, C, DRB1, and DQB1 loci, as tested by DNA analysis.\n* Able to provide informed consent for the donation process per institutional standards.\n* Meet standard criteria for donor collection as defined by the National Marrow Donor Program Guidelines.",
