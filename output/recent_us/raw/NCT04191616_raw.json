    "inclusion_criteria": "* Age >= 18 years\n* Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of pancreatic origin with pathologic material reviewed by the Department of Pathology at Mayo Clinic, if available and applicable\n* Image proven oligometastatic pancreatic cancer patients (i.e., synchronous & metachronous)\n\n  * Oligometastatic defined as: =< 5 extracranial metastatic tumors (brain metastasis patients are excluded; indeterminate lung nodules stable on 2 consecutive imaging studies spaced more than 4 weeks apart will not count as sites of oligometastatic disease)\n  * All sites must be amenable to SBRT (positive peritoneal washings cytology or Kras cell free (cf)DNA, and positive peritoneal biopsy would be considered ineligible)\n* Measurable disease as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria\n* Non-measurable disease\n\n  * NOTE: Tumor lesions in a previously irradiated area are not considered measurable disease; disease that is measurable by physical examination only is not eligible\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 0, 1 or 2\n* Negative pregnancy test done =< 7days prior to registration, for women of childbearing potential only\n\n  * NOTE: If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required\n* Ability to complete questionnaire(s) by themselves or with assistance\n* Provide written informed consent\n* Willing to return to enrolling institution for follow-up (during the Active Monitoring Phase of the study)\n* Willing to provide tissue and/or blood samples for correlative research purposes\n* Hemoglobin >= 9.0 g/dL (obtained =< 28 days prior to registration)\n* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >= 1500/mm^3 (obtained =< 28 days prior to registration)\n* Platelet count >= 100,000/mm^3 (obtained =< 28 days prior to registration)\n* Total bilirubin =< 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) (If known Gilbert's syndrome, then =< 3.0 x ULN) (obtained =< 28 days prior to registration)\n* Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) =< 3 x ULN (=< 5 x ULN for patients with liver involvement) (obtained =< 28 days prior to registration)\n* Prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR)/activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) =< 1.5 x ULN OR if patient is receiving anticoagulant therapy and INR or aPTT is within target range of therapy (obtained =< 28 days prior to registration)\n* Calculated creatinine clearance >= 45 ml/min using the Cockcroft-Gault formula (obtained =< 28 days prior to registration)\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Pregnant women\n* Nursing women\n* Men or women of childbearing potential who are unwilling to employ adequate contraception\n* Any of the following prior therapies:\n\n  * Surgery =< 3 weeks prior to registration\n  * Prior radiation to an overlapping area\n* Co-morbid systemic illnesses or other severe concurrent disease which, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study or interfere significantly with the proper assessment of safety and toxicity of the prescribed regimens\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to:\n\n  * Ongoing or active infection\n  * Symptomatic congestive heart failure\n  * Unstable angina pectoris\n  * Cardiac arrhythmia\n  * Or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements\n* Receiving any other investigational agent which would be considered as a treatment for the primary neoplasm\n* Other active malignancy =< 1 year prior to registration\n\n  * EXCEPTIONS: Non-melanotic skin cancer or carcinoma-in-situ of the cervix\n  * NOTE: If there is a history of prior malignancy, they must not be receiving other specific treatment for their cancer\n* History of myocardial infarction =< 6 months, or congestive heart failure requiring use of ongoing maintenance therapy for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias",
