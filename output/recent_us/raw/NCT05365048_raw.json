To be eligible for this trial, patients should be class 2B or better\n* Patients of child-bearing potential (POCBP) must agree to use two forms of adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control, abstinence) from time of informed consent and for the duration of study participation. Patients who can impregnate their partners must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control, abstinence) from time of informed consent and for the duration of study participation\n\n  * Should a patient become pregnant or suspect they are pregnant while they or their partner is participating in this study, they should inform their treating physician immediately.\n  * Note: At the discretion of the investigator, acceptable methods of contraception may include total abstinence in cases where the lifestyle of the patient ensures compliance. (Periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.)\n  * Note: A POCBP is any person with an egg-producing reproductive tract (regardless of gender, sexual orientation, having undergone a tubal ligation, or remaining celibate by choice) who meets the following criteria:\n\n    * Has not undergone a hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy\n    * Has had menses at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months (and therefore has not been naturally postmenopausal for > 12 months) (in patients > 45 years of age in the absence of other biological or physiological causes)\n\n      * Potential POCBP who may be menopausal and are < 55 years of age must have a serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level > 40 mIU/mL to confirm menopause\n      * Note: Documentation may include review of medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview by study site staff\n* Patient must be willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study and provide written, signed, and dated informed consent prior to study registration.\n\n  * NOTE: No study-specific screening procedures may be performed until written consent has been obtained\n* Patients must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Patients who have a prior or concurrent malignancy that may interfere with study treatment or safety\n\n  * NOTE: Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen are eligible, per principal investigator (PI) discretion\n* Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.\n\n  * Exceptions: COVID-19 vaccine and treatment is allowed, per PI's discretion\n* Patient's interval since last cytotoxic therapy ≥ 1 cycle or ≥ 2 biological half-lives, i.e.\n\n  * ≥ 28 days since start of last cycle of temozolomide (cycle length-28 days)\n  * ≥ 42 days since start of last cycle of lomustine or other nitrosourea (cycle length-42 days)\n  * ≥ 21 days since start of last cycle of a small molecule targeted agent (cycle length-21 days)\n  * ≥ 42 days from last bevacizumab infusion (cycle length-42 days)\n* Patients who have a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical composition to temozolomide or triapine\n* Patients with spinal cord and diffuse leptomeningeal dissemination\n* Patients with a history of G6PD deficiency or other congenital or autoimmune hemolytic disorders. All participants will be screened for G6PD levels prior to registration\n* Patients who have an uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to any of the following:\n\n  * Have uncontrolled epilepsy\n  * Have an uncontrolled intercurrent illness\n  * Are pregnant or nursing\n  * Concurrent malignancy (outside of glioblastoma) that requires tumor directed treatment\n  * Known concurrent shingles, herpes, cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection\n  * Known concurrent opportunistic fungal infection\n  * Known immunodeficiency that could lead to opportunistic infections\n  * Psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements\n  * Any other illness or condition that the treating investigator feels would interfere with study compliance or would compromise the patient's safety or study endpoints\n* Patients who are pregnant or nursing. Pregnant patients are excluded from this study because temozolomide is an alkylating agent with potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with temozolomide, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with temozolomide\n* Patients who are unable to swallow oral medication or have problems/diseases that affect absorption or oral medication\n* Patients with a known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and/or hepatitis C virus (HCV). If patient does not have a known history testing will not be conducted\n\n  * Note: Temozolomide is an immunosuppressive agent. Patients with a known history of HIV, HBV, and HCV, and unexplained opportunistic infections are not eligible due to safety reasons",
