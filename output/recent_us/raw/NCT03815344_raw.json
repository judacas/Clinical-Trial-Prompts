Known primary prostate cancer and Grade Group 3 to 5 (≥ cT3) with one or more of the following:\n\n   1. Suspected extraprostatic disease (EPD) (extracapsular extension (ECE) and/or seminal vesicle infiltration (SVI)),\n   2. 3 or more biopsy cores of grade group 3-5;\n   3.

Ability to understand the requirements of the study and agree to abide by the study restrictions and to return for the required assessments\n6. Agree to use a medically acceptable method of birth control (e.g., spermicide in conjunction with a barrier such as a condom) or sexual abstinence for the duration of the study, including through final study visit (6 weeks) after the dose of study drug. Sperm donation is prohibited during the study and for 3 months after the dose of study drug. Female partners must use hormonal or barrier contraception unless postmenopausal or abstinent.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be MALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. The surgeon plans to perform an extraperitoneal approach\n2. History of anaphylactic reactions to products containing indocyanine green\n3.

Patients with QTc interval ≥ 470 msec per electrocardiogram (ECG) at screening.\n6. Significant acute or chronic medical, neurologic, or illness in the subject that, in the judgment of the Principal Investigator, could compromise subject safety, limit the ability to complete the study, and/or compromise the objectives of the study",
