    "official_title": "A Randomized, Double Blind, Vehicle-controlled Multicenter Phase III Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of BF-200 ALA (Ameluz®) and BF-RhodoLED® in the Treatment of Superficial Basal Cell Carcinoma (sBCC) With Photodynamic Therapy (PDT).",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Willingness and ability to sign the informed consent form and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) form. A study-specific informed consent form and a HIPAA form must be obtained in writing for all subjects prior to starting any study procedures.\n* Men or women ≥18 years of age.\n* Presence of ≥1 naïve sBCC lesion in the treatment areas face/forehead, bald scalp, extremities and/or neck/trunk, all of which are, according to the clinical judgement of the investigator, likely to be histologically confirmed as sBCCs. Lesions should not be within the embryonic fusion planes (H-zone), especially within 2 cm of the hair zone or on the ears. In case of multiple lesions, one lesion is defined as Main Target Lesion which will be excised at the end of the clinical observation period. Only eligible naïve sBCCs, confirmed by histology taken at screening, are allowed to be included in the study as Main or Additional Target Lesions. Thus, eligible sBCCs must lack any histological evidence of aggressive growth patterns (e.g. severe squamous metaplasia, infiltrative/desmoplastic features or basosquamous features). BCCs assessed as non-naïve (e.g. previously treated or recurrent) or non-eligible by biopsy taken at screening (and in a distance >5 cm from the next lesion included in the study) should be excised by surgery or removed by cryotherapy in a timely manner. Other treatments for these lesions are not allowed during the study.\n* The diameter of each eligible lesion should be ≥ 0.6 cm, and the entire treatment field must not exceed ~20 cm². The treatment field is defined as the field to which IMP is applied, usually including the target lesions and margins surrounding the lesions of up to 1 cm. For the Main Target Lesion, the maximal lesion size should be such that surgical excision without a skin transplant is feasible according to the investigator's judgement.\n* Target BCC lesions must be discrete and located within 1-2 illumination areas (the illumination area is defined by the effective illumination area of the BF-RhodoLED® device with approximately 6 x 16 cm).\n* Willingness to receive up to 4 PDTs within 3.5 months and excision of the Main Target Lesion either at Visit 5, if clinically cleared, or at the end of the clinical observation period 12 weeks after the start of the last PDT cycle (Visit 8), irrespective of whether the treated Main Target Lesion was clinically cleared or not.\n* Free of significant physical abnormalities (e.g. tattoos, dermatoses) within the potential treatment field plus a 5 cm radius surrounding the target lesion(s) as they may interfere with examination or final evaluation.\n* Willingness to stop the use of moisturizers and any other cosmetics within the treatment field plus a 5 cm radius surrounding the target lesion(s) 48 hours prior to an office visit and 48 hours after each PDT session. Sunscreen will be allowed, but should not be applied to the treatment field plus the 5 cm radius surrounding the target lesion(s) within approximately 24 h prior to a clinical visit.\n* Acceptance to abstain from extensive sunbathing and the use of a solarium during the clinical observation period. Subjects with sunburn within treatment areas cannot be included until fully recovered.\n* Healthy subjects and subjects with clinically stable medical conditions, including, but not limited to controlled hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, hypercholesterolemia, and osteoarthritis, will be permitted to be included in the study if their medication is not prohibited by this protocol.\n* Women of childbearing potential are permitted to participate in this study only if they have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening and are willing to use a highly effective method of contraception during the clinical observation period of the study.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* History of hypersensitivity to 5-ALA or any ingredient of BF-200 ALA which includes soybean phosphatidylcholine.\n* Hypersensitivity to porphyrins.\n* Current treatment with immunosuppression therapy.\n* Presence of photodermatoses.\n* Presence of porphyria.\n* Presence of clinically significant inherited or acquired coagulation defect.\n* Evidence of clinically significant (CS) unstable medical conditions, such as:\n\n  * Metastatic tumor or tumor with high probability of metastasis.\n  * Cardiovascular disease class III, IV (New York Heart Association [NYHA]).\n  * Immunosuppressive condition.\n  * Hematologic, hepatic, renal, neurologic, or endocrine condition.\n  * Collagen-vascular condition.\n  * Gastrointestinal condition.\n* Clinically relevant cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, neurologic, endocrine, or other major systemic diseases that complicate implementation of the protocol or interpretation of the study results.\n* Gorlin Syndrome or Xeroderma pigmentosum.\n* Presence and/or physical treatment of skin tumors other than (naïve) sBCC (e.g. malignant melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), Bowen's disease, aggressive BCC or nBCC diagnosed at the screening visit by clinical assessment) within a distance of ≤ 5 cm from the nearest target lesion within 4 weeks prior to PDT (Visit 2) until the end of the clinical observation period. However, biopsied lesion(s) that were not confirmed eligible at screening and which are located at a distance of > 5 cm from any lesion(s) that will be included in the study can be surgically removed. Treatment by PDT or topical medication during the course of the clinical observation period of the study triggers exclusion of the subject.\n* If lesion(s) are assessed as non-eligible by biopsy during initial screening and these lesions are localized within a distance of 5 cm from an otherwise suitable lesion, this suitable lesion must be excluded from the study.\n* Αny AK lesions within the treatment field (lesion area including margin of 0.5 to 1.0 cm).\n* Any topical medical treatment of AK, other non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC), or melanoma (except for IMP treatment of the target lesion(s)) starting 12 weeks prior to Visit 2 (PDT-1) and lasting until the end of the clinical observation period.\n* Any other topical medical treatment of the skin 12 weeks prior to Visit 2 (PDT-1) until the end of the clinical observation period, with the exception of:\n\n  * Topical treatments with corticosteroids (allowed throughout the clinical observation period of the study).\n  * Topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs such as diclofenac) (allowed throughout the clinical observation period of the study with the restriction of 7 days prior to and 7 days after PDTs).\n* Start of intake of medication with hypericin or systemically acting drugs with phototoxic or photoallergic potential within 8 weeks prior to screening.\n* Any of the systemic treatments listed below, within the designated period prior to PDT and during the clinical observation period.\n\n  * Interferon - 6 weeks\n  * Immunomodulators or immunosuppressive therapies - 12 weeks\n  * Cytotoxic drugs - 6 months\n  * Investigational drugs - 8 weeks\n  * Drugs known to have major organ toxicity - 8 weeks\n  * Corticosteroids (oral or injectable) - 6 weeks\n  * MAL or ALA - 12 weeks\n* Systemic treatment with NSAIDs is not to be used 7 days prior to and 7 days after PDT. ASA (e.g. Aspirin®) up to 100 mg/ day, ibuprofen up to 200 mg/ day, and acetaminophen (e.g. Tylenol®) is allowed during this period.\n* Presence of tattoos, skin inflammation, wounds, etc. in the treatment field(s) plus a 5 cm radius surrounding the target lesion(s).",
