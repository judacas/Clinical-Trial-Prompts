    "official_title": "A Single-center, Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, Three-way Crossover Phase I Study to Investigate the Effect on the QTc Interval of a Single Dose of AZD6094 (600 mg) Compared With Placebo, Using Open-label Moxifloxacin (Avelox®) as a Positive Control, in Healthy Volunteers",
    "inclusion_criteria": "Participants must fulfill the following criteria:\n\n1. Provision of signed and dated, written informed consent prior to any study specific procedure.\n2. Healthy vasectomized male participants with suitable veins for cannulation or repeated venipuncture, non-Japanese vasectomized male participants aged 18 to 55 years (inclusive) or male participants over 40 (and up to 55) years old not intending to father children.\n3. Body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 30 kg/m2 inclusive and weigh greater than 50 kg and no more than 100 kg.\n4. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and total bilirubin (TBL) less than or equal to the upper limit of normal for the institution.\n5. Have a calculated creatinine clearance (CrCL) greater than 80 mL/min using the Cockcroft-Gault formula at Screening.\n6. Provision of signed, written and dated informed consent for optional genetic/biomarker research. If a subject declines to participate in the genetic component of the study, there will be no penalty or loss of benefit to the subject. The subject will not be excluded from other aspects of the study described in this Clinical Study Protocol (CSP).\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be MALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 55 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "Participants must not be randomized if any of the following exclusion criteria are fulfilled:\n\n1. Healthy participants of Japanese ethnicity and any healthy subject that has 1 parent or grandparent (maternal or paternal) that is Japanese.\n2. History of any clinically important disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the Investigator, may either put the subject at risk because of participation in the study, or influence the results or the subject's ability to participate in the study.\n3. History or presence of gastrointestinal (GI), hepatic or renal disease or any other condition known to interfere with absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of drugs.\n4. Any clinically important illness, medical/surgical procedure or trauma within 4 weeks of the first administration of IMP.\n5. Planned in-patient surgery, dental procedure or hospitalization during the study.\n6. Any clinically important abnormalities in clinical chemistry, hematology or urinalysis results as judged by the Investigator.\n7. Any positive result on screening for serum hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).\n8. Abnormal vital signs, after 10 minutes supine rest, defined as any of the following:\n\n   - SBP < 90 mmHg or ≥ 140 mmHg; DBP < 50 mmHg or ≥ 90 mmHg; HR < 45 or > 85 beats per minute.\n9. Any clinically important abnormalities in rhythm, conduction or morphology of the 12-lead resting ECG that may interfere with the interpretation of QTc interval changes. These include healthy participants with any of the following:\n\n   * Abnormal ST-T-wave morphology, particularly in the protocol defined primary lead (V2) or left ventricular hypertrophy.\n   * PR interval shortening < 120 ms (PR > 110 ms but < 120 ms is acceptable if there is no evidence of ventricular pre-excitation).\n   * PR interval prolongation (> 200 ms). Intermittent second (Type 1 second degree block [Wenckebach Phenomenon] while asleep is not exclusive]) or third degree atrioventricular (AV) block, or AV dissociation.\n   * Persistent or intermittent complete bundle branch block (BBB), incomplete bundle branch block (IBBB), or intraventricular conduction delay (IVCD) with QRS > 110 ms. Participants with QRS > 110 ms but < 115 ms are acceptable if there is no evidence of e.g. ventricular hypertrophy or pre-excitation.\n   * Prolonged QTcF > 450 ms or shortened QTcF < 340 ms or family history of long QT syndrome.\n10. A history of additional risk factors for torsades de pointes (TdP) (e.g., heart failure, hypokalemia, family history of long QT syndrome or sudden death at young age).\n11. Known or suspected history of drug abuse as judged by the Investigator.\n12. Current smokers or those who have smoked or used nicotine products within the previous 30 days.\n13. History of alcohol abuse or excessive intake of alcohol as judged by the Investigator.\n14. Excessive intake of caffeine-containing drinks or food (e.g., coffee, tea, chocolate,) as judged by the Investigator.\n15. Use of drugs with enzyme inducing properties such as St John's Wort within 3 weeks prior to the first administration of the IMP.\n16. Any intake of grapefruit, grapefruit juice, Seville oranges, Seville orange marmalade, or other products containing grapefruit or Seville oranges within 7 days of the first admission on Day -1.\n17. Use of any prescribed or non-prescribed medication including antacids, analgesics (other than use of ibuprofen up to 72 hours before dosing day), herbal remedies, megadose vitamins (intake of 20 to 600 times the recommended daily dose) and minerals during the 2 weeks before the first administration of the IMP or longer (5 times half-life) if the medication has a long half-life. No medications known to prolong the QT/QTc interval are allowed.\n18. Positive screen for drugs of abuse, cotinine (nicotine) and/or alcohol at Screening and before each admission to the Clinical Unit.\n19. History of severe allergy/hypersensitivity (including allergy to fluoroquinolone antibiotics) or ongoing clinically important allergy/hypersensitivity, as judged by the Investigator.\n20. History of severe allergy/hypersensitivity or ongoing clinically important allergy/hypersensitivity, as judged by the Investigator or history of hypersensitivity to drugs with a similar chemical structure or class to AZD6094.\n21. Plasma donation within one month of Screening or any blood donation/blood loss > 500 mL during the 3 months prior to Screening.\n22. Has received another new chemical entity (defined as a compound which has not been approved for marketing) within 3 months of the first administration of investigational product in this study. The period of exclusion begins 3 months after the final dose or one month after the last visit whichever is the longest. Note: participants consented and screened, but not randomized in this study or a previous Phase I study, are not excluded.\n23. Involvement of any Astra Zeneca or study site employee or their close relatives.\n24. Judgment by the Investigator that the subject should not participate in the study if they have any ongoing or recent (i.e., during the screening period) minor medical complaints that may interfere with the interpretation of study data or are considered unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions and requirements.\n25. Participants who are vegans, vegetarians or have medical dietary restrictions.\n26. Participants who cannot communicate reliably with the Investigator.\n27. Vulnerable participants, e.g., kept in detention, protected adults under guardianship, trusteeship, or committed to an institution by governmental or juridical order.\n\n    In addition, any of the following is regarded as a criterion for exclusion from the genetic research:\n28. Previous bone marrow transplant.\n29. Non-leukocyte depleted whole blood transfusion within 120 days of the date of the genetic sample collection.",
