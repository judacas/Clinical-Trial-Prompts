History of such conditions at a body site other than the test areas is not exclusionary if in the opinion of the study medical provider it will not pose a risk to the subject.\n* Individuals who have had invasive cancer, chemotherapy or radiation therapy within five years of study enrollment\n* Individuals who are immunosuppressed by virtue of medication or disease. This includes AIDS patients, subjects taking oral steroids, and subjects on immunosuppressants/immunomodulators (cyclosporine, chemotherapeutic agents, or biologic therapy), as determined by the examining study medical provider.\n* Individuals with serious intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, psychiatric illness, or other situations that in the opinion of the examining study medical provider would limit compliance or interfere with the study regimen.\n* Individuals who have used photosensitizing drugs (see Appendix for examples) within 30 days of enrollment, or who will be using a photosensitizing drug during the time of the study, will not be eligible. Subjects may be reconsidered for eligibility 30 days after the last dose of such medications.\n* Individuals who have used any topical medication other than emollients or sunscreen/sunblock on the test area within 30 days prior to study enrollment. If a study participant requires topical medication to the test area during the study, they will be withdrawn from the study.\n* Individuals who have used retinoids, steroids, 5-fluorouracil, Levulan, Vaniqua (eflornithine), Solaraze, or Imiquimod (AldaraÂ®) anywhere on the body within 30 days prior to study enrollment. Subjects may be reconsidered for eligibility 30 days after the last topical treatment with such medications.\n* Individuals must not take mega-doses of vitamins. Mega-doses are defined as more than 5 capsules of standard multivitamins daily or more than the Tolerable Upper Intake Levels of Vitamins, as defined by the Institute of Medicine, National Academy of Sciences.
