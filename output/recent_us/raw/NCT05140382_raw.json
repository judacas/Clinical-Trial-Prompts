    "official_title": "An Open-label, Phase I/II Study to Assess the Safety and Clinical Activity of NKR-2 Treatment Administration After a Non-myeloablative Preconditioning Chemotherapy in Relapse/Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia or Myelodysplastic Syndrome Patients.",
    "inclusion_criteria": "1. The patient must have signed the written ICF and must accept that, beyond the treatment period, and the treatment follow-up period, he/she will have to be monitored for a Long-Term Safety Follow-Up (LTSFU) for up to 15 years after enrollment.\n2. Both men and women of all races and ethnic groups are eligible.\n3. The patient must be ≥ 18 and ≤ 75 years old at the time of signing the ICF.\n4. The patient must not be eligible for standard of care therapy and have one of the following hematological malignancy:\n\n4.a. A confirmed relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (i.e. ≥ 5% blasts in bone marrow or in peripheral blood) after at least one prior therapy defined as either\n\n* Recurrence of disease after a first complete remission (CR1) and not eligible for a second course of induction therapy, or\n* Recurrence of disease after a second complete remission (CR2), or\n* Failure to achieve CR after induction chemotherapy. Note: Patient with AML M3 are excluded. 4.b. A confirmed myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with:\n* Revised International Prognostic Scoring System (R-IPSS) criteria for Intermediate, High-risk or Very High-risk disease or refractory anemia with excess blasts by WHO (i.e. ≥ 5% blasts in bone marrow or ≥ 2% blasts in peripheral blood) or MDS with TP53 mutation as detected by next-generation sequencing (NGS).\n* Failure of prior treatment with at least 4 cycles of azacitidine or decitabine defined as no response to treatment, loss of response at any time point, or progressive disease/intolerance to therapy.\n\n  5. The absolute peripheral blast count should be < 15,000/L. 6. The patient must have evaluable disease defined by:\n* Revised Recommendations of the International Working Group for Diagnosis, Standardization of Response Criteria, for AML patients,\n* IWG 2006 Uniform Response Criteria for patients with Higher-Risk MDS. 7. The patient must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status below or equal to 2.\n\n  8. The patient must have adequate hepatic and renal functions as assessed by standard laboratory criteria 9. The patient must have a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of more than or equal to 40%, as determined by echocardiography or a multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan.\n\n  10. The patient must have a good pulmonary function with a Forced Expiratory Volume in the first second (FEV-1)/Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) more than or equal to 0.7 with FEV-1 more than or equal to 50% predicted (GOLD 1 or 2 severity) as determined by the spirometry performed at baseline , unless related to the AML/MDS disease as judged by the Investigator.\n\n  11. Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use effective contraception before, during and for at least 2 months after the last study treatment administration.\n\n  12. The patient must, in the opinion of the Investigator, be able to adhere with the study visit schedule and all study procedures described in this protocol.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 70 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. The patient has a confirmed or history of tumor involvement in the central nervous system (CNS).\n2. Patients who have received any cancer therapy (investigational agent or not), including but not limited to chemotherapy, small molecules, monoclonal antibodies (e.g., immune checkpoint blockade therapies), or radiotherapy within 2 weeks before the planned day for the apheresis (Day -21)\n3. Patients who are planned to receive, concurrently receiving or have received any investigational agent within 3 weeks before the planned day for the first NKR-2 administration (Day 1).\n4. Patient is under systemic immunosuppressive drugs, unless specific cases authorized per protocol.\n5. Patients who have received prior allogeneic stem cell transplantation or chimeric antigen receptor therapy.\n6. Patients who are presenting persistent toxicities greater than or equal to CTCAE grade 2 caused by previous cancer therapy (except for clinically non-significant toxicities, such as alopecia).\n7. Presence of any indwelling catheter or drain (e.g., percutaneous nephrostomy tube, indwelling foley catheter, biliary drain, or pleural/peritoneal/pericardial catheter) may be permissible unless they have a catheter-associated infection that cannot be cleared with antibiotics. Ommaya reservoirs and dedicated central venous access catheters such as a Port-a-Cath, peripherally inserted central catheter, or Hickman catheter are permitted.\n8. Patients who underwent major surgery within 4 weeks before the planned day for the first NKR-2 administration (Day 1).\n9. Patients who have received a live vaccine ≤ 6 weeks prior to each NKR 2 administration.\n10. Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness or serious uncontrolled medical disorder including, but not limited to evidence of active pneumonitis on screening chest imaging, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia history (or evidenced after the electrocardiogram planned at screening) and/or pronounced disturbances of the electrical conduction system of the heart, or significant thromboembolic events.\n11. Patients with significant disorder of coagulation or receiving treatment with warfarin derivatives or heparin.\n12. Patients who have active infections including, but not limited to viral, bacterial or fungal infections necessitating use of antibiotics/antivirals/antifungal treatment (prophylaxis is acceptable).\n13. Patients who are known to be positive or screened positive for hepatitis B (HBsAg positive) or C (anti-HCV positive).\n14. Patients who are known to be positive or screened positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).\n15. Patients with a family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency.\n16. Patients with a history of allergic reactions or hypersensitivity attributed to Human serum albumin or Plasma-lyte A.\n17. Patient with history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, organizing pneumonia, drug-induced pneumonitis, idiopathic pneumonitis and/or active or acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\n18.

Patients with Graves disease and vitiligo will be allowed.\n20. Patients with a history of a malignancy other than the one evaluated in this study enrollment, with exception of the following circumstances:\n\n    * Patients with a history of malignancy who have been adequately treated and have been disease-free for at least 1 year, and\n    * Patients with adequately treated active non-invasive cancers (such as non-melanomatous skin cancer or in-situ bladder, cervical and breast cancers).\n21.
