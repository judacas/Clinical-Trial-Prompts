Premature infants (born at 24 to <37 weeks of gestation with a birth weight ≥750g) require at least 80% of targeted energy requirements by PN at study entry (up to 1 month CA); full term infants and children require at least 70% of targeted energy requirements by PN at study entry\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 0 Years\nMust have maximum age of 17 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Patients who are not expected to survive hospitalization or with a severe critical unresponsive illness at time of initiation with foreseeable intercurrent events that could jeopardize the patient's participation in the study, as judged by the Investigator (e.g., unresponsive shock, sepsis, renal failure requiring dialysis, severe unresponsive metabolic acidosis, and/or severe unresponsive metabolic disorders);\n2. Patients with a known hypersensitivity to lipid emulsion, egg or soybean proteins, or any of the active substances, excipients, or components of the container or who have a history of an adverse event due to ILE;\n3. Patients with liver disease including cholestasis;\n4. Patients with severe hyperlipidemia or severe disorders of lipid metabolism characterized by hypertriglyceridemia (triglyceride >400 mg/dL);\n5. Patients who are unable to tolerate the necessary laboratory monitoring;\n6. Patients who are enrolled in another clinical trial involving an investigational agent;\n7. Patients with a known history of either severe hemorrhagic or severe hemolytic disease as judged by the investigator;\n8. Premature infants born <24 weeks of gestation and patients ≥18 years;\n9. Premature infants with a birth weight <750 g;\n10. Patient requires or is expected to require propofol for sedation;\n11.

Note: All female patients ≥12 years of age must have a negative urine human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) pregnancy test at screening. For female patients <12 years of age, a urine hCG test at screening will be performed at the discretion of the investigator based on childbearing potential.",
