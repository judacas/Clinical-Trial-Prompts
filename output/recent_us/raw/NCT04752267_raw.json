    "exclusion_criteria": "* Patients must not have any other malignancies within the past 2 years except for in situ carcinoma of any site, or adequately treated (without recurrence post-resection or post-radiotherapy) carcinoma of the cervix or basal or squamous cell carcinomas of the skin or active non-threatening second malignancy that would not, in the investigator's opinion, potentially interfere with the patient's ability to participate and/or complete this trial; examples include but not limited to: urothelial cancer grade Ta or T1, adenocarcinoma of the prostate treated by active surveillance\n* Patients currently receiving anticancer therapies or who have received anticancer therapies within 2 weeks (14 days) from enrollment into this study (including chemotherapy and targeted therapy) are excluded; also, patients who have completed palliative radiation therapy more than 14 days prior to the first dose of MGCD516 are eligible\n* Patients, who have had a major surgery or significant traumatic injury (injury requiring > 4 weeks [28 days] to heal) within 4 weeks (28 days) of start of study drug, patients who have not recovered from the side effects of any major surgery (defined as requiring general anesthesia) or patients that are expected to require major surgery during the course of the study\n* Patients who have been previously treated with mTOR inhibitors such as everolimus and temsirolimus, or with c-MET inhibitors such as cabozantinib\n* Patients who have organ allografts\n* Known or suspected autoimmune disease; patients with a history of inflammatory bowel disease (including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) and autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic progressive sclerosis (scleroderma), systemic lupus erythematosus or autoimmune vasculitis (e.g., Wegener's granulomatosis) are excluded from this study; patients with a history of Hashimoto's thyroiditis only requiring hormone replacement, type I diabetes, or psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger are allowed to participate\n* Known history of testing positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or known acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)\n* Any underlying medical condition, which in the opinion of the investigator, will make the administration of study drug hazardous or obscure the interpretation of adverse events, such as a condition associated with frequent diarrhea, uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, malabsorption syndrome or small bowel resection that may significantly alter the absorption of MGCD516\n* Patients must not have received prior anticancer therapy with any immune checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-CLTA-4, anti-PD1, or anti-PD-L1\n* Patients receiving any concomitant systemic therapy for renal cell cancer are excluded\n* Patients must not be scheduled to receive another experimental drug while on this study\n* Patients who are on high dose steroid (e.g., > 10 mg prednisone daily or equivalent) or other more potent immune suppression medications (e.g., infliximab); topical, inhaled, intra-articular, ocular, or intranasal corticosteroids (with minimal systemic absorption) are allowed; a brief course (=< 48 hours) of systemic corticosteroids for prophylaxis (e.g., from contrast dye allergy) is permitted\n* Patients who have any severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions or other conditions that could affect their participation in the study such as: symptomatic congestive heart failure of New York Heart Association class III or IV; unstable angina pectoris, symptomatic congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction within 6 months of start of study drug, serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia or any other clinically significant cardiac disease; severely impaired lung function as defined as oxygen (O2) saturation that is 88% or less at rest on room air; uncontrolled diabetes as defined by blood glucose > 200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/l); systemic fungal, bacterial, viral, or other infection that is not controlled (defined as exhibiting ongoing signs/symptoms related to the infection and without improvement) despite appropriate antibiotics or other treatment;
