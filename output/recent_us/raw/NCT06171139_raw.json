    "exclusion_criteria": "* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to study agent\n* Active diarrhea considered clinically significant and may impair oral drug administration\n* Clinically significant uncontrolled illness\n* Active infection requiring antibiotics\n\n  * Active infection.
