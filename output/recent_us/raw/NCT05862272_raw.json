    "exclusion_criteria": "* Clinical evidence of transformation to a more aggressive subtype of lymphoma or Grade 3B FL.\n* History of central nervous system lymphoma (either primary or metastatic).\n* Allogeneic stem cell transplant within the last 6 months, or active graft-versus-host disease following allogeneic transplant or autologous stem cell transplant within the last 3 months before the date of the first dose of study drug administration.\n* Use of any potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors or inducers within 14 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) before the first dose of study drug.\n* Prior treatment with a selective PI3Kδ inhibitor or a pan PI3K inhibitor.\n* Prior treatment with bendamustine (within 12 months of the start of study treatment). Subjects with prior bendamustine treatment (> 12 months before the start of study treatment) are eligible if they meet the following criteria:\n\n  * Did not discontinue because of tolerability concerns.\n  * Achieved either partial or CR to the bendamustine regimen of at least 12 months in duration before relapse/progression.\n  * Experienced progression following a regimen containing an alkylating agent.\n* Received prior obinutuzumab.\n* Received rituximab within 4 weeks of study start.\n* Prior treatment-related toxicities that have not resolved to ≤ Grade 1 before the date of study drug administration except for stable chronic toxicities (≤ Grade 2) not expected to resolve (eg, stable Grade 2 peripheral neurotoxicity).\n* Received any prior monoclonal antibody (except an anti-CD20 antibody) within 90 days before the date of study start.\n* History of severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions to monoclonal antibody therapy (eg, subjects in whom re-administration with rituximab would be contraindicated for safety reasons).",
