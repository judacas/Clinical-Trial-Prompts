Toxicities related to lapatinib if administered, should be =< grade 1 per the CTCAE v5.0, and the lapatinib must have been completed at least 2 weeks prior to study entry\n  * No history of intracranial hemorrhage or spinal cord hemorrhage\n  * No neurosurgical resection or brain biopsy within 10 days prior to study entry\n* After study entry and before randomization, send tissue for central HER2 confirmation; a tumor specimen obtained at the time of diagnosis of locally recurrent or metastatic disease must have been determined to be HER2-positive based on local testing according to American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists (ASCO/CAP) guidelines (Wolff 2018); HER2 status should initially be assessed using an Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared IHC assay; positive is defined as IHC 3+ staining intensity; if HER2 IHC results are equivocal (2+), then HER2 status will be determined using a FDA-cleared HER2 in situ hybridization (ISH) test according to ASCO/CAP guidelines; Note: Once HER2-positive is confirmed on central testing, patients will be randomized to atezolizumab/placebo; randomization within 14 days from study entry will ensure that the Pharmaceutical Management Branch (PMB)-supplied agents will be received at the site for treatment on day 22 of cycle 1\n* The tumor specimen obtained at the time of diagnosis used for HER2 testing must also have central testing for PD-L1 status; patients will be eligible irrespective of PD-L1 testing result including PD-L1 indeterminant\n* The tumor specimen obtained at the time of diagnosis used for HER2 and PD-L1 testing should also have central testing for estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PgR) according to current ASCO/CAP guideline recommendations for hormone receptor testing; patients with < 1% ER and PgR staining by IHC will be classified as negative; if enough material for central confirmation of ER and PgR is unavailable, local testing results for ER and PgR may be used for eligibility\n* Localized palliative radiation therapy to sites of non-measurable disease is allowed for symptom management and may begin prior to study entry and continue following study entry while receiving study therapy\n* Patients must have imaging of the chest/abdomen/pelvis, preferably with a CT scan, and a bone scan within 5 weeks prior to study entry;

neuroimaging is recommended but not required in asymptomatic patients\n* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) must be >= 1200/mm^3 (within 14 days prior to study entry)\n* Platelet count must be >= 100,000/mm^3 (within 14 days prior to study entry)\n* Hemoglobin must be >= 8 g/dL (within 14 days prior to study entry)\n* Total bilirubin must be =< 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) for the lab or direct bilirubin =< ULN for patients with bilirubin levels > 1.5 x ULN (within 14 days prior to study entry)\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransaminase (ALT) must be =< 2.5 x ULN for the lab or =< 5 x ULN for patients with liver metastases (within 14 days prior to study entry)\n* Serum creatinine =< 1.5 x ULN or measured or calculated creatinine clearance >= 50 mL/min using the Cockcroft-Gault formula for patients with creatinine levels > 1.5 x ULN for the lab (within 14 days prior to study entry)\n* Patients not receiving anti-coagulant therapy must have prothrombin time (PT) and international normalized ratio (INR) =< 1.5 x ULN within 14 days prior to study entry; for laboratories that do not report an ULN for the INR assay, use =< 1.5 as the value for the ULN; patients receiving anti-coagulants should have a baseline INR assessed, but the value does not affect eligibility\n* A serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and AM (preferably in morning) cortisol must be obtained within 14 days prior to study entry to obtain a baseline value; patients with abnormal TSH or AM cortisol baseline levels should be further evaluated and managed per institutional standards; asymptomatic patients who require initiation or adjustment of medication or are followed without initiating treatment based on endocrinologist's recommendations are eligible\n* Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) assessment must be performed within 6 weeks prior to study entry; (LVEF assessment performed by echocardiogram is preferred; however, multigated acquisition scan (MUGA) scan may be substituted based on institutional preferences); the LVEF must be >= 50% regardless of the cardiac imaging facility's lower limit of normal\n* Administration of atezolizumab may have an adverse effect on pregnancy and poses a risk to the human fetus, including embryo-lethality;
