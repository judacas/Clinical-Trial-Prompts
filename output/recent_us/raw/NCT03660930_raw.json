    "inclusion_criteria": "Participants eligible for inclusion in this study must meet all of the following criteria:\n\n* Male or female patients ≥ 18 years of age.\n* Participants with CML-CP within 3 months of diagnosis.\n* Diagnosis of CML-CP (ELN 2020 criteria) with cytogenetic confirmation of Philadelphia chromosome\n\nDocumented chronic phase CML will meet all the below criteria (Hochhaus et al 2020):\n\n* < 15% blasts in peripheral blood and bone marrow,\n* < 30% blasts plus promyelocytes in peripheral blood and bone marrow,\n* < 20% basophils in the peripheral blood,\n* Platelet count ≥ 100 x 10^9/L (≥ 100,000/mm^3),\n* No evidence of extramedullary leukemic involvement, with the exception of hepatosplenomegaly.\n\n  * Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.\n  * Adequate end organ function as defined by:\n* Total bilirubin < 3 x ULN; patients with Gilbert's syndrome may only be included if total bilirubin ≤ 3.0 x ULN or direct bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN\n* Creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥ 30 mL/min as calculated using Cockcroft-Gault formula,\n* Serum lipase ≤ 1.5 x ULN. For serum lipase > ULN - ≤ 1.5 x ULN, value must be considered not clinically significant and not associated with risk factors for acute pancreatitis\n\n  - Participants must have the following laboratory values within normal limits or corrected to within normal limits with supplements prior to randomization:\n* Potassium (potassium increase of up to 6.0 mmol/L is acceptable if associated with CrCl* ≥ 90 mL/min)\n* Total calcium (corrected for serum albumin); (calcium increase of up to 12.5 mg/dl or 3.1 mmol/L is acceptable if associated with CrCl* ≥ 90 mL/min)\n* Magnesium (magnesium increase of up to 3.0 mg/dL or 1.23 mmol/L if associated with CrCl* ≥ 90 mL/min)\n* For patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (CrCl* ≥ 30 mL/min and <90 mL/min) - potassium, total calcium (corrected for serum albumin) and magnesium should be ≥ LLN or corrected to within normal limits with supplements prior to randomization.\n* *CrCl as calculated using Cockcroft-Gault formula\n\n  * Ability to provide written informed consent prior to any study related screening procedures being performed.\n  * Evidence of typical BCR-ABL1 transcript [e14a2 and/or e13a2] at the time of screening which is amenable to standardized Real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) quantification.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 100 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Previous treatment of CML with any other anticancer agents including chemotherapy and/or biologic agents or prior stem cell transplant, with the exception of hydroxyurea and/or anagrelide. Treatment with either imatinib, or nilotinib, or dasatinib or bosutinib for ≤2 weeks is allowed, but no other treatment with other tyrosine kinase inhibitors prior to randomization is permitted.\n* Known cytopathologically confirmed CNS infiltration (in absence of suspicion of CNS involvement, lumbar puncture not required).\n* Impaired cardiac function or cardiac repolarization abnormality including but not limited to any one of the following:\n\n  * History within 6 months prior to starting study treatment of myocardial infarction (MI), angina pectoris, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)\n  * Clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias (e.g., ventricular tachycardia), complete left bundle branch block, high-grade AV block (e.g., bifascicular block, Mobitz type II and third degree AV block)\n  * QTc ≥ 450 ms (male patients), ≥460 ms (female patients) on the average of three serial baseline ECG (using the QTcF formula) as determined by central reading. If QTcF ≥ 450 ms and electrolytes are not within normal ranges, electrolytes should be corrected and then the patient re-screened for QTc.\n  * Long QT syndrome, family history of idiopathic sudden death or congenital long QT syndrome, or any of the following:\n  * Risk factors for Torsades de Pointes (TdP) including uncorrected hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, history of cardiac failure, or history of clinically significant/symptomatic bradycardia\n  * Concomitant medication(s) with a \"Known risk of Torsades de Pointes\" per www.crediblemeds.org/ that cannot be discontinued or replaced 7 days prior to starting study drug by safe alternative medication.•Inability to determine the QTcF interval\n* Severe and/or uncontrolled concurrent medical disease that in the opinion of the investigator could cause unacceptable safety risks or compromise compliance with the protocol (e.g. uncontrolled diabetes, active or uncontrolled infection; uncontrolled arterial or pulmonary hypertension, uncontrolled clinically significant hyperlipidemia). Please refer to Section 6.3.1\n* History of significant congenital or acquired bleeding disorder unrelated to cancer.\n* Major surgery within 4 weeks prior to study entry or who have not recovered from prior surgery.\n* History of other active malignancy within 3 years prior to study entry with the exception of previous or concomitant basal cell skin cancer and previous carcinoma in situ treated curatively\n* History of acute pancreatitis within 1 year prior to randomization or medical history of chronic pancreatitis.\n* History of chronic liver disease leading to severe hepatic impairment, or ongoing acute liver disease.\n* Known hypersensitivity to the study treatment\n\nOther protocol-defined Inclusion/exclusion criteria will apply.",
