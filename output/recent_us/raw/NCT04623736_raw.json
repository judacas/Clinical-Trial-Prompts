If prior EZH2 results are not available, tissue must be submitted. Tissue block is preferred but unstained slides are also acceptable. Patients who have insufficient or suboptimal tissue must be willing to have a biopsy performed prior to starting study drugs. See Correlative Lab Manual for details.\n* Demonstrate adequate organ function as defined below; all screening labs to be obtained within 28 days prior to registration.\n\n  * Hematological\n\n    * Platelets ≥ 50 K/dL\n    * Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) ≥ 1000 K/mm3\n    * Hemoglobin (Hgb) ≥ 8 g/dL\n  * Renal\n\n    * Calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 40 mL/min using the Cockcroft-Gault formula\n    * or Serum creatinine < 2 mg/dL\n  * Hepatic\n\n    * Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN)\n    * Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 3 × ULN\n    * Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 3 × ULN\n  * Coagulation ---International Normalized Ratio (INR) or Prothrombin Time (PT) Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) ≤ 2 × ULN\n* Females of childbearing potential with a male partner able to father a child must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 7 days prior to registration. See the protocol for definition of childbearing potential.\n* Females of childbearing potential must be willing to abstain from vaginal intercourse or use two effective methods of contraception from the time of informed consent, during the study and for 6 months after the last dose of study drug(s). Males able to father a child must be willing to abstain from vaginal intercourse or to use an effective method(s) of contraception from initiation of treatment, during the study and for 3 months after the last dose of study drug(s). See the protocol.\n* As determined by the enrolling physician or protocol designee, ability of the subject to understand and comply with study procedures for the entire length of the study.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Active infection requiring systemic therapy with 4 weeks of study drug administration.\n* Pregnant or breastfeeding (NOTE: breast milk cannot be stored for future use while the mother is being treated on study).\n* Concurrent malignancy or malignancy within the last 3 years (except for ductal breast cancer in situ, non-melanoma skin cancer, prostate cancer not requiring treatment, and cervical carcinoma in situ) whose natural history or treatment has the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen are not eligible for this trial. Any prior history of myeloid malignancies are excluded, regardless of when the subject was diagnosed, including myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN), prior history of T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL), T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), or B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL).\n* Active central nervous system (CNS) metastases or leptomeningeal disease. NOTE: Subjects who are symptomatic and have not undergone prior brain imaging must undergo a head computed tomography (CT) scan or brain MRI within 28 days prior to registration to exclude brain metastases.\n* Treatment with any investigational drug within 4 weeks prior to registration.\n* Subjects who require chronic use of moderate or strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors or inducers within 28 days prior to registration.\n* Clinically significant acute infection requiring systemic antibacterial, antifungal, or antiviral therapy.\n* Known Uncontrolled Human Immunodeficiency Virus infection. Testing not required. NOTE: If a subject is known to have HIV/AIDS, then they will be allowed on study with adequate antiviral therapy, no detectable viral load, and stable on antiviral treatment for ≥ 4 weeks prior to first dose of study drug(s).\n* Known hepatitis C infection. Testing not required. NOTE: If hepatitis C antibody test is known positive, patients are excluded unless a hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA) is negative.\n* Must be tested for hepatitis B within 28 days of registration: including hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B surface antibody, hepatitis B core antibody. A positive hepatitis B core antibody should be followed by hepatitis B DNA PCR testing to confirm or rule out active infection. Patients with hepatitis B surface antigen and/or detectable hepatitis B DNA PCR are not allowed on study. Patients with a positive hepatitis B core antibody but negative hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis B DNA PCR will be allowed on study, but hepatitis B prophylactic treatment should be strongly considered.\n* Clinically significant cardiovascular disease or cardiac insufficiency (New York Heart Association classes III-IV), cardiomyopathy, preexisting clinically significant arrhythmia, acute myocardial infarction within 3 months of enrollment, angina pectoris within 3 months of enrollment.",
