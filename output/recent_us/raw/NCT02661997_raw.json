    "official_title": "Phase 2, Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Sirukumab in Confirmed Severe or Critical COVID-19 Disease",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Hospitalized\n* Has laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection as determined by real time-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) at any time before randomization\n* Evidence of infiltrates by chest X-ray, chest computed tomography (CT), lung ultrasound, or chest auscultation (rales, crackles)\n* Informed consent must be obtained from the participant indicating that he or she understands the purpose of, and procedures required for, the study and is willing to participate in the study\n* Critical COVID-19 disease, defined as: Requires supplemental oxygen delivered by nonrebreather mask or high-flow nasal cannula or use of non-invasive or invasive ventilation or requiring treatment in an intensive care unit\n\n  1. AND corresponding to category 4 on the 6-point ordinal recovery scale, that is: requires one of the above modalities to sustain a peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) greater than (>) 93 percent (%) with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50% or higher. Note, the use of other devices may fit with category 4 if the FiO2 is 50% or higher.\n  2. OR, corresponding to category 5 on the 6-point ordinal recovery scale, that is partial pressure of oxygen in arterial per percentage of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) ratio < 300 millimeter of mercury (mmHg) while on invasive mechanical ventilation or veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for less than 48 hours prior to screening\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 84 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* On invasive mechanical ventilation or on veno-venous ECMO for >48 hours at time of screening\n* Received an investigational intervention (including investigational vaccines) or used an invasive investigational medical device within 30 days before the planned dose of study intervention. Note: the investigator must ensure that the participant is not enrolled in another COVID-19 study with an investigational intervention (apart from the exception specified below) prior to completion of Day 28 of the current study. Exception: participation in a single arm study, a non-blinded controlled study, expanded access, compassionate use program or any other program that is not a blinded study is allowed if it is conducted with one of the following: agents with demonstrated in vitro-effect against SARSCoV- 2, as mentioned in the center of disease control and prevention (CDC) guidelines and convalescent plasma\n* Current confirmed or high suspicion for pulmonary embolus, hemodynamic significant pericardial effusion, myocarditis, or Class 3 or 4 congestive heart failure as defined by the New York Heart Association Functional Classification AND/OR Current evidence of active cardiac ischemia\n* Has a history of respiratory condition (that is, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, fibrotic lung disease) that requires home oxygen supplementation, supportive non-invasive ventilation or, is status/post lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS). Exception: Participants with sleep apnea using supportive non-invasive ventilation (continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP]) at screening may be included\n* On renal replacement therapy (defined as peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis)\n* Screening laboratory test result as follows: absolute neutrophil count (ANC) <1.0*10^3 cells/microliter; Platelet count <50*10^3 cells/microliter; estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <=30 milliliter per minute per 1.73 square meter (mL/min/1.73 m^2); Bilirubin >2* upper limit of normal (ULN) unless bilirubin rise is due to Gilbert's syndrome or of non-hepatic origin; alanine aminotransferase/ aspartate aminotransferase (ALT) >5*ULN; Prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR) >1.5*ULN or activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) >1.5*ULN related to known coagulopathy or bleeding disorder (the participant can receive anticoagulant therapies for underlying conditions, or as systematic thromboprophylaxis due to COVID-19, or as part of the treatment of complications of COVID-19, but cannot participate in a clinical study with anticoagulants for COVID-19)\n* Pregnant or breastfeeding, unless in the opinion of the investigator, the benefit outweighs the risks\n* Has active hepatitis B or C infection or has human immunodeficiency virus infection or acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) based on medical history and/or concomitant medication\n* Known active or latent tuberculosis (TB), history of incompletely treated TB, suspected or known extrapulmonary TB based on medical history and/or concomitant medication\n* Evidence of active bacterial (including but not limited to bacterial pneumonia), fungal, viral or opportunistic infection (other than SARS-CoV-2)\n* Currently active clinically significant (example, causing hemodynamic instability and/or causing hypoxemia) and uncontrolled arrhythmia",
