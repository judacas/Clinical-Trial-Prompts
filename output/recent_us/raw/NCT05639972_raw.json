    "inclusion_criteria": "For Part 1:\n\n* Ability of the participant to understand the purpose and risks of the study and provide signed and dated informed consent and authorization to use confidential health information in accordance with national and local participant privacy regulations.\n* Diagnosis of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) according to the McDonald criteria [Thompson 2018].\n* Treatment with natalizumab as disease-modifying monotherapy for RRMS that is consistent with the approved dosing for a minimum of 12 months prior to randomization. The participant must have received at least 11 doses of natalizumab in the 12 months prior to randomization with no missed doses in the 3 months prior to randomization.\n* Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score <=5.5 at screening.\n* No relapses in the last 12 months prior to randomization, as determined by the enrolling Investigator.\n\nFor Part 2:\n\n* Ability of the participants to understand the purpose and risks of the study and provide signed and dated informed consent for Part 2 and authorization to use confidential health information in accordance with national and local participant privacy regulations.\n* Completed Part 1 Week 72 visit while remaining on their randomized treatment assignment of Q4W or Q6W.\n\nKey\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 60 Years",
