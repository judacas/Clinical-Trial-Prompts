    "official_title": "Neuroimaging Biomarkers of Impaired Neurocognitive Functioning After Cranial Proton Beam Radiotherapy For Treatment of Brain Tumors In Pediatric Patients",
    "inclusion_criteria": "Patients Treated for Brain Tumors:\n\n* The patient has been diagnosed with a primary or metastatic brain tumor\n* The patient has been recommended to receive cranial PBRT for a primary or metastatic brain tumor\n* The patient is between the ages of 6 through 25 at time of consent\n* As per medical record or patient report (based on prior tolerance of MRI), the participant is able to tolerate MRI without sedation (i.e., general anesthesia). Patients will take medications as prescribed or directed by the patient's physician. If in accordance with their prescribed regimen, agents that may impact the CNS, such as benzodiazepines and/or antihistamines, should be avoided on the day of imaging and neurocognitive assessment.\n\nHealthy Control Participants:\n\n* The control has no major medical illness, as determined by medical interview by study physician\n* As per parent report, the control is between the ages of 6 through 25 at time of consent\n* As per parent report, the control is able to tolerate an MRI without sedation (i.e., general anesthesia). Participants should only take medications as prescribed or directed by their physician. They should not take additional medications, such as antihistamines, for the purpose of tolerating MR imaging.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 6 Years\nMust have maximum age of 25 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* As per self or parent report, the participant has completed any portion of the neuropsychological battery used in this study within the last year.\n* As per medical record or self or parent report, there is an existing diagnosis of intellectual disability and/or prior IQ testing that documents Full Scale IQ standard score <70 at baseline.\n* As per medical record, there is an existing diagnosis of psychiatric disorder or untreated mood disturbance, prior stroke or intracranial hemorrhage, or neurodegenerative disease.\n* The participant has an MRI contraindication (e.g., implanted ferromagnetic devices, claustrophobia) as per radiology clinical operating procedures.\n* As per self or parent report, non-fluency in English language as demonstrated by current educational placement in a non-English-speaking classroom setting.",
