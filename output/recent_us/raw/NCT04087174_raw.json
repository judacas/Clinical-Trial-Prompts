    "official_title": "Feasibility and Effectiveness of an Innovative Exercise Program to Reduce Fatigue in Rural Cancer Survivors",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Adult (>= 18 years) cancer survivor.\n\n  * A maximum age of 80 will be set as virtual exercise may become unsafe as individuals get older.\n* A cancer diagnosis of any type\n\n  * CRF is a common symptom across cancer types and the current CRF reference chart was developed using data from patients with all cancer types.\n* Current report of moderate-to-severe fatigue (> 3 on a 0-10 scale, per NCCN definition31)\n* Live in rural Colorado and surrounding areas (> 1-hour commute to major front range city [Denver, Fort Collins, and Colorado Springs])\n\n  * This program attempts to target individuals in Colorado and surrounding areas with restricted access to fitness centers that may offer cancer specific services, most likely found in major front range cities. We have defined rural in terms of commute time to these cities, as it is the commute to these centers that restricts access.\n* Completed medical cancer treatment (chemotherapy and/or radiation) with curative intent within past 12 months or currently on treatment with no planned changes for the next 4 months (e.g. maintenance or palliative therapy).\n\n  * No additional treatment planned for next 4 months.\n  * These restrictions are made to ensure the validity of tracking changes with the established reference chart, which was developed using data from cancer survivors who had recently completed therapy or were on therapy14. It is unclear how fatigue response to exercise may change in survivors further out from treatment completion.\n* High-speed home internet and smartphone (or laptop with camera).\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 80 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "- Medical conditions that would impact the safety of, or participation in, an exercise program. This includes:\n\n* Orthopedic conditions such as advanced osteoarthritis, mobility-limiting amputations or chronic injuries, or mobility- limiting acute orthopedic injuries\n* Advanced rheumatoid arthritis\n* Widespread chronic pain conditions such as fibromyalgia\n* Significant balance impairment increasing the risk of falling\n* Pulmonary conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, emphysema, interstitial lung disease, use of supplemental oxygen\n* Known cardiovascular disease, uncontrolled hypertension, or new cardiac event within the past 6 months.",
