FCBP must refrain from breastfeeding and donating oocytes during the course of the study. Males must use an effective barrier method of contraception without interruption during the study and continue for at least 12 weeks after the last dose of selinexor and CS. They must refrain from donating sperm during the study participation.\n* *FCBP defined as sexually mature women who have not undergone bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or hysterectomy; or who have not been postmenopausal (i.e., who have not menstruated at all) for at least 1 year\n\n  * Highly effective forms of birth control are methods that achieve a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly. Highly effective forms of birth control include: hormonal contraceptives (oral, injectable, patch, and intrauterine devices), male partner sterilization, or total abstinence from heterosexual intercourse, when this is the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient NOTE: The double-barrier method (e.g., synthetic condoms, diaphragm, or cervical cap with spermicidal foam, cream, or gel), periodic abstinence (such as calendar, symptothermal, post-ovulation), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), lactational amenorrhea method, and spermicide-only are not acceptable as highly effective methods of contraception\n\n    * Provide written informed consent\n    * Willing to return to enrolling institution for follow-up (during the Active Monitoring Phase of the study)\n    * Willingness to provide mandatory blood specimens per protocol for Pharmacokinetics (PKs) and banking\n    * For lymphoma, extramedullary myeloma and histiocytic/dendritic cell neoplasms, willing to provide mandatory tissue samples for correlative research.
