Demonstrate adequate hepatic, renal, and bone marrow function as defined below; all hematological, renal, and hepatic screening labs should be performed within 10 days prior to \"on study\" status (alpha gal testing must be within the regular screening period).\n\n   * Absolute lymphocyte count ≥ 400/mm3\n   * Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,000/mm3\n   * Platelets ≥ 75,000/mm3\n   * Hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL\n   * Serum creatinine OR Measured or calculated creatinine clearance (GFR can also be used in place of creatinine or CrCl) < 2.0 mg/dl OR ≥50 ml/mm\n   * Serum total bilirubin ≤ 2 mg/dl (biliary stent is allowed)\n   * AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) < 5.0 times normal\n   * Alpha 1,3 Galactose IgE (\"alpha gal\") < 0.35 IU/ml or \"negative\"\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Known hypersensitivity to cetuximab or other EGFR antibody\n2. Treatment with any investigational agent within 14 days prior to first study intervention (apheresis) for protocol therapy\n3. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to first study intervention (apheresis). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment.\n4. Serious non-healing wound, ulcer, bone fracture, major surgical procedure, open biopsy or significant traumatic injury within 28 days prior to \"on-study\" status\n5. Active liver disease such as cirrhosis, chronic active hepatitis or chronic persistent hepatitis\n6. Is HIV positive or has evidence of active Hepatitis C virus or active Hepatitis B virus. If initial Hepatitis C test shows a positive result, the patient should have a Hepatitis viral load test to confirm. If initial HIV or Hepatitis B virus testing shows a positive result, no further testing will be done.\n7. Active bleeding or a pathological condition that is associated with a high risk of bleeding (therapeutic anticoagulation is allowed)\n8. Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy\n9. A serious uncontrolled medical disorder that in the opinion of the Investigator may be jeopardized by the treatment with protocol therapy\n10. Has a known history of active TB (Bacillus Tuberculosis)\n11. Has had prior chemotherapy, radiation, hormonal, monoclonal antibody (mAb) or targeted small molecule therapy, within 2 weeks prior to the first study procedure (apheresis). Subjects who have not recovered to <Grade 3 from an adverse event due to a previously administered agent are not eligible.\n12. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of first study procedure (apheresis).\n13. History of a recent myocardial infarction (within one year), a past myocardial infarction (more than one year ago) along with current coronary symptoms requiring medications.\n14. Has history of another malignancy within the past 5 years. Exceptions include\n\n    * basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy\n    * in situ cervical cancer.\n15. Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment.\n16. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.\n17.
