NOTE: Females are considered of child bearing potential unless they are surgically sterile (have undergone a hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or are postmenopausal (at least 12 consecutive months with no menses without an alternative medical cause)\n* FCBP must be willing to use a highly effective contraceptive method (i.e., achieves a failure rate of < 1% per year when used consistently and correctly) from the time of informed consent until 3 months after treatment discontinuation. Male subjects must be willing to use condoms from the time of informed consent until 3 months after treatment discontinuation. For a non-pregnant FCBP partner, contraception recommendations should also be considered\n* Presence of neoplastic disease documented on imaging studies (bone scan, CT and/or MRI scans) deemed accessible for serial biopsies (including bone and soft tissues)\n* Patients must agree to tissue collection for correlative studies (including participation in PA13-0291 and PA13-0247 laboratory protocols, and archival tissue from a prior biopsy or surgery for prostate cancer where available)\n* Ability to swallow and retain oral medications\n* Ability to understand and willingness to sign an Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved written informed consent form (ICF) and authorization permitting release of personal health information including genetic testing relevant to cancer\n* Ability to comply with study visit schedule and assessments\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",

Subjects with vitiligo, type I diabetes mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only requiring hormone replacement, psoriasis or eczema not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger are permitted to enroll\n* Requires chronic systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (> 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications. Inhaled, intranasal, intra-articular and topical (including ocular) steroids are allowed. Adrenal replacement (i.e., physiologic replacement) doses > 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease\n* History of interstitial lung disease, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or evidence of active pneumonitis on screening chest computed tomography (CT) scan\n* Clinically significant cardiovascular disease including:\n\n  * Myocardial infarction (MI)/stroke within 6 months prior to day 1 of study treatment\n  * Unstable angina within 3 months prior to day 1 of study treatment\n  * Congestive heart failure (CHF) with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class 3 or 4\n  * History of clinically significant ventricular arrhythmias (e.g., ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, torsades de pointes)\n  * Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure [BP] >= 140 mmHg or diastolic BP >= 90 mmHg). Patients with a history of hypertension are allowed provided blood pressure is controlled by anti-hypertensive treatment\n  * Baseline 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) that demonstrates clinically relevant abnormalities that may affect participant safety or interpretation of study results (eg, baseline corrected QT [QTc] interval > 470 msec, complete left bundle branch block [LBBB], signs of an acute myocardial infarction, ST-T interval changes suggestive of active myocardial ischemia, second- or third-degree atrioventricular [AV] block, or serious bradyarrhythmias or tachyarrhythmias). If the baseline uncorrected QT interval is > 470 msec, this interval should be rate-corrected using the Fridericia method and the resulting Fridericia's correction formula (QTcF) should be used for decision making and reporting. If QTc exceeds 470 msec, or QRS exceeds 120 msec, the ECG should be repeated 2 more times and the average of the 3 QTc or QRS values should be used to determine the participant's eligibility. Computer-interpreted ECGs should be over read by a physician experienced in reading ECGs before excluding participants. Cases must be discussed in detail with the principal investigator (PI) to judge eligibility\n* Known active infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) screening will include hepatitis B surface antigen (HepBsAg) and HCV antibody (Ab).
