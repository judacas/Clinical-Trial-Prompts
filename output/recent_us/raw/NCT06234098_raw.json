    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Chemotherapy, biological therapy, immunotherapy, radical radiotherapy, targeted therapy (including small molecule inhibitor of tyrosine kinase), and other antitumor therapy within 2 weeks or 5 half-lives (whichever is shorter) prior to the first administration; major surgery within 4 weeks prior to the first administration; mitomycin and nitrosoureas treatment within 6 weeks prior to the first administration\n2. Subjects with history of severe heart disease\n3. Subjects with prolonged QT interval (QTc >470 msec), complete left bundle branch block, Grade 3 atrioventricular block\n4. Active autoimmune diseases and inflammatory diseases\n5. Other malignant tumors diagnosed within 5 years prior to the first administration considered to be in remission\n6. Subjects with poorly controlled hypertension by two kinds of antihypertensive drugs (systolic blood pressure >150 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure >100 mmHg)\n7. Subjects who have Grade 3 lung disease or a history of interstitial lung disease\n8. Deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism unless under adequate anticoagulant treatment\n9. Patients with primary tumors in the central nervous system (CNS) and active or untreated CNS metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis should be excluded. Patients with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are clinically stable for at least 4 weeks and have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases and no requirements for corticosteroids 14 days prior to dosing with the investigational product (IP). Patients on low dose corticosteroids (<20 mg prednisone or equivalent/day) may participate.\n10. Subjects who have a history of allergies to recombinant humanized antibodies or human-mouse chimeric antibodies or any of the components of BL M07D1\n11. Subjects who have a history of autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation\n12. Has received treatment with anthracyclines with a cumulative dose exceeding 360 mg/m2\n13. Known human immunodeficiency virus antibody (HIVAb) positive, active tuberculosis, active hepatitis B virus infection (HBV-DNA copy number > the lower limit of detection) or active hepatitis C virus infection (HCV antibody positive and HCV-RNA > the lower limit of detection)\n14. Subjects with active infections requiring systemic treatment, such as severe pneumonia, bacteremia, sepsis, etc.\n15. Participated in another clinical trial within 4 weeks or two half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to first dose of study treatment\n16. Other conditions that the investigator believes are not suitable for participating in this clinical trial.",
