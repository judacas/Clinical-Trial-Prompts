    "official_title": "Adaptive Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy to the Prostate and Pelvic Nodes With Simultaneous Integrated Boost to the MR-detected Nodule for Patients With High-risk and Unfavorable Intermediate-risk Prostate Cancer",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Pathologically proven adenocarcinoma of the prostate with NCCN high-risk disease or NCCN unfavorable intermediate-risk disease.\n* Patients with unfavorable intermediate-risk disease must meet the following criteria:\n\n  * At least one intermediate risk factor (IRF):\n\n    * PSA 10-20 ng/mL\n    * cT2b-c (AJCC 8th ed.)\n    * Gleason score 7\n  * At least one \"unfavorable\" intermediate-risk identifier:\n\n    * > 1 IRF\n    * Gleason score 4+3\n    * ≥ 50% of biopsy cores positive\n  * NO high-risk features\n* Patients with high-risk disease must meet at least one of the following criteria:\n\n  * cT3a-T3b\n  * PSA > 20\n  * Gleason score ≥ 8\n* MRI scan of the prostate with at least one MR-detectable lesion in the prostate/seminal vesicles. PET/CT which is found to display activity n the prostate consistent with prostate cancer may be substituted per investigator discretion.\n* Planning to undergo concurrent whole-pelvis SBRT and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). ADT may be initiated at any time per institutional standard, so long as ADT begins within 60 days of the start of radiotherapy.\n* At least 18 years of age.\n* ECOG performance status ≤ 1\n* Agreement to adhere to Lifestyle Considerations throughout study duration\n* Able to complete relevant patient-reported quality-of-life questionnaires in the opinion of the treating physician.\n* Able to understand and willing to sign an IRB approved written informed consent document.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be MALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Definitive radiologic evidence of nodal (cN+) or metastatic (cM1) disease on conventional imaging (bone scan) or prostate cancer-specific PET/CT scan (NaF PET/CT, Axumin PET/CT, fluciclovine, choline, or PSMA PET/CT scan). Patients with lymph nodes ≥ 1 cm on short axis are ineligible unless the lymph node is read as benign by Radiology.\n* Prior androgen deprivation therapy. (If the onset of androgen ablation is ≤ 60 days prior to treatment start, the patient is eligible.) Baseline PSA and testosterone must be obtained prior to start of treatment.\n* Systemic chemotherapy within 3 years prior to treatment start.\n* Prior radical prostatectomy, pelvic lymph node dissection, prostate cryotherapy, or high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) to the prostate.\n* Prior pelvic radiotherapy.\n* Presence of baseline CTCAE grade ≥ 2 GI or GU toxicity that does not resolve to grade 1 or less with appropriate intervention.\n* cT4 disease.\n* American Urologic Association (AUA) urinary symptom score ≥ 20\n* Prostate gland measuring >90 cc.\n* Unable to get prostate fiducial markers placed for image guided radiation treatment. Rectal hydrogel is optional and is left to the discretion of the treating physician.\n* Hip prosthetic that does not allow for treatment planning visualization.\n* Prior malignancy (except for non-melanoma skin cancer) unless disease-free for at least 2 years. Patients are not eligible if they have had a prior pelvic malignancy (e.g. bladder cancer, rectal cancer).\n* Prior transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) within 3 months prior to registration.\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness precluding RT and/or ADT including, but not limited to, seizures, myocardial infarction in the past 6 months, current severe or unstable angina pectoris, congestive heart failure requiring hospitalization in the past 6 months, uncontrolled active infection, uncontrolled hypertension, or any condition that in the opinion of the investigator would preclude participation in the study.\n* History of uncontrolled inflammatory bowel disease, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.\n* Presence of anal fissure or history of bowel or bladder fistula.\n* Scleroderma. Patients who are moderately symptomatic from other autoimmune diseases or patients on biologic therapies for autoimmune diseases are also excluded.\n* Known history of HIV or chronic hepatitis B or C. Testing to evaluate for the presence of HIV and/or hepatitis B or C is not required in patients who do not carry the diagnosis.\n* Poorly visualized bladder and bowel on diagnostic CT or CT simulation (either due to body habitus or artifact).\n* Unable to spend 30 minutes lying on the radiation therapy treatment couch due to significant urinary frequency/urgency or other comorbidities.",
