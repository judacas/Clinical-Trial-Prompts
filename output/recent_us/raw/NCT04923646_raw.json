    "inclusion_criteria": "* Have histologically or cytologically confirmed, advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), characterized by either epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) Exon 19 deletion (Exon 19del) or Exon 21 leucine 858 to arginine substitution (Exon 21 L858R) mutation by an Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved or other validated test of either circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA) or tumor tissue in a clinical laboratory improvement amendments (CLIA) certified laboratory (sites in the United Started [US]) or an accredited local laboratory (sites outside of the US)\n* Have progressed on or after osimertinib (or another approved 3rd generation epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR] tyrosine kinase inhibitor [TKI]) and platinum-based chemotherapy (irrespective of order). a) The 3rd generation EGFR TKI must have been administered as the first EGFR TKI for metastatic disease or as the second TKI after prior treatment with first- or second-generation EGFR TKI in participants with metastatic EGFR T790M mutation positive NSCLC. b) Participants who decline or are otherwise ineligible for chemotherapy may be enrolled after discussion with the medical monitor. c) Any adjuvant or neoadjuvant treatment, whether with a 3rd generation EGFR TKI or platinum based chemotherapy, would count towards the prior treatment requirement if the participant experienced disease\n* Have at least 1 measurable lesion, according to response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) version 1.1\n* Have an eastern cooperative oncology group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1\n* Any toxicities from prior anticancer therapy must have resolved to common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE) Version 5.0 Grade 1 or baseline level (except for alopecia [any grade], Grade less than or equal to (<=) 2 peripheral neuropathy, and Grade <=2 hypothyroidism stable on hormone replacement)\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Participant has received cytotoxic, investigational, or targeted therapies beyond one regimen of platinum-based chemotherapy and EGFR inhibitors\n* Participant has received radiotherapy for palliative purposes less than 7 days prior to randomization\n* Participant has symptomatic or progressive brain metastases\n* Participant has leptomeningeal disease, or participant has spinal cord compression not definitively treated with surgery or radiation\n* Participant has uncontrolled tumor-related pain\n* Participant has a medical history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), including drug-induced ILD or radiation pneumonitis",
