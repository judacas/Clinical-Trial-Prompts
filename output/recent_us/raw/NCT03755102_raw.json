    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1.\n2. Dazostinag SA (dose escalation Part 1A):\n\n   o With histologically confirmed (cytological diagnosis is acceptable) advanced or metastatic solid tumors that have no standard therapeutic options or are intolerant to these therapies.\n3. Dazostinag in combination with pembrolizumab (dose escalation Parts 1B and Japan safety lead-in):\n\n   * With histologically confirmed (cytological diagnosis is acceptable) advanced or metastatic solid tumors that have no standard therapeutic options or are intolerant to them, including:\n   * Tumors that have relapsed or are refractory to anti-programmed cell death ligand protein 1 (anti PD-(L)-1) therapy.\n   * Tumors that are naive to anti-PD-(L)-1 therapy.\n4. For expansion phase only:\n\n   * SCCHN (Part 2):\n   * Participants with histologically confirmed (cytological diagnosis is acceptable) metastatic or recurrent, unresectable SCCHN that is considered incurable by local therapies. Participants should not have had prior systemic therapy administered in the recurrent or metastatic setting. Systemic therapy which was completed more than 6 months before signing consent if given as part of multimodal treatment of locally advanced disease is allowed.\n   * Anatomic subsites to be included are oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, larynx, nasal cavity, and paranasal sinuses (maxillary, ethmoid, sphenoid, and frontal). The exception to this is nasopharyngeal cancer and salivary gland tumors, which will not be included.\n   * Participants with oropharyngeal cancer or tumors arising in the paranasal sinuses (maxillary, ethmoid, sphenoid, and frontal) must agree to provide archival tissue for human papilloma virus (HPV) testing or if known, HPV testing results (using CINtec® p16 Histology assay is preferred but not required) and a 70% cutoff point must be provided. Alternatively, archival tissue or a fresh excisional or core needle biopsy (≥ 2 cores) is required for the determination of HPV status. If HPV status was previously tested using this method (CINtec® p16 Histology assay is preferred but not required), no additional testing is required. Archival tissue can be obtained up to 90 days prior to screening. Samples that are older than 90 days at screening may be used after consultation with the sponsor.\n   * For Part 2A, tumors must have a PD-L1 CPS ≥ 1. Participants must agree to provide fresh tumor biopsy for analysis from a core or excisional biopsy (fine needle aspirate is not sufficient) at screening for PD-L1 CPS assessment by a central laboratory. This specimen may be the diagnostic sample for participants with a new diagnosis of metastatic SCCHN. Participants for whom newly obtained samples cannot be obtained (eg, inaccessible or participant safety concern) may submit an archived specimen only upon agreement from the Sponsor. Archival tissue can be obtained up to 90 days prior to screening provided there was no other treatment from the time of biopsy until the start of study treatment. For Part 2B, any CPS is eligible but fresh or archival tissue is required for confirmation of CPS status. Collection of the tissue samples for PD-L1 assessments for Part 2B can be discontinued by the sponsor if sufficient data has been collected or dazostinag activity does not justify further collection.\n   * For Part 2B, participants must be eligible to receive treatment with either cisplatin or carboplatin in combination with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) per the treating physician.\n5. CRC (Part 3):\n\n   * Third-line or later MSI-H/dMMR CRC (Part 3A): Participants with histologically confirmed (cytological diagnosis is acceptable) recurrent locally advanced or metastatic MSI-H/dMMR CRC whose disease has progressed on or following therapy with 1) an anti-PD-1 or PD-L1 antibody (i.e., pembrolizumab) and 2) at least one line of combination chemotherapy including a fluoropyrimidine and irinotecan OR oxaliplatin with or without an anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFR) monoclonal antibody (i.e., cetuximab or bevacizumab). MSI-H/dMMR CRC participants must have received at least 6 weeks of prior treatment with an anti-PD-(L)-1 antibody. Only one line of anti-PD-(L)-1 is permitted.\n   * Third-line MSS/pMMR CRC (Part 3B): Participants with histologically confirmed (cytological diagnosis is acceptable) recurrent locally advanced or metastatic MSS/pMMR CRC whose disease has progressed on or following therapy with 2 different lines of combination chemotherapy, including therapy with a fluoropyrimidine and irinotecan AND therapy with a fluoropyrimidine and oxaliplatin. Both lines of therapy may be given with or without an anti-EGFR or anti-VEGFR monoclonal antibody (i.e., cetuximab or bevacizumab).\n\n   Participants with MSS/pMMR CRC must have progressed on or after combination chemotherapy regimens containing BOTH irinotecan AND oxaliplatin.\n   * Participants with MSI-H/dMMR or MSS/pMMR CRC must have documented MSI/MMR status assessed by a Clinical Laboratory Improvements Amendment-certified (United States [US] sites or an accredited (outside of the US) local laboratory using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or next generation sequencing (NGS) assay.\n   * Adequate tumor tissue available for central laboratory confirmation of MSI/MMR status. Note: confirmation of central test positivity is not required before treatment.\n   * Participants with MSI-H/dMMR or MSS/pMMR CRC must have been treated with 2 prior lines of therapy in the recurrent locally advanced or metastatic setting.\n6. Adequate bone marrow, renal, hepatic and cardiac functions.\n7. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) > 50%, as measured by echocardiogram or multiple-gated acquisition (MUGA) scan within 4 weeks before receiving the first dose of study drug.\n8. Clinically significant toxic effects of previous therapy have recovered to Grade 1 (per NCI CTCAE Version 5.0) or baseline, except for alopecia, Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy, and/or autoimmune endocrinopathies with stable endocrine replacement therapy.\n9. In dose escalation Part 1, (not applicable for the Japan safety lead-in) once peripheral evidence of dazostinag pharmacodynamic stimulation of the innate and/or adaptive immune system is observed in the blood and/or an imaging response/partial response (CR/PR) is observed in at least 1 participant, subsequent participants must:\n\n   * Have at least 1 lesion amenable for biopsy.\n   * Agree to have 2 tumor biopsies: 1 during the screening period and 1 while on dazostinag treatment.\n10. Must have at least 1 RECIST version 1.1-evaluable (measurable) lesion. For the dose escalation phase (Part 1) only, nonmeasurable only disease is acceptable.\n11. Pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic blood must be drawn on a peripherally-inserted catheter. Dazostinag is preferentially administered through a central line, but peripheral infusion is acceptable. If a peripheral line is used for dazostinag and/or pembrolizumab infusion, it must be separate than the one used for PK/pharmacodynamic collection.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
