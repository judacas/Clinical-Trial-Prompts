    "official_title": "Impact of Behavior Modification Interventions and Lung Cancer Screening on Smoking Cessation in People Living With HIV: A Feasibility Study",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Able to understand and willing to sign a written informed consent document\n* HIV positive. Documentation of HIV-1 infection by means of any one of the following:\n\n  * Documentation of HIV diagnosis in the medical record by a licensed health care provider;\n  * Documentation of receipt of antiretroviral therapy (ART) (at least two different medications that do not constitute a prescription for pre-exposure prophylaxis [PrEP] or post-exposure prophylaxis [PEP]) by a licensed health care provider. Documentation may be a record of an ART prescription in the participant's medical record, a written prescription in the name of the participant for ART, or pill bottles for ART with a label showing the participant's name;\n  * HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) detection by a licensed HIV-1 RNA assay demonstrating > 1000 RNA copies/mL;\n  * Any licensed HIV screening antibody and/or HIV antibody/antigen combination assay confirmed by a second licensed HIV assay such as a HIV-1 Western blot confirmation or HIV rapid multispot antibody differentiation assay.\n\nNote: The term \"licensed\" refers to a kit that has been certified or licensed by an oversight body within the participating country and validated internally (e.g., U.S. Food and Drug Administration [FDA]).\n\nWHO (World Health Organization) and CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) guidelines mandate that confirmation of the initial test result must use a test that is different from the one used for the initial assessment. A reactive initial rapid test should be confirmed by either another type of rapid assay or an E/CIA that is based on a different antigen preparation and/or different test principle (e.g., indirect versus competitive), or a Western blot or a plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load\n\n* Receiving antiretroviral therapy and CD4 count at least 200 cells/uL within 6 months of registration (due to increased risk of LDCT false positivity with CD4 count < 200cells/uL)\n* Age 45-80 years. This age restriction reflects lung cancer risk and appropriateness for lung cancer screening; in epidemiologic studies lung cancer emerges 5-10 years earlier in PLWH, and therefore this is an appropriate risk group for screening. Although younger persons are likely to benefit more from smoking cessation as a lung cancer prevention measure, the risk/benefit ratio associated with lung cancer screening is unlikely to be optimal at ages < 45 years for PLWH\n* Biochemically confirmed current smoker (exhaled carbon monoxide [CO] >= 7 parts per million)\n* Meets United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) criteria for LDCT (age 50-80 and >= 20 pack-years smoking) or high-risk but not meeting USPSTF (age 45-49 and >= 20 pack-years smoking)\n* Possession of a smartphone that can support Positively Smoke Free Mobile (PSF-M) (> 95% of subjects had eligible phones in prior trials although researchers will include specific study screening questions assessing for adequate smartphone for the intervention)\n* Sufficient literacy; >= 4 on the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine-Short Form (REALM-R) literacy scale\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 45 Years\nMust have maximum age of 80 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Receiving any other smoking cessation interventions currently or within the prior 30 days\n* Contraindication to nicotine replacement therapy\n* Pneumonia or serious lung infection in prior 12 weeks\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active major infection, malignant tumors (unless these tumors were: (a) completely resected basal cell or squamous cell skin carcinomas or (b) in-situ squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix or anus), or any other major uncontrolled comorbid condition that would limit life expectancy or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements\n* History of lung cancer\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because computed tomography introduces radiation exposure and may have teratogenic effects\n* Women who are breastfeeding (the safety of nicotine replacement therapy has not been established with breastfeeding)\n* Received a chest computed tomography scan in the previous twelve months",
