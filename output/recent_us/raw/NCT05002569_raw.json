Acceptable forms of birth control for female patients include: hormonal birth control, intrauterine device, diaphragm with spermicide, condom with spermicide, or abstinence, for the length of the study. If the participant is a female and becomes pregnant or suspects pregnancy, she must immediately notify her doctor. If the participant becomes pregnant during this study, she will be taken off this study.\n\n    a. Approved methods of birth control are as follows: Hormonal contraception (i.e. birth control pills, injection, implant, transdermal patch, vaginal ring), Intrauterine device (IUD), Tubal Ligation or hysterectomy, Subject/Partner post vasectomy, Implantable or injectable contraceptives, and condoms plus spermicide. Not engaging in sexual activity for the total duration of the trial and the drug washout period is an acceptable practice; however periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of birth control. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physicaian immediately.\n13. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception, such as subject post vasectomy, partner with implantable or oninjectable contraceptives, and condoms plus spermicide, prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 4 months after completion of study agent administration. Men who are able to have children must use effective birth control while on the study. If the male participant fathers a child or suspects that he has fathered a child while on the study, he must immediately notify his doctor.\n14. Signed consent to long-term follow-up protocol PA17-0483 to fulfill the institutional responsibilities to various regulatory agencies.\n15. Life Expectancy >=3 mo, by PI assessment\n16. Patients are HLA-A*02:01 positive on HLA typing.\n17. Patients must have one of the following diseases:\n\nAcute myeloid leukemia (AML): one of the following:\n\n1. Patients with active (>5% of blasts or positive MRD at a level of >0.1% measured by multiparameter flow cytometry) relapsed or refractory AML. Who have received at least two lines of therapy. One or more of the lines of therapy must include hypomethylating agents and venetoclax. Patients who have mutations for which there are FDA approved targeted therapies (i.e. FLT3) must also have received at least one of such agent. Patients with diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia are not eligible. Patients who relapse after allogeneic stem cell transplantation are eligible irrespective of the number and type of therapy received prior transplant.\n\n1. Relapsed AML is defined as patients who had a first complete remission (CR) before developing recurrent disease.\n2. Refractory AML is defined as patients that have not achieved a CR after 2 cycles of standard induction chemotherapy.\n\nOR determining the eligibility of the patient. For example, patients who received hypomethylating agents and venetoclax for the treatment of the MDS are not required to receive again hypomethylating agents and venetoclax to treat the secondary AML to be eligible. Similarly, patients who received two lines of therapy for the management of the MDS or MPD are not required to receive an additional two lines of therapy for the management of the AML to be eligible. Patients who relapse after allogeneic stem cell transplantation are eligible irrespective of the number and type of therapy received prior transplant.\n\nMyelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)/Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML):one of the following:\n\n1. Patients with high risk or intermediate risk MDS/CMML who have received at least two lines of therapy and have positive MRD at a level of >0.1% measured by multiparameter flow cytometry or are not in morphological remission.\n\n   OR\n2. Patients with relapse high risk or intermediate risk MDS/CMML after at least 2 lines of therapy. Relapse is defined as positive MRD at a level of >0.1% measured by multiparameter flow cytometry or loss of morphological remission.\n\n   OR\n3. CMML patients with refractory disease defined as failure to achieve complete remission after 4 therapy cycles of hypomethylating agent therapy or relapse or progression after any number of cycles of therapy.\n4. Patients with MDS/CMML who relapse after allogeneic stem cell transplantation are eligible irrespective of the number and type of therapy received prior to transplant.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 80 Years",
