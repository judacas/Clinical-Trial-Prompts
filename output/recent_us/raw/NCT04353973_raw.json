    "inclusion_criteria": "* INCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\nSubjects must have prostate cancer amenable for ultrasound ablation defined as:\n\n* diagnosed by transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy via standard 12 core biopsy and targeted biopsy of any MRI-visible or tracked lesions; pathological diagnosis must be confirmed by Laboratory of Pathology, NCI;\n* Gleason Score <= 7;\n* MRI-visible or MRI-tracked prostate cancer. This includes prostate cancer found on targeted biopsy of MRI-visible or MRI-tracked lesion. Histologically positive standard biopsy cores of Grade Group >= 2 prostate cancer must be from an area overlying or within 1cm of an MRI-visible or tracked lesion(s) and reviewed by NCI urologic pathologist. (Left / Right, Base, Mid-Gland, Apex). Systematic and targeted cores of Grade Group 1 prostate cancer outside of proposed ablation zone do not affect inclusion status, as these can be observed by conventional guideline management.\n* organ confined clinical T1c or clinical T2a prostate cancer that is visualized on MRI. Note: Participants after prostate cancer treatment with local recurrence or residual tumor which is visible on MRI are eligible.\n* PSA < 20 ng/ml or PSA >20 with a PSA density <0.15.\n* Adults (>= 18 years of age)\n* Participants must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:\n\nPlatelets >= 50,000/mcL\n\nHemoglobin >= 8 g/dL\n\nMeasured or calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl) (eGFR may also be used in place of CrCl)* >= 30 mL/min/1.73 m^2\n\nGFR=glomerular filtration rate; ULN=upper limit of normal.\n\n*Creatinine clearance (CrCl) or eGFR should be calculated per institutional standard.\n\n* Subjects must be able to understand and willing to sign a written informed consent document.\n* Subjects must be co-enrolled to NCI protocol 16-C-0010 \"Care of the Prostate Cancer Patient and Prospective Procurement of Prostate Cancer Tissue.\"\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\n* Targeted lesion ablation length from apex to base of >5 cm or lesion extending >3 cm from the urethra.\n* Target ablation volume greater than 100 ml.\n* Presence of calcifications that would impede ultrasound transmission between the urethra and ablative target.\n* Participants are unable to tolerate MRI (foreign body, i.e., pacemaker or other implanted device; claustrophobia; inability to tolerate rectal coil; etc.)\n* Acute urinary tract infection\n* Lower urinary tract symptoms defined by an IPSS > 20\n* Participants with uncontrolled coagulopathies (including liver dysfunction, or untreated hereditary coagulopathies which have a standard of care treatment) per surgeon discretion based on bleeding risk.\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situation (within time frame) that would limit compliance with study requirements.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be MALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
