    "official_title": "A Prospective International Multicenter Phase II Study to Evaluate the Efficacy, Safety and Quality of Life of Pazopanib in Patients With Advanced and/or Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma After Previous Therapy With Checkpoint Inhibitor Treatment",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Histologically confirmed locally recurrent or metastatic predominantly clear cell renal cell carcinoma.\n* Measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1 criteria\n* Prior systemic therapy with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (monotherapy or combination) as 1st or 2nd line RCC treatment. Note: patients with prior mTOR inhibitor or TKI treatment as monotherapy or in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitor were allowed; however, treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitor (monotherapy or in combination) must have been the last treatment prior to study entry.\n* Last dose of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy received 4 or more weeks before start of study treatment\n* Karnofsky performance status ≥70%.\n* Potassium, sodium, calcium and magnesium within normal limits of the central laboratory\n\nKey\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Renal cell carcinoma without any clear (conventional) cell component\n* History or evidence of central nervous system (CNS) metastases (patients with pretreated metastases were eligible under certain conditions)\n* Prior treatment with pazopanib\n* Prior treatment with bevacizumab that was not given in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.\n* Prior treatment with more than 2 lines of therapy (combination treatments were considered 1 line of therapy)\n* Not recovered from toxicity from prior immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Recovery was defined as ≤ NCI-CTCAE Grade 1, except for liver function test levels which must be <Grade 1.\n* Disease recurrence less than 6 months from the last dose of prior neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy (including VEGF-R TKI)\n* Patients receiving prohibited concomitant medications that could not be discontinued or replaced by safe alternative medication at least 5 half-lives of the concomitant medication or 7 days, whichever was longer, prior to the start of pazopanib treatment.\n* Administration of any investigational drug within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment",
