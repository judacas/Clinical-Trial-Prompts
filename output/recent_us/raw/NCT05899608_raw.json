Participants who are participating in the follow-up period of an interventional clinical trial are eligible for the study.\n* Any systemic anti-cancer treatment within 2 weeks or 5 half-lives (whichever is shorter) prior to start of study treatment\n* Treatment with investigational therapy within 28 days prior to initiation of study treatment\n* Pregnant or breastfeeding, or intending to become pregnant during the study\n* History of or concurrent serious medical condition or abnormality in clinical laboratory tests that, in the investigator's judgment, precludes the patient's safe participation in and completion of the study or confounds the ability to interpret data from the study\n* Severe infection within 4 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment or any active infection that, in the opinion of the investigator, could impact patient safety\n* Incomplete recovery from any surgery prior to the start of study treatment that would interfere with the determination of safety or efficacy of study treatment\n* Uncontrolled pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, or ascites requiring recurrent drainage procedures (once monthly or more frequently)\n* Uncontrolled tumor-related pain\n* Uncontrolled or symptomatic hypercalcemia\n* Clinically significant and active liver disease\n* Negative HIV test at screening, with the following exception: Participants with a positive HIV test at screening are eligible provided they are stable on anti-retroviral therapy for at least 4 weeks, have a CD4 count greater than or equal to 200/uL, have an undetectable viral load, and have not had a history of opportunistic infection attributable to AIDS within the last 12 months.\n* Symptomatic, untreated, or actively progressing CNS metastases\n* History of leptomeningeal disease or carcinomatous meningitis\n* History of malignancy other than CRC within 2 years prior to screening, with the exception of malignancies with a negligible risk of metastasis or death\n* Any other disease, unresolved toxicity from prior therapy, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding that contraindicates the use of an investigational drug, may affect the interpretation of the results, or may render the participant at high risk from treatment complications\n* Requirement for treatment with any medicinal product that contraindicates the use of any of the study treatments, may interfere with the planned treatment, affects participant compliance, or puts the patient at higher risk for treatment-related complications\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
