Age ≥ 18 years at the time of consent.\n3. Karnofsky score of >60%\n4. Histological or cytological evidence/confirmation of CD30+ peripheral T-cell lymphoma per the 2017 World Health Organization Classification of Haematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissues.\n5. CD30+ disease determined by biopsy after the subject's most recent anti-CD30 therapy prior to ATLCAR.CD30 (result can be pending at the time of cell procurement but must be confirmed prior to treatment with the first infusion of ATLCAR.CD30 cells). NOTE: CD30+ disease requires documented CD30 expression by immunohistochemistry based on the institutional hematopathology standard.\n6. Any subjects who has received at least two prior lines of therapy for their lymphoma. If transplant is given as a preplanned consolidation in first remission, it will not be counted as a second line of therapy.\n7. Any subject who has received one line of therapy who has primary refractory lymphoma or lymphoma that relapsed within 12 months of completing chemotherapy or receiving transplant as long as prior therapy included brentuximab vedotin unless they were not candidates for brentuximab vedotin.\n8. Subjects relapsed after autologous stem cell transplant are eligible for this study.\n9. Subjects relapsed after allogeneic stem cell transplantation are eligible provided the patient is ≥180 days from transplant, not on immunosuppresive therapy to treat/prevent graft-versus-host disease and has no evidence of active graft-versus-host disease.\n10. Subjects with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen are eligible for this trial.\n11. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to cell procurement. Note: Females are considered of childbearing potential unless they are surgically sterile (have undergone a hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or they are naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months. Documentation of postmenopausal status must be provided.\n12. Female subjects of childbearing potential must be willing to abstain from heterosexual activity or to use 2 forms of effective methods of contraception from the time of informed consent until 6 months after study treatment discontinuation. The two contraception methods can be comprised of two barrier methods, or a barrier method plus a hormonal method or an intrauterine device that meets <1% failure rate for protection from pregnancy in the product label. Women of childbearing potential will also be instructed to tell their male partners to use a condom.\n13. Subject is willing and able to comply with study procedures based on the judgement of the investigator or protocol designee.\n\nExclusion Criteria for the Study\n\n1. Subject is pregnant or lactating (Note: Breast milk cannot be stored for future use while the mother is being treated on study ).\n2. Current use of systemic corticosteroids at doses ≥10 mg prednisone daily or its equivalent; those receiving <10 mg daily may be enrolled at discretion of investigator. Inhaled steroids are allowed.\n3.

Subjects who are positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (can be pending at the time of cell procurement; only those samples confirming lack of active infection will be used to generate transduced cells) are excluded. Subjects who are hepatitis B surface antigen negative but hepatitis B core antibody positive must have their hepatitis B viral load checked. These subjects will be excluded if their viral load is positive at baseline.
