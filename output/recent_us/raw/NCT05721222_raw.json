Histologically or cytologically confirmed solid malignancy.\n2. Male or non-pregnant, non-lactating female patients age ≥18 years.\n3. Locally advanced or metastatic disease that is refractory to standard therapy [note for patients with NSCLC patients with activating ALK translocation or EGFR mutations must have been treated and failed appropriate therapy], or for which there is no standard available therapy.\n4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status ≤ 2.\n5. Subject with a life expectancy of ≥ 12 weeks.\n6. Adequate hematologic function as indicated by\n\n   1. Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3\n   2. Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0g/dL\n   3. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1000/uL Note: Use of growth-factors to maintain ANC criterion (within 28 days prior to the first dose of study drug and within 28 days after day 1 of Cycle 1) is not permitted.\n7. Adequate renal and liver function as indicated by:\n\n   1. Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN); if serum creatinine is >1.5 x ULN, creatinine clearance must be ≥ 50 mL/min either by calculation or by measured 24-hour urine collection\n   2. Total bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN; If Gilbert's Syndrome may have Bilirubin> 1.5 x ULN\n   3. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤3 x ULN of institution's normal range; for patients with known liver metastases, AST and ALT may be ≤ 5 x ULN.\n   4. Coagulation: aPTT and PT≤ 1.3 x ULN\n8. Patients with brain metastases are eligible if clinically controlled that is defined as surgical excision and/or radiation therapy followed by 21 days of stable neurologic function & no evidence of CNS disease progression as determined by CT or MRI within 21 days prior to the first dose of study drug.\n9. Willingness to use contraception by a method that is deemed effective by the investigator by both males and female patients of child bearing potential (postmenopausal women must have been amenorrheal for at least 12 months to be considered of non-childbearing potential) and their partners throughout the treatment period and for at least three months following the last dose of study drug.\n10. Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent form (the consent form must be signed by the patient prior to any study-specific procedures).\n11. Willingness and ability to comply with study procedures and follow-up examination.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "To be eligible for entry into the study, the subject must not meet any of the exclusion criteria listed below:\n\n1. Receiving concurrent anti-cancer therapy or investigational therapy (chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery, immunotherapy, hormonal therapy, targeted therapy, biologic therapy, (with the exception of hormones for hypothyroidism, estrogen replacement therapy, or LHRH agonists required to suppress serum testosterone levels).\n2. Patients who have experienced a Grade 3 or higher toxicity related to prior PD-1/PD-L1 treatment.\n3. Prior anticancer therapy less than 21 days of study entry, or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter.\n4. Steroid therapy for anti-neoplastic intent within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug.\n5. Continuance of toxicities due to prior radiotherapy or chemotherapy agents that do not recover to ≤ Grade 1.\n6. Known bleeding diathesis/disorder unless controlled.\n7. Recent history of non-chemotherapy induced thrombocytopenia associated bleeding within 1 year prior to first dose of study drug.\n8. Have active immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), active autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AHA), or a history of being refractory to platelet transfusions (within 1 year prior to the first dose of study drug).\n9. Serious gastrointestinal bleeding within 3 months.\n10. Received a biologic (G-CSF, GM-CSF or erythropoietin) within 28 days prior to the first dose of study drug and within 28 days after the first dose.\n11. Patients with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (>10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days before the planned first dose of study drug. Inhaled or topical steroids, and adrenal replacement steroid doses > 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease. Ophthalmologic, nasal and intra-articular injections or steroids are acceptable.\n12. Failure to recover adequately, as judged by the investigator, from prior surgical procedures. Patients who have had major surgery within 28 days from study entry, and patients who have had minor surgery within 14 days of study entry.\n13. Unstable angina, myocardial infarction, or a coronary revascularization procedure within 180 days of study entry.\n14. Neurologic instability per clinical evaluation due to tumor involvement of the central nervous system (CNS). Patients with CNS tumors that have been treated, are asymptomatic and who have discontinued steroids (for the treatment of CNS tumors) for>28 days may be enrolled.\n15. Positive laboratory test for HBsAg or anti-HCV. Patients with anti-hepatitis B core antibody are eligible if negative for HBsAg; patients positive for anti-HCV may be enrolled if negative by nucleic acid amplification test.\n16. Has a history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody positive, or tests positive for HIV at screening.\n17. Any diagnosis of autoimmune disease. Subjects with hypothyroidism stable on hormone replacement, adrenal insufficiency on steroid replacement, skin disorders (such as vitiligo, psoriasis or alopecia) not requiring systemic treatment are permitted to enroll.\n18. Grade 3 or higher pneumonitis or neuropathy during previous treatment with immunotherapy.\n19. Diagnosis of fever and neutropenia within 1 week prior to study drug administration.\n20. Uncontrolled concurrent illness including, but not limited to: serious uncontrolled diabetes (blood glucose > 250 mg/dL), symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with the study requirements.\n21. Patient has received a live, attenuated vaccine within 28 days of planned start of study therapy.\n22. Known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to protein-based therapies or with a history of any significant drug allergy (e.g., anaphylaxis, hepatotoxicity, immune-mediated thrombocytopenia or anemia), or to LZM009 recipients (refer to Investigator's Brochure).\n23. Currently participating and receiving study therapy or has participated in a study of an investigational agent and received study therapy or used an investigational device within 21 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter, before the start of study treatment, the exception of participants in the follow-up phase.\n24. Any other condition or circumstance of that would, in the opinion of the investigator, make the patient unsuitable for participation in the study.",
