    "official_title": "Test-Retest of (18)F-Fluoroazomycin Arabinoside ([18F]FAZA) PET-CT of Solid Tumors",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Patients with histopathologic diagnosis of a solid tumor. All solid tumors will be considered, but patients with breast, pancreas, and colorectal masses will be prioritized.\n* Patient must have a solid tumor with a short-axis greater than or equal to 1 cm (by CT, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], ultrasonography or mammography) to allow reliable PET imaging.\n* A patient who has not received systemic or loco-regional treatment of the tumor within the last month.\n* Ability of the subject, or the legally authorized representative (LAR) if the patient is deemed by the treating physician to be cognitively impaired or questionably impaired in such a way that the ability of the patient to give informed consent is questionable, to understand, and the willingness to sign, a written informed consent.\n* Patients who are not expected to receive cancer therapy before imaging sessions are completed.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Pregnant or lactating women: pregnant women are excluded from this study because the effects of [18F] FAZA in pregnancy are not known. A urine or serum pregnancy test will be performed before accrual after informed consent is obtained.\n* Lactation should be suspended for at least two days following the administration of [18F] FAZA to the mother, because of the unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to administration of the radionuclide to a lactating woman.\n* Subjects with contraindications to the use of [18F] FAZA including confirmed allergy.\n* Patients with a body weight of 400 pounds or more, or a body mass index (BMI) which precludes their entry into the bore of the PET/CT scanner, because the findings will probably be compromised in image quality with CT, PET/CT and MRI.\n* Any additional medical condition, serious concurrent illness, or other extenuating circumstance that, in the opinion of the investigator may significantly interfere with study compliance.",
