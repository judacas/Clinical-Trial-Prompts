A female participant is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant or breastfeeding, and at least one of the following conditions applies:\n\n  * Is not a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) OR\n  * Is a WOCBP and using a contraceptive method that is highly effective (with a failure rate of < 1% per year), preferably with low user dependency, during the intervention period and for at least 4 months after the last dose of study intervention and agrees not to donate eggs (ova, oocytes) for the purpose of reproduction during this period. The investigator should evaluate the effectiveness of the contraceptive method in relationship to the first dose of study intervention.\n\nWOCBP refers to sexually mature female, regardless of sexual orientation or whether they have undergone tubal ligation, who: 1) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 2) has not been naturally menopausal for at least 24 consecutive months. A WOCBP must have a negative highly sensitive serum pregnancy test (as required by local regulations) within 72 hours before the first dose of study intervention. The investigator is responsible for review of medical history, menstrual history, and recent sexual activity to decrease the risk for inclusion of a woman with a nearly undetected pregnancy.\n\nNonchildbearing potential is defined as follows (by other than medical reasons):\n\n* >= 45 years of age and has not had menses for > 1 year\n* Patients who have been amenorrhoeic for < 2 years without history of a hysterectomy and oophorectomy must have a follicle stimulating hormone value in the postmenopausal range upon screening evaluation\n* Post-hysterectomy, post-bilateral oophorectomy, or post-tubal ligation. Documented hysterectomy or oophorectomy must be confirmed with medical records of the actual procedure or confirmed by an ultrasound. Tubal ligation must be confirmed with medical records of the actual procedure\n\n  * Male participants: contraceptive use should be consistent with local regulations regarding the methods of contraception for those participating in clinical studies. Male participants are eligible to participate if they agree to the following during the intervention period and for 6 months after the last dose of study treatment to allow for clearance of any altered sperm:\n* Refrain from donating sperm PLUS either:\n* Be abstinent from heterosexual intercourse as their preferred and usual lifestyle (abstinent on a long term and persistent basis) and agree to remain abstinent OR\n* Must agree to use contraception/barrier as detailed below:\n\n  * Agree to use a male condom, even if they have undergone a successful vasectomy, and female partner to use an additional highly effective contraceptive method with a failure rate of < 1% per year as when having sexual intercourse with a woman of childbearing potential (including pregnant females)\n\n    * All prior treatment-related toxicities (defined by National Cancer Institute- Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events [NCI-CTCAE], version 4.03) must be =< grade 1 at the time of enrolment except for alopecia\n    * Participant must be able to understand the study procedures and agree to participate in the study by providing written informed consent\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
