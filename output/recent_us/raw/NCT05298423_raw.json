    "official_title": "A Phase 1B/2 Multicohort Umbrella Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Novel Treatments And/Or Combinations of Treatments in Participants With Ovarian Cancer (OPAL)",
    "inclusion_criteria": "- Participant must be female greater than or equal to (>=)18 years of age, able to understand the study procedures, and agree to participate in the study by providing written informed consent.\n\n* Participants must have the following histologic diagnosis unless otherwise specified in a cohort-specific supplement:\n\n  1. Phase 2 cohorts: Participant has histologically diagnosed high-grade recurrent epithelial (that is [i.e.], serous, endometrioid, mucinous, clear cell) ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer or carcinosarcoma of the ovary. Participant with high-grade mixed histology is also eligible.\n  2. For the Phase 1B components: Participant has histologically diagnosed gynecologic malignancy (i.e., any cancer that started in a woman's reproductive system). Gynecologic malignancies include cervical cancer; endometrial cancer; vaginal cancer; vulvar cancer; high-grade recurrent epithelial (i.e., serous, endometrioid, mucinous, clear cell) ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer; or advanced carcinosarcoma of the ovary. Participant with high-grade mixed histology is also eligible.\n* The allowed number of prior lines of anticancer therapy for primary cancer will be specified in each cohort-specific supplement. Treatment with hormonal agents alone are not counted in the number of lines of therapy. Treatment with single-agent bevacizumab or PARP inhibitors given as maintenance is not counted as a separate line of therapy. If a therapeutic regimen is modified or changed for a reason other than lack of response or PD (such as allergic reaction, toxicity, or drug availability), this is not counted as a separate line of therapy.\n* Phase 2 cohorts: Participant must have measurable disease according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v) 1.1.\n* Participant has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 2.\n* Participant has adequate organ function, defined as follows:\n\n  1. Absolute neutrophil count >=1500 per microliter (/mcL), without growth factor support (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor administration is not permitted within 2 weeks prior to screening).\n  2. Platelets >=100,000/mcL without platelet transfusion support within 2 weeks prior to screening.\n  3. Hemoglobin >=9 grams/deciliter (g/dL) without transfusion or growth factor (recombinant erythropoietin) within 2 weeks of screening.\n  4. Serum creatinine less than or equal to (<=)1.5 times (*) upper limit of normal (ULN) or calculated creatinine clearance >=50 milliliter per minute (mL/min) using Cockcroft-Gault equation.\n  5. Total bilirubin <=1.5* ULN, except in participants with Gilbert's syndrome. Participants with Gilbert's syndrome may enroll if direct bilirubin is <=1.5* ULN.\n  6. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) <=2.5* ULN, unless liver metastases are present, in which case they must be <=5* ULN.\n  7. International normalized ratio or prothrombin time (PT) <=1.5* ULN unless participant is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or partial thromboplastin time (PTT) is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants.\n  8. Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) <=1.5* ULN unless participant is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants. Participant with known lupus anticoagulant and elevated PTT may be eligible on a case-by-case basis after discussion with the Sponsor's Medical Monitor.\n* Participant is not pregnant or breastfeeding, and at least 1 of the following conditions apply:\n\n  1. Is not a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP), or\n  2. Is a WOCBP using a contraceptive method that is highly effective (with a failure rate of less than [<]1 percent [%] per year), with low user dependency, during the treatment period and for at least 180 days after the last dose of study treatment and agrees not to donate eggs (ova, oocytes) for the purpose of reproduction during this period. The investigator should evaluate the effectiveness of the contraceptive method in relation to the first dose of study treatment.\n\n     * A WOCBP must have a negative pregnancy test (highly sensitive urine test or serum test as required by local regulations) within 72 hours before the first dose of study treatment. If a urine test cannot be confirmed as negative (for example [e.g.], an ambiguous result), a serum pregnancy test is required. In such cases, the participant must be excluded from participation if the serum pregnancy result is positive.\n     * Additional requirements for pregnancy testing during and after study treatment as per protocol.\n* Participant must provide sufficient tumor tissue samples based on requirements defined in each cohort-specific supplement.\n\nInclusion criteria specific to Cohort A:\n\n* Participants must be resistant to the most recent platinum-based therapy, defined for the purpose of this protocol as progression within 6 months from completion of a minimum of 4 cycles of platinum-containing therapy. This should be calculated from the date of the last administered dose of platinum therapy to the date of the radiographic imaging showing disease progression. Participants with primary platinum-refractory disease as defined by those who progressed during or within 4 weeks of completion of first platinum-based chemotherapy are not eligible.\n* Participant must not have received any prior therapy for ovarian cancer with a PARP inhibitor\n* Participant has had 1 to 2 prior lines of anticancer therapy for ovarian cancer\n* Participant is able to take oral medications.\n\nInclusion criteria specific to Cohort C:\n\n* Participant has newly diagnosed Stage III or IV ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer according to the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics staging criteria.\n* Participant must provide sufficient tumor tissue at Prescreening and agree to undergo a central HRD tumor testing using a fully validated assay. The tumor must be HRd as per central HRD tumor testing. If central testing does not confirm tumor HRd, the participant will not be eligible for the study.\n\n  1. Participants with documented germline breast cancer gene (BRCA)1/2 deleterious or suspected deleterious mutations by approved test (e.g., BRAC Analysis companion diagnostic [CDx]) will be eligible but will require central HRD testing. Participants with local, academic, or university-based germline BRCA1/2 testing will not be allowed to enroll without results of central HRD test.\n  2. All participants must agree to provide tumor tissue collected from IDS.\n  3. Participant must provide 2 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks (or slides if blocks are not available) with sufficient tumor content (as confirmed by the sponsor's designated central and/or testing laboratory) for central HRD testing at Prescreening and for exploratory biomarker testing at Prescreening or Screening. If sufficient tumor tissue is provided at Prescreening, participants do not need to provide additional tissue at Screening.\n* Participant must have completed 1 run-in cycle of carboplatin-paclitaxel and not experienced disease progression after this treatment. Completion is defined as receiving >=50% of the prescribed dose of therapy within 5 weeks.\n* Participant must not have known contraindication or uncontrolled hypersensitivity to carboplatin and paclitaxel and their excipients and no known pre-existing conditions that would preclude treatment with these agents.\n* Participant must not have known contraindication or uncontrolled hypersensitivity to niraparib and its excipients.\n* Participant must not have symptomatic ascites or pleural effusions as defined by the following criterion: presence of fluid in the abdominal or pleural cavities requiring removal within 1 week prior to signing the informed consent.\n* Participant must agree to complete patient-reported outcomes (PRO) and work productivity questionnaires throughout the study.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be FEMALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
