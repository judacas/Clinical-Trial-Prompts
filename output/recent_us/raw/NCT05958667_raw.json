Note: Intention to transplant and type of high dose chemotherapy (HDCT) regimen will be documented at the time of study entry\n* Disease that is both active on PET scan (defined as 5-Deauville scorepoint-scale of 4 or 5) and measurable on CT scan, defined as::\n\n  * Nodal lesions >15 mm in the long axis, regardless of the length of the short axis, and/or\n  * Extranodal lesions (outside lymph node or nodal mass, but including liver and spleen) >10 mm in long AND short axis\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1\n* Adequate organ function:\n\nRenal function defined as:\n\n* Serum creatinine of ≤1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN), OR estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2\n\nHepatic function defined as:\n\n* Alanine Transaminase (ALT) and Aspartate Transiminase (AST) ≤ 5 × ULN\n* Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN with the exception of patients with Gilbert syndrome who may be included if their total bilirubin is ≤3.0 × ULN and direct bilirubin ≤1.5 × ULN\n\nHematologic Function (regardless of transfusions) defined as:\n\n* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >1000/mm3\n* Absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) >300/mm3 OR Absolute number of CD3+ T cells >150/mm3 (only for patients with non-historical apheresis)\n* Platelets ≥50000/mm3\n* Hemoglobin >8.0 g/dl\n\nAdequate pulmonary function defined as:\n\n* No or mild dyspnea (≤ Grade 1)\n* Oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry > 90% on room air\n* Forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) ≥ 50% and/or carbon monoxide diffusion test (DLCO) ≥50% of predicted level - Must have a leukapheresis material of non-mobilized cells available for manufacturing.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 100 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Prior treatment with anti-CD19 therapy, T cell therapy, or any prior gene therapy product\n* Treatment with any systemic lymphoma-directed second line anticancer therapy prior to randomization. Only steroids and local irradiation are permitted for disease control\n* Patients with active central nervous system (CNS) involvement by disease under study are excluded, except if the CNS involvement has been effectively treated and local treatment was >4 weeks before randomization\n* Prior allogeneic HSCT\n* Clinically significant active infection\n* Any of the following cardiovascular conditions:\n\n  * Unstable angina, myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), or stroke within 6 months prior to screening,\n  * Left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) <45% as determined by echocardiogram (ECHO) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or multigated acquisition (MUGA) at the screening assessment.\n  * New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III or IV (Chavey et al 2001), within the past 12 months.\n  * Clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias (e.g., ventricular tachycardia), complete left bundle branch block, high-grade atrioventricular (AV) block (e.g., bifascicular block, Mobitz type II) and third degree AV block unless adequately controlled by pacemaker implantation.\n  * Resting QTcF ≥450 msec (male) or ≥460 msec (female) at screening or inability to determine the QTcF interval\n  * Risk factors for Torsades de Pointes (TdP), including uncorrected hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, history of cardiac failure, or history of clinically significant/ symptomatic bradycardia, or any of the following:\n  * Long QT syndrome, family history of idiopathic sudden death or congenital long QT syndrome\n  * Concomitant medication(s) with a \"Known Risk of Torsades de Pointes\" per crediblemeds.org that cannot be discontinued or replaced by safe alternative medication.\n* Patients with active neurological autoimmune or inflammatory disorders (e.g., Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)) and clinically significant active cerebrovascular disorders (e.g. cerebral edema, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES))",
