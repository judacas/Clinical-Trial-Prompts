Paroxysmal AF or persistent AF, in whom catheter ablation (CA) for AF is expected within 1 year (A group) or in whom catheter ablation is NOT expected within 1 year (M group)\n4. Ability to provide informed consent before any trial-related activities.\n5. Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) will be included:\n\n   1. If HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin) is less than or equal to 10 %\n   2. If the subject is taking basal insulin only or oral hypoglycemic agents or a combination of those.\n   3. Patients on SGLT2-inhibitors and TZDs (Thiazolidinedione) will be included if they have been on a stable dose of these medications for at least 6 months\n   4. The following protocol will be adopted to adjust insulin secretagogues (sulfonylureas or meglitinides) and insulin during the study (adapted from the Look Ahead Study).\n\nPatients will be asked to check their blood glucose (BG) 4 x day (before meals and at bed time) during the dose escalation and dose stabilization phases (weeks 0 to 20) and recommendation of dose adjustments will be immediately sent to their treating physician according to the dose adjustment scale below:\n\n* 2 blood sugars <100 mg/dl- reduce meds [insulin secretagogues (sulfonylureas or meglitinides) and basal insulin] by 0-50 %\n* 3 blood sugars 80-100 mg/dl- reduce meds [insulin secretagogues (sulfonylureas or meglitinides) and basal insulin] by 25-75%\n* 3 blood sugars <80 mg/dl > 2 x week or severe hypoglycemia or symptomatic hypoglycemia- reduce meds [insulin secretagogues (sulfonylureas or meglitinides) and basal insulin] by 50-100 %\n\nRandomization to treatment (active and placebo) will be stratified to balance patients with T2DM across the study arms. After completion of the trial a prespecified subgroup analysis of the patients enrolled affected by T2DM will be performed.\n\nFor women of child-bearing potential, use of appropriate contraception will be required.\n\nIn patients that are prescribed amiodarone, standard care practices will be implemented to evaluate for liver and thyroid side effects with baseline liver and thyroid function tests via blood draw and evaluation every 6 months.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 75 Years",
