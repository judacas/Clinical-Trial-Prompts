    "inclusion_criteria": "* INCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\nTo be eligible for entry into the study, a candidate must meet all the following criteria:\n\n1. Be 18 years of age or older.\n2. Have recurrent glioblastoma that is amenable to surgical resection.\n3. Agree to undergo brain surgery.\n4.

Have a bleeding disorder that cannot be corrected before invasive testing or surgery, or other medical conditions that would make surgery unsafe, such as lung or cardiac disease that would render them unable to tolerate the risk of general anesthesia, or severe immunodeficiency.\n2. Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment within 3 years of registration. Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or in situ cervical cancer that has undergone potentially curative therapy.\n3. Are pregnant or breastfeeding\n4. Cannot have an MRI scan.\n5. Are claustrophobic\n6. Are not able to lie on their back for up to 60 minutes\n7. Have primary CNS lymphoma.\n8. Has received systemic immunosuppressive treatments, aside from systemic corticosteroids (such as methotrexate, chloroquine, azathioprine, etc) within six months of registration\n9. Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment\n10. Have a significant cardiac history, such as 2 or more MIs OR 2 or more coronary revascularization procedures.\n11. Have abnormal findings on ECG such as prolonged QT interval, T-wave abnormalities or arrhythmia. Abnormal findings on ECG will prompt an evaluation by a cardiologist prior to enrollment in the study\n12. Are currently undergoing treatment with another therapeutic agent for glioblastoma\n13. Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CD137, or anti- Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) antibody (including ipilimumab or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation or checkpoint pathways).\n14. Have an ejection fraction less than 50% on screening echocardiogram\n15. Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies) at the time of enrollment\n16. Has known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA [qualitative] is detected) at the time of enrollment.\n17. Have an active infection that requires systemic antibacterial, antiviral or antifungal therapy Less than 7 days prior to initiation of study drug therapy\n18. Have a history of transfer of autologous or allogeneic T cells\n19. Have a history of solid organ or tissue transplants\n20. Have cardiac Troponin T or I greater than 2 times the institutional upper limit of normal at screening\n21. At the time of enrollment, lack of consent capacity due to cognitive impairment that would make them incapable of understanding the explanation of the procedures in this study. Cognitive capacity to consent will be determined at the time of enrollment. Patients with mental disorders or those patients who are cognitively impaired yet still retain consent capacity will not be excluded.\n22. Cannot speak English or Spanish fluently\n23. Patients that require dexamethasone greater than 4 mg/ day or equivalent of steroids\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
