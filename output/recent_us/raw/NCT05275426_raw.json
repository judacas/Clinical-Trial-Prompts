    "miscellaneous_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria Part 1 and Part 2:\n\n* Adult with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic (not amenable to curative therapy) histologically documented gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1\n* Measurable disease or non-measurable, but evaluable disease, according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1)\n* Participant has no contraindications to nivolumab and either mFOLFOX6 or CAPOX chemotherapy as per local prescribing information. Participants in Part 1 must have no contraindications to mFOLFOX6. Participants in Part 2 with contraindications to mFOLFOX6 are permitted and may be administered the CAPOX regimen, if no contraindications for this regimen exist. Participants in Part 2 with contraindications to CAPOX are permitted and may be administered the mFOLFOX6 regimen, if no contraindications for this regimen exist\n* Adequate organ function as follows:\n\n  * Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 x 10^9/L\n  * Platelet count ≥ 100 x 10^9/L\n  * Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL without red blood cell (RBC) transfusion within 7 days prior to the first dose of study treatment\n  * Aspartate aminotransaminase (AST) and Alanine aminotransaminase (ALT) <3 x upper limit of normal (ULN) (or < 5 x ULN if liver involvement)\n  * Total bilirubin <1.5 x ULN (or < 2 x ULN if liver involvement or Gilbert's disease)\n  * Part 1 only: Calculated or measured creatinine clearance (CrCl) of ≥ 50 mL/minute calculated using the formula of Cockcroft and Gault ([140 - Age] × Mass [kg]/[72 × Creatinine mg/dL]) (x 0.85 if female).\n* Part 2 only: Calculated or measured creatinine clearance (CrCl) of ≥ 30 mL/minute calculated using the formula of Cockcroft and Gault ([140 - Age] × Mass [kg]/[72 × Creatinine mg/dL]) (x 0.85 if female).\n* INR or prothrombin time (PT) < 1.5 × ULN except for participants receiving anticoagulation, who must be on a stable dose of anticoagulant therapy for 6 weeks prior to enrollment\n\nAdditional Inclusion Criteria Part 2:\n\n* No prior treatment for metastatic or unresectable disease except for a maximum of\n\n  1 dose of chemotherapy with or without nivolumab; prior adjuvant, neo-adjuvant, and peri-operative therapy is allowed, provided it has been completed more than 6 months prior to the first dose of study treatment\n* Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2b (FGFR2b) ≥ 10% 2+/3+ tumor cells (TC) as determined by centrally performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) testing, based on tumor sample either archival (obtained within 6 months/180 days prior to signing pre-screening informed consent) or a fresh biopsy."
