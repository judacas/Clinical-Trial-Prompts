    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Patient must have advanced (FIGO 2014 Stage III or IV), persistent, or recurrent endometrial carcinoma, which is not likely to be curable by surgery or radiotherapy. Histologic confirmation of recurrent disease is required. For cases of persistent disease, histologic confirmation of the primary disease with radiologic evidence of progression is required.\n2. Patients must have endometrioid histology (all grades allowed) based on hysterectomy or biopsy specimen and have positive expression of ER and oncogenic PIK3CA mutation per criteria below.\n\n   a. PIK3CA mutations considered oncogenic or likely oncogenic. i. Oncogenic/likely oncogenic PIK3CA mutations identified on tests performed by the labs listed on https://ecog-acrin.org/nci-match-eay131-designated-labs will be considered confirmed for the purposes of this study.\n\n   ii. Oncogenic/likely oncogenic PIK3CA mutations identified by other tests will need to be confirmed by the study prior to enrollment.\n\n   b. Estrogen receptor (ER) status will be considered positive if ≥1% of tumor cells demonstrate positive nuclear staining by immunohistochemistry. Pathology report documenting ER status must be provided at enrollment.\n\n   Sites are required to report results of previous MMR and/or MSI status testing in the EDC if available.\n3. All patients must have measurable disease. Measurable disease is defined by RECIST version 1.1. Measurable disease is defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded). Each lesion must be greater than or equal to 10mm when measured by CT, MRI or caliper measurement by clinical exam; or greater than or equal to 20mm when measured by chest x-ray. Lymph nodes must be greater than or equal to 15mm in short axis when measured by CT or MRI.\n\n   Patients must have at least one \"target lesion\" to be used to assess response on this protocol as defined by RECIST 1.1. Tumors within a previously irradiated field will be designated as \"non-target\" lesions unless progression is documented or a biopsy is obtained to confirm persistence at least 90 days following completion of radiation therapy.\n4. Prior chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting for Stage I, II, or III or metastatic/recurrent/Stage IV is permitted. Prior chemoradiotherapy for a pelvic recurrence is permitted.\n\n   Prior immunotherapy and/or targeted therapy is allowed in addition to, in combination with, in lieu of, or subsequent to prior chemotherapy.\n\n   Prior hormone therapy (progesterone, tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitor) is allowed and not considered a prior line of therapy. Prior treatment with fulvestrant not allowed.\n\n   There are no limits on the number of prior lines of chemotherapy. Patients who received prior chemotherapy must have recovered (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] Grade less than or equal to 1) from the acute effects of chemotherapy except for residual alopecia or Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy prior to enrollment. A washout period of at least 21 days is required between last chemotherapy dose and initiation of therapy.\n\n   Patients who received radiotherapy must have completed and fully recovered from the acute effects of radiotherapy. A washout period of at least 14 days is required between end of radiotherapy and initiation of therapy.\n5. Patient must be able to swallow oral medications.\n6.

Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined below NOTE: Institutional/laboratory upper limit of normal = ULN Institutional/laboratory lower limit of normal = LLN\n\n   Bone marrow function:\n   * Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 1000/mcl\n   * Platelets greater than or equal to 100,000 cells/mcl\n   * Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 8 g/dL (Patients may receive erythrocyte transfusions to achieve this hemoglobin level at the discretion of the investigator. Initial treatment must not begin earlier than the day after erythrocyte transfusion).\n\n   Renal function:\n\n   • Creatinine Clearance ≥ 35 mL/min using Cockcroft-Gault formula\n\n   Pancreatic function:\n   * Fasting Serum amylase ≤ 2 × ULN\n   * Fasting Serum lipase ≤ ULN\n\n   Hepatic function:\n   * Bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN (Patients with Gilbert's syndrome with a total bilirubin ≤2 times ULN and direct bilirubin within normal limits are permitted).\n   * ALT (alanine aminotransferase) and AST (aspartate aminotransferase) less than or equal to 3 x ULN\n   * Albumin greater than or equal to 2.8 g/dL\n9. Patients must have signed an approved informed consent and authorization permitting release of personal health information.\n10. Patients must be at least 18 years of age.\n11. Patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test prior to the study entry and be practicing a highly effective form of contraception during the study treatment and for 8 weeks after stopping the treatment.\n\nHighly effective contraception methods include combination of any of the following (NOTE: Estrogen containing contraceptives are prohibited):\n\n* Use of oral, injected, or implanted hormonal contraceptives or;\n* Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS);\n* Barrier methods of contraception: condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository;\n* Total abstinence or;\n* Male/female sterilization. Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child-bearing potential if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g., age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks prior to registration. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child-bearing potential.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be FEMALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
