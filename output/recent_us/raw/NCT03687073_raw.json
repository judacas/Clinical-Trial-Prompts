Renal: Creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min as determined by Cockcroft Gault (using actual body weight).\n    4.

For women of childbearing potential who are sexually active with a non-sterilized male partner: must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 14 days before study treatment initiation. In addition, agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use one highly effective method of birth control or two effective contraceptive methods, as defined in the protocol from the time of screening until 7 months after the last dose of study treatments. Female patients must agree to refrain from egg cell donation and breastfeeding during this same period.\n15. Male participants who intend to be sexually active with a female partner of childbearing potential must be surgically sterile or use highly effective contraceptive methods, or two effective contraceptive methods, as defined in the protocol from the time of screening until 4 months after the last dose of T-DXd or 7 months after the last dose of PHESGO to prevent pregnancy in a partner. Male participants must not donate or bank sperm during this same period. Not engaging in heterosexual activity (sexual abstinence) for the duration of the study and drug washout period is an acceptable practice if this is the preferred usual lifestyle of the participant the last dose of study treatments.\n16. Patient must be accessible for treatment and follow-up.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "An individual who meets ANY of the following criteria will be excluded from participation in this trial:\n\n1.
