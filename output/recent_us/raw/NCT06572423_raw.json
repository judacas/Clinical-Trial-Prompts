The biopsiable lesion can be the same as the evaluable lesion for response by RECIST 1.1\n* HER2 antibody conjugated to a topoisomerase 1 inhibitor agents as well as other therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic; thus, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for at least 1 month after the last dose of neratinib, or at least 7 months after the last dose of DS-8201a, whichever is longer (women of childbearing potential [WOCBP] only). Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 3 months after the last dose of neratinib, or 4 months after completion of DS-8021a administration, whichever is longer\n* Women of non-child-bearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea (in questionable cases, a blood sample with simultaneous follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH] > 40 mIU/mL and estradiol < 40 pg/mL [< 147 pmol/L] is confirmatory) are eligible. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception methods outlined for women of child-bearing potential if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method\n* Male subjects must not freeze or donate sperm starting at screening and throughout the study period, and at least 4 months after the final study drug administration.

If treatment with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine treatment is absolutely required, study treatment must be interrupted. If chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine is administered, then a wash-out period of more than 14 days is required before restarting study treatment\n  * Receipt of live, attenuated vaccine (messenger ribonucleic acid [mRNA] and replication deficient adenoviral vaccines are not considered attenuated live vaccines) within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug\n* Patients with a history of (non-infectious) interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis that required steroids, has current ILD/pneumonitis, or where suspected ILD/pneumonitis cannot be ruled out by imaging at screening\n* Patients with clinically severe pulmonary compromise resulting from intercurrent pulmonary illnesses including, but not limited to, any underlying pulmonary disorder (i.e. pulmonary emboli within three months of the study enrollment, severe asthma, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), restrictive lung disease, pleural effusion, etc.), and any autoimmune, connective tissue or inflammatory disorders with potential pulmonary involvement (i.e. rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren's, sarcoidosis, etc.), or prior pneumonectomy\n* Patients with history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to DS-8201a, the inactive ingredients in the drug product, or neratinib\n* Patients who have a history of severe hypersensitivity reactions to other monoclonal antibodies\n* Patients receiving any medications or substances that are moderate or strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein are ineligible. Avoid concomitant use with proton pump inhibitors and P-glycoprotein substrates. Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product\n* Patients with a medical history of myocardial infarction within 6 months before enrollment, or symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF) (New York Heart Association class II to IV)\n* Patients with a corrected QT interval (QTc) prolongation to > 470 ms (females) or > 450 ms (males) based on average of the screening triplicate 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG)\n* Patients with clinically significant corneal disease in the opinion of the investigator\n* Patients with a pleural effusion, ascites, or pericardial effusion that requires drainage, peritoneal shunt, or cell-free and concentrated ascites reinfusion therapy (CART).

Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with DS-8201a, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with DS-8201a. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study\n* Prior treatment with neratinib or DS-8201a\n* Clinically significant chronic gastrointestinal disorder with diarrhea as a major symptom; G2 or greater diarrhea at baseline. Please contact the study PI for any patient with more than two episodes of diarrhea per day averaged over at least a 7 day period at time of screening to determine whether the diarrhea would be considered clinically significant\n* Inability to swallow tablets\n* Patients with active additional malignancy or a personal history of additional malignancy that may affect outcome of disease under treatment (patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen at the discretion of the treating investigator are allowed)\n* Patients with prior allogeneic organ transplantation including allogeneic stem cell transplantation",
