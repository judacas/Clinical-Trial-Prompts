Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of tiragolumab in combination with atezolizumab in patients <18 years of age, children are excluded from this study.\n* ECOG performance status of 0-1.\n* Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:\n\n  * ANC > 1.5 x 109 /L (1500/L) without granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support.\n  * Lymphocyte count > 0.5 x 109 /L (500/L).\n  * Platelet count > 100 x 109 /L (100,000/L) without transfusion.\n  * Hemoglobin > 90 g/L (9 g/dL).\n  * Patients may be transfused to meet this criterion.\n  * AST, ALT, and ALP < 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN).\n  * Total bilirubin < 1.5 x ULN with the following exception:\n  * Patients with known Gilbert disease: total bilirubin < 3 x ULN.\n  * Creatinine clearance > 45 mL/min (calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault formula).\n  * Serum albumin > 25 g/L (2.5 g/dL).\n  * For patients not receiving therapeutic anticoagulation: INR and aPTT < 1.5 x ULN.\n  * For patients receiving therapeutic anticoagulation: stable anticoagulant regimen.\n\nIs able to provide archival or fresh tissues for correlative analysis with obtainable results.\n\n* Negative HIV test at screening with the following exception: individuals with a positive HIV test at screening are eligible provided they are stable on anti-retroviral therapy, have a CD4+ T cell count > 200/L, and have an undetectable viral load.\n* Negative hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) test at screening\n* Positive hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb) test at screening, or negative HBsAb at screening accompanied by either of the following:\n\n  * Negative total hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb).\n  * Positive total HBcAb test followed by quantitative hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA < 500 IU/mL.\n  * The HBV DNA test will be performed only for patients who have a negative HBsAg test, a negative HBsAb test, and a positive total HBcAb test.\n* Negative hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody test at screening, or positive HCV antibody test followed by a negative HCV RNA test at screening\n\n  - The HCV RNA test will be performed only for patients who have a positive HCV antibody test.\n* Patients with treated brain metastases are eligible if follow-up brain imaging after central nervous system (CNS)-directed therapy shows no evidence of progression.\n\nPatients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen are eligible for this trial.\n\n* Patients with known history or current symptoms of cardiac disease, or history of treatment with cardiotoxic agents, should have a clinical risk assessment of cardiac function using the New York Heart Association Functional Classification. To be eligible for this trial, patients should be class 2B or better.\n* Patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding.\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n* For women of childbearing potential: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use contraception:\n\n  * Women must remain abstinent or use contraceptive methods with a failure rate of < 1% per year during the treatment period and for 90 days after the final dose of tiragolumab, 5 months after the final dose of atezolizumab.\n  * A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarchal, has not reached a postmenopausal state (> 12 continuous months of amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone surgical sterilization (i.e., removal of ovaries, fallopian tubes, and/or uterus) or another cause as determined by the investigator (e.g., Müllerian agenesis). Per this definition, a woman with a tubal ligation is considered to be of childbearing potential. The definition of childbearing potential may be adapted for alignment with local guidelines or regulations.\n  * Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of < 1% per year include bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, hormonal contraceptives that inhibit ovulation, hormone-releasing intrauterine devices, and copper intrauterine devices.\n\nThe reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not adequate methods of contraception. If required per local guidelines or regulations, locally recognized adequate methods of contraception and information about the reliability of abstinence will be described in the local Informed Consent Form.\n\nFor men: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use a condom, and agreement to refrain from donating sperm, as defined below:\n\n* With a female partner of childbearing potential, men who are not surgically sterile must remain abstinent or use a condom plus an additional contraceptive method that together result in a failure rate of < 1% per year during the treatment period, for 90 days after the final dose of tiragolumab. Men must refrain from donating sperm during this same period.\n* With a pregnant female partner, men must remain abstinent or use a condom during the treatment period for 90 days after the final dose of tiragolumab, and per the requirements of local label after the final dose of paclitaxel, pemetrexed, gemcitabine, carboplatin, or cisplatin to avoid exposing the embryo.\n* The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not adequate methods of contraception. If required per local guidelines or regulations, locally recognized adequate methods of contraception and information about the reliability of abstinence will be described in the local Informed Consent Form.\n\nFor Cohort A: Patients should have BostonGene Tumor Portrait testing that demonstrates either Immune-Enriched (IE/F) or Immune-Enriched, Non-Fibrotic (IE) subtypes.\n\n● For Cohort B: Patients should have BostonGene Tumor Portrait testing that demonstrates either Fibrotic (F) or Desert (D) subtypes.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
