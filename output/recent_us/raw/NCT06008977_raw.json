    "exclusion_criteria": "* Prior therapeutic intervention with any anti-cancer agents; localized radiotherapy ≤ 20 Gy total dose is permissible if occurred ≥ 4 weeks prior to first dose of study medication.\n\n  * Participants must have at least one non-irradiated target lesion\n* Concurrent enrollment in another therapeutic investigational study\n* Vaccinated with live vaccines within 4 weeks of the first dose of study drug\n* Current evidence of central nervous system involvement by the lymphoma\n* Grade 3b or transformed FL\n* History of prior malignancy except:\n\n  * Malignancy treated with curative intent and no known active disease present for ≥ 2 years prior to initiation of therapy on current study\n  * Adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer or lentigo maligna (melanoma in situ) without evidence of disease\n  * Asymptomatic prostate cancer managed with \"watch and wait\" strategy or hormonal therapy\n* Uncontrolled active systemic infection\n* Absolute lymphocyte count > 5,000/uL\n* Active hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Patients with past HBV infection (defined as negative hepatitis B virus surface protein antigen [HbsAg] and positive hepatitis B core antibody [HbcAb]) are eligible if HBV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is undetectable. Patients who are positive for HCV antibody are eligible if polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is negative for HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA). Testing to be done only in patients suspected of having infections or exposures\n* Known active human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Subjects who have an undetectable or unquantifiable HIV viral load with CD4 > 200 and are on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) medication are allowed.
