    "exclusion_criteria": "* Life expectancy ≤ 4 months in the judgment of the treating clinician\n* Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related illness (HIV-positive subjects on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with oral THU-Dec. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in subjects receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.\n* Pregnancy or breastfeeding (pregnant or breastfeeding women are excluded from this study because oral THU-Dec has the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown, but potential, risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with oral THU-Dec, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with oral THU-Dec.\n* Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric conditions or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study drug administration, or may interfere with the interpretation of study results, and in the judgment of the investigator would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study.\n* Receiving other investigational agent",
