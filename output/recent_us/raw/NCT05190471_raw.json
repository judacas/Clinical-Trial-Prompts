An exception to this criterion will be made for patients with sarcoma histological subtypes for which there is no known standard systemic therapy (e.g., epithelioid sarcoma). Treatment naive patients may be enrolled if they have refused standard systemic treatment.

Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN or a measured or calculateda* creatinine clearance ≥ 60mL/min for subject with creatinine levels > 1.5 x institutional ULN (Note: Creatinine clearance need not be determined if the baseline serum creatinine is within normal limits. GFR can also be used in place of creatinine or CrCl) X. International Normalized Ratio (INR) or Prothrombin Time (PT) ≤1.5 X ULN unless subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants XI. Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) ≤ 1.5 x ULN unless subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT and PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants\n\n  *aCreatinine clearance should be calculated per institutional standard\n* Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative serum pregnancy testing at screening visit and within 72 hours prior to the first dose of study medication\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including active infection requiring systemic therapy or symptomatic congestive heart failure within 6 months\n* Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least four weeks prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using steroids for at least 7 days prior to trial treatment. This exception does not include carcinomatous meningitis which is excluded regardless of clinical stability\n* Evidence of clinically significant immunosuppression such as the following:\n\n  * Primary immunodeficiency state such as Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Disease\n  * Concurrent opportunistic infection\n  * Receiving systemic immunosuppressive therapy (> 2 weeks) including oral steroid doses > 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent within 7 days prior to enrollment. However, in the setting of non-immune mediated indications for use, chronic/active low dose steroid use may be permitted at the discretion of the principal investigator\n* Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease\n* History or evidence of symptomatic autoimmune disease (e.g., pneumonitis, glomerulonephritis, vasculitis, or other), or history of active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment (i.e., use of corticosteroids, immunosuppressive drugs or biological agents used for treatment of autoimmune diseases) in past 2 years prior to enrollment. Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine for hypothyroidism, insulin for diabetes or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency) is not considered a form of systemic treatment for autoimmune disease\n* Active herpetic skin lesions or prior complications of herpetic infection\n* Require intermittent or chronic treatment with an intravenous or oral antiherpetic drug (e.g., acyclovir), other than intermittent topical use\n* Has known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA [qualitative] is detected)\n* Received live vaccine or live-attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to enrollment. Note: Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed\n* Has a known history of active TB (Bacillus Tuberculosis)\n* Female subject is pregnant or breast-feeding, or planning to become pregnant or male subject is planning to father a child within the projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit, during study treatment and through 3 months after the last dose of talimogene laherparepvec or 4 months after the last dose of pembrolizumab, whichever is later\n* Male and female subjects of childbearing potential who are unwilling to use acceptable method(s) of effective contraception during study treatment and through 3 months after the last dose of talimogene laherparepvec and 4 months after the last dose of pembrolizumab.
