    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Patients must be > 12 months and < 39 years of age at the time of study enrollment.\n2. Diagnosis:\n\n   * Cohort A: Newly Diagnosed DIPG\n\n     * Patients with newly-diagnosed DIPG with typical MRI findings (tumors with a pontine epicenter and diffuse involvement of at least 2/3 of the pons) with or without biopsy and have completed radiation therapy (RT) within 28 to 35 calendar day prior to start of therapy.\n     * Patients must have started RT within 31 calendar days of radiographic diagnosis (for non-biopsied DIPG patients only) or definitive surgery, whichever is later.\n\n       * If a biopsy was performed, the date of surgical biopsy will be considered the date of definitive diagnostic surgery; if a patient underwent two upfront surgeries [e.g., biopsy then debulking], this is the date of the second surgery)\n     * Patients must have received RT, but no other anti-cancer therapy other than surgery, and/or steroids prior to enrollment.\n   * Cohort B: progressive/refractory/recurrent DIPG or H3K27-altered HGG\n\n     * Patients with DIPG (no biopsy required) or pathologically-confirmed (at diagnosis or recurrence) extra-pontine H3K27-altered HGG who have progressive, refractory or recurrent disease following frontline treatment that included at least focal RT. Patients with refractory disease must have completed RT >6 months prior to study enrollment.\n     * Patients with progressive disease only at the primary site(s) must have completed RT more than 3 months prior to enrollment.\n     * Patients with progressive disease only at the primary site(s) who completed radiation therapy 3 to 6 months prior to enrollment must have had at least one follow up MRI to confirm progression (rather than pseudo- progression)\n     * Patients with progressive disease due to the development a new metastatic site are eligible as long as eligibility criteria 3 (disease status) and 5 (prior RT) are met.\n     * Patients with metastatic disease are eligible.\n3. Disease Status\n\n   * Cohort A: patients may have any disease status but must have completed initial radiation therapy (RT) before enrollment.\n   * Cohort B: Patients must have measurable disease assessable by MRI imaging. Patients may have metastatic disease. Lesions irradiated within the last 6 months are not considered measurable unless they show definitive progression following RT.\n4. Performance Level: Karnofsky Performance Scale score ≥ 50% for patients > 16 years of age and Lansky Performance Scale score > 50% for patients ≤ 16 years of age (applies to all patients) Note: Patients who are unable to walk because of paralysis, but who are capable of using a wheelchair, will be considered ambulatory for the purpose of assessing the performance score.\n5. Prior anti-cancer therapy:\n\n   * For Cohort A ONLY:\n   * Patients must not have received any prior therapy other than surgery, radiation (focal to disease) and/or steroids (dexamethasone with goal to wean dexamethasone throughout protocol therapy).\n   * Patients must enroll and start treatment on study between 28 and 35 calendar days post-completion of RT.\n   * Patients must have started RT within 31 calendar days of initial diagnosis (defined as the date of diagnostic biopsy or resection; if a patient underwent two upfront surgeries [e.g., biopsy then resection or debulking], this is the date of the second surgery).\n   * Radiotherapy must have been administered at standard dose of 54 Gy for DIPG patients. Any variances in the radiotherapy dose within 10% of the standard doses outlined above will be discussed with the Study Chair (or their delegate) to confirm eligibility prior to study enrollment.\n   * For Cohort B ONLY: Patients must have fully recovered from adverse events due to prior treatment with investigational or conventional agents must have recovered to a severity of Grade 0 or Grade 1 (per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 or higher), with the exception of alopecia.\n\n   Notes to the above for Cohort B: Patients with chronic Grade 2 toxicities may be eligible per discretion of the Investigator and Sponsor (e.g., Grade 2 chemotherapy-induced neuropathy). Grade 2 or 3 toxicities from prior anti-tumor therapy that are considered irreversible - defined as having been present and stable for > 6 months (such as ifosfamide-related proteinuria) may be allowed if they are not otherwise described in the exclusion criteria AND there is agreement to allow by both the Investigator and Sponsor.)\n\n   The wash out period between the prior anti-cancer chemotherapy, and first dose of ACT001 (cycle 1 day 1) must be:\n   1. Myelosuppressive chemotherapy: At least 21 days after the last dose of myelosuppressive chemotherapy (42 days if prior nitrosourea).\n   2. Hematopoietic growth factors: At least 14 days after the last dose of a long-acting growth factor (e.g. Neulasta) or 7 days for short-acting growth factor.\n   3. Biologic (anti-neoplastic agent): At least 7 days after the last dose of a biologic agent. For agents that have known adverse events occurring beyond 7 days after administration, this period must be extended beyond the time during which adverse events are known to occur. The duration of this interval must be discussed with the study chair.\n   4. Immunotherapy: At least 42 days after the completion of any type of immunotherapy, e.g. tumor vaccines.\n   5. Monoclonal antibodies: > 21 days must have elapsed from the infusion of last dose of antibody and toxicity related to antibody therapy must be recovered to Grade ≤ 1\n   6. Radiation therapy:\n\n      * For Cohort B, patients with refractory disease must have received their last fraction of frontline craniospinal or focal RT > 6 months prior to study enrollment. Patients that have received re-irradiation for progression must have received their last fraction of focal radiation >6 weeks or craniospinal radiation >6 weeks prior to study enrollment.\n   7. Stem Cell Transplant: Patients must be ≥ 3 months since autologous stem cell transplant. Patients who received allogenic stem cell transplant or solid organ transplant are not eligible for study\n6. Organ Function Requirements (applies to all patients)\n\n   1. Adequate bone marrow function defined as:\n\n      * Peripheral absolute neutrophil count (ANC) > 1000/mm³\n      * Platelet count > 100,000/mm³ (transfusion independent, defined as not receiving platelet transfusions for at least 7 days prior to enrollment)\n   2.
