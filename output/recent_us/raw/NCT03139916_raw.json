    "official_title": "A Phase II/III, Multisite, Randomized Master Protocol for a Global Trial of BNT327 in Combination With Chemotherapy and Other Investigational Agents in First-line Non-small Cell Lung Cancer",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Have histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of Stage IIIB or IIIC (who are not amenable to curative surgery or radiotherapy) or Stage IV NSCLC per the Union Internationale contre le Cancer/American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system, 8th edition without actionable EGFR mutation or anaplastic lymphoma kinase rearrangement.\n* Have at least one measurable lesion as the targeted lesion based on RECIST v1.1. Lesions treated after prior local treatment (radiotherapy, ablation, interventional procedures, etc.) are generally not considered as target lesions. If the lesion with prior local treatment is the only targeted lesion, evidence-based radiology must be provided to demonstrate disease progression (the single bone metastasis or the single central nervous system metastasis should not be considered as a measurable lesion).\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.\n* Adequate organ function.\n\nKey\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Have histologically or cytologically confirmed NSCLC with small-cell lung cancer histologic component.\n* Have received any of the following therapies or drugs within the noted time intervals prior to study treatment:\n\n  * Participants who received prior treatment with anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody, or PD(L)-1/VEGF bispecific antibody or received platinum-based chemotherapy and/or anti-PD(L)-1 as part of adjuvant or neoadjuvant treatment\n  * Have received systemic corticosteroids (at a dosage greater than 10 mg/day of prednisone or an equivalent dose of other corticosteroids) within 14 days prior to the initiation of study treatment. Note: local, intranasal, intraocular, intra-articular or inhaled corticosteroids, short-term use (â‰¤7 days) of corticosteroids for prophylaxis (e.g., prevention of contrast agent allergy) or treatment of non-autoimmune conditions (e.g., delayed hypersensitivity reactions caused by exposure to allergens) are allowed.\n* Have uncontrolled hypertension or poorly controlled diabetic conditions prior to study treatment.\n* Have a serious non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture. This includes history (within 6 months prior to study entry) or risk of abdominal fistula, tracheoesophageal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation, or intra-abdominal abscess. In addition, the participant must have undergone correction (or spontaneous healing) of the perforation/fistula and/or the underlying process causing fistula/perforation.\n* Participants with evidence of major coagulation disorders or other significant risks of hemorrhage.\n* Have superior vena cava syndrome or symptoms of spinal cord compression.\n\nNOTE: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.",
