    "official_title": "Exercise for Tumor Suppressive Impact in Black Men With Prostate Cancer on Active Surveillance: The REMOVE Trial",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Age â‰¥18 years; due to the rarity of the disease in those <18 years, this age bracket will not be included\n* Self-identify as Black\n* Diagnosed with early-stage (e.g., very-low to favorable-intermediate grade), localized prostate cancer\n* Initiating or having been undergoing active surveillance\n* No plans for invasive treatment for their prostate cancer in the following 16 weeks from the time of enrollment\n* Medical clearance to perform exercise intervention and testing by their treating urologist\n* No uncontrolled medical conditions that could be exacerbated with exercise\n* Ability to communicate and complete written forms in English\n* Participate in less than or equal to 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous aerobic exercise per week over the past month\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign informed consent prior to any study-related procedures\n* Willing to travel to Dana-Farber Cancer Institute for necessary data collection\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be MALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Receiving any invasive curative-intent treatment for prostate cancer, including surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and hormonal therapy. This study is to exclusively target patients on active surveillance who are not receiving curative cancer treatment and to examine the effects of the intervention on biochemical progression of existing prostate tumor.\n* Patients with metastasis and/or other active malignancies (except basal cell carcinoma) and/or receiving treatment for those malignancies. This study is to exclusively target patients with early-stage prostate cancer on active surveillance to investigate the effects of the intervention on biochemical progression of prostate tumor, as such other active malignancies or any relevant treatment may contaminate the study results.\n* Participate in more than 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous aerobic exercise per week over the past month. This study targets insufficiently active persons to assess the effect of the described exercise intervention, where additional exercise done regularly will contaminate the intervention effects.\n* Unstable comorbidities that prevent participation in moderate-to-vigorous intensity exercise. Patients with unstable comorbidities may develop unexpected adverse events from exercise. For the purpose of patients' safety, as well as because part of this study involves remote, home-based exercise where close supervision is not possible, patients with unstable medical conditions are excluded.\n* Subjects who in the opinion of the investigator may not be able to comply with the safety monitoring requirements of the study.",
