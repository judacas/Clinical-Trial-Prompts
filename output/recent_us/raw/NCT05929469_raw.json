    "official_title": "A Phase I Study With Expansion Cohort of Concurrent GDC-0084 With Radiation Therapy for Patients With Solid Tumor Brain Metastases or Leptomeningeal Metastases Harboring PI3K Pathway Mutations",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Histologically confirmed solid tumor malignancies harboring PIK3CA mutations which include mutations in any of the following genes: PIK3CA, PIK3CB, PIK3CD, PIK3CG, PIK3R1, PIK3R2, PIK3R3, PIK3C2G, PIK3C3, INPP4A, INPP4B, INPPL1, INPP5D, PTEN, AKT1, AKT2, AKT3, and MTOR.\n* Brain metastases and/or leptomeningeal metastases involving the brain demonstrated by MR imaging of the brain. For patients with brain metastases, measurable lesion by RANO-BM is required28. Patients with spine leptomeningeal metastases are eligible for the study if they have leptomeningeal metastases of the brain demonstrated by MRI imaging of the brain.\n* KPS ≥ 70\n* Age ≥ 18 years\n* Able to provide informed consent.\n* If a patient is on corticosteroid, he/she must be on a stable daily dose of < 4mg dexamethasone or equivalent. Patient does not need to be given corticosteroid as prophylaxis if not clinically indicated.\n* No limit to prior therapies with the last systemic therapy ≥ 1 week from initiation of protocol therapy. Systemic therapy can resume after completion of protocol DLT assessment period.\n* Patients with prior SRS are eligible, provided that there are new, non-irradiated brain lesions or leptomeningeal metastases. Patients must be ≥ 3 months post prior cranial radiation therapy.\n* Patients with seizure history related to brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases controlled on antiepileptic medications are eligible.\n* Patient at reproductive potential must agree to practice an effective contraceptive method\n* Patient must be able to swallow and retain oral medication\n* Adequate organ function as assessed by laboratory tests.\n* Adequate bone marrow function\n\n  * Hemoglobin ≥ 8g/dL\n  * Absolute neutrophil count ≥1,000/mm^3\n  * Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm^3\n* Adequate liver function\n\n  * Bilirubin ≤1.5 times upper limit normal (ULN)\n  * AST and ALT ≤ 2.5 times ULN\n  * Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2 times ULN\n* Adequate renal function ° BUN and Creatinine ≤ 1.5 times ULN\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Previous radiotherapy to the intended treatment site that precludes developing a treatment plan that respects tissue tolerances\n* Patients with brain metastases eligible for single fraction stereotactic radiation therapy\n* Serious medical co-morbidities precluding radiotherapy\n* Insulin-treated diabetes; subjects with diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance that is not treated with insulin may be enrolled\n* QT interval ≥ 450 msec on EKG\n* Cardiac dysfunction defined as: myocardial infarction within 6 months of study entry, NYHA Class II/III/IV heart failure, unstable angina or unstable cardiac arrhythmias\n* Known hypersensitivity or intolerance to GDC-0084 or to any other inhibitor of the PI3K/ Akt/ mTOR pathway\n* Past medical history of interstitial lung disease, drug-induced ILD, radiation pneumonitis that required steroid treatment, or any evidence of clinically active interstitial lung disease\n* Subject receiving any medications or substances that are moderate and/or potent enzyme inducers or inhibitors which may have an effect on the metabolism of GDC-0084.\n* Pregnant or lactating women.",
