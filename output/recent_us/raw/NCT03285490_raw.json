Must have a life expectancy of greater than 3 months, as determined by the investigator.\n13. Stage 2 patients must agree to have a biopsy of the primary tumor or metastatic tissue at baseline, and there must be a lesion that can be biopsied with acceptable clinical risk (as judged by the investigator).\n\n    1. Patients with unsuccessful baseline biopsies may undergo an additional biopsy attempt (at the same or a different site, determined by the investigator).\n    2. If no metastatic site can be safely biopsied, a biopsy of the primary tumor is acceptable, but must be approved by the principal investigator.\n    3. Baseline tumor biopsy may be omitted if the tumor is inaccessible and/or a biopsy is thought to post high procedural risk due to location or other factors; or\n\n       ••If participants have only 1 small (<1.5cm) measurable lesion per RECIST 1.1, and no non-target lesions amenable to biopsy\n    4. If fresh tumor tissue cannot be collected, the overall study (lead-site) PI may approve the use of archival tissue. The use of archival tissue in lieu of a fresh tumor biopsy is encouraged and will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and must be approved by the overall study (lead-site) PI.\n\n       * Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks are preferred to slides. Newly obtained biopsies are preferred to archived tissue.\n14. Male participants are eligible to participate if they agree to the following starting with the first dose of study therapy through 7 days after the last dose of lenvatinib (and refrain from donating sperm during this period).

Note: Medically controlled arrhythmia would be permitted\n6. Radiographic evidence of major blood vessel encasement/invasion/infiltration (e.g., carotid artery) or intratumoral cavitation. The degree of tumor invasion/infiltration of major blood vessels should be considered because of the potential risk of severe hemorrhage associated with tumor shrinkage/necrosis following lenvatinib therapy.\n\n   *Portal vein or inferior vena cava involvement by tumor is allowed at the discretion of the investigator (and is distinguished from invasion through the wall of a vessel).\n7. Active hemoptysis or tumor bleeding (bright red blood of at least 0.5 teaspoons) within 3 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug.\n8.

Known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis.\n\n    1. Individuals with new or progressive asymptomatic small (<1 cm) brain metastases are eligible if the treating physician determines that immediate CNS-specific treatment is not required and is unlikely to be required during the first cycle of therapy.\n    2. Participants with previously treated brain metastases (e.g., whole brain radiation therapy, surgery, or radiosurgery) may participate provided they are radiologically stable (i.e., without evidence of progression by imaging) for at least 4 weeks by repeat imaging (note that the repeat imaging should be performed during study screening), clinically stable and without requirement of steroid treatment for at least 14 days prior to the first dose of study intervention.\n13.

Participants with urine protein creatinine ratio (UPCR) >1 or proteinuria >-2+ (>=100 mg/dL) on urinalysis/urine dipstick testing will undergo 24-hour urine collection for quantitative assessment of proteinuria. Participants with urine protein >=1 g/24 hour will be ineligible.\n    2. Prolongation of QTc interval to > 480 milliseconds (ms). Investigator may use the average of 3 triplicates if screening QTc > 450 ms. Rescreening is allowed after discontinuation of any drugs known to prolong QTc. NOTE: If the QTcF is prolonged to >480 ms in the presence of a pacemaker, the participant will not be excluded if the participant is considered at low risk for ventricular arrhythmias by the investigator.\n    3.

Patients who are currently receiving medication with a known risk of prolonging the QT interval inducing Torsade's de Pointes (TdP) and the treatment cannot either be discontinued or switched to a different medication prior to starting study drug treatment. A list of prohibited drugs with a known risk of TdP is provided in Appendix 6.\n31. Biologic response modifiers (e.g., granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) within 4 weeks before study entry. Chronic erythropoietin therapy is permitted provided that no dose adjustments were made within 2 months before the first dose of study drug.\n32.
