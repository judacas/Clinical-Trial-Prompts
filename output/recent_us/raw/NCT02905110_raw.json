    "exclusion_criteria": "* A WOCBP who has a positive urine pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to treatment. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required. Note: in the event that 72 hours have elapsed between the screening pregnancy test and the first dose of study treatment, another pregnancy test (urine or serum) must be performed and must be negative in order for subject to start receiving study medication\n* Has received prior therapy with an anti-IL1beta\n* Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or has required active treatment within the past year. Note: Participants with basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or carcinoma in situ (e.g. breast carcinoma, cervical cancer in situ) that have undergone potentially curative therapy are not excluded\n* Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy\n* Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial\n* Is pregnant or breastfeeding or expecting to conceive children within the projected duration of the study, starting with the screening visit through 6 months after the last dose of trial treatment\n* Is receiving the following therapies during the screening and treatment phases (including retreatment for post-complete response relapse) of this trial: antineoplastic systemic chemotherapy or biological therapy, immunotherapy not specified by this protocol, chemotherapy not specified by this protocol, investigational agents other than canakinumab\n* Has received live vaccines within 30 days prior to first dose of study treatment and while participating in the study. Examples of live vaccines include but are not limited to: measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster, yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) and typhoid vaccine. (Note: Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (eg FluMist are live attenuated vaccines are not allowed)",
