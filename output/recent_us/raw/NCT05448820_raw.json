    "miscellaneous_criteria": "Vulnerable populations: Three groups (prisoners, pregnant women and unborn fetuses, and children) will not be included in this study because there may be unknown risks. Prisoners will be excluded because if a survivor or a family member were a current prisoner, it would be impractical to expect an individual to fully participate for 6 months.\n\nPregnant women and unborn fetuses will be excluded because there may be unknown risks.\n\nInclusion of adolescents and children: Adolescents and children will be excluded also because they are younger than the Inclusion Criteria requirement of 21 years of age. Strategies to obtain representation of children in this study would not be appropriate, as they do not get the disease. Also, they will be excluded from participating as family members.\n\nTable 3.
