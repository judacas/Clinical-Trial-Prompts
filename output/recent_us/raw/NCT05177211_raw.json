Participants with medically-controlled active or chronic neurological diseases can be enrolled in the study as per investigator assessment, provided that their condition will allow them to comply with the requirements of the protocol.\n* Significant underlying illness that in the opinion of the investigator would be expected to prevent completion of the study.\n* Any medical condition that in the judgment of the investigator would make intramuscular injection unsafe.\n* Any history of dementia or any medical condition that moderately or severely impairs cognition.\n\nPrior/Concomitant therapy\n\n* Use of any investigational or non-registered product other than the study vaccine during the period beginning 30 days before the first dose of study vaccine, or planned use during the study period.\n* Planned or actual administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol in the period starting 30 days before each dose and ending 30 days after each dose of study vaccine administration, with the exception of inactivated, split virion and subunit influenza vaccines which can be administered up to 14 days before or from 14 days after each study vaccination.\n* Previous vaccination with an RSV vaccine.\n* Administration of long-acting immune-modifying drugs or planned administration at any time during the study period.\n* Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products or plasma derivatives during the period starting 90 days before the first dose of study vaccine or planned administration during the study period.\n* Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 consecutive days in total) of immunosuppressants or other immune-modifying drugs during the period starting 90 days prior to the first vaccine dose or planned administration during the study period. For corticosteroids, this will mean prednisone ≥ 20 mg/day, or equivalent. Inhaled and topical steroids are allowed.\n\nPrior/Concurrent clinical study experience\n\n• Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study period, in which the participant has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a non-investigational vaccine/product.\n\nOther exclusions\n\n* History of chronic alcohol consumption and/or drug abuse as deemed by the investigator to render the potential participant unable/unlikely to provide accurate safety reports or comply with study procedures.\n* Bedridden participants.\n* Planned move during the study period that will prohibit participation in the trial until the study end. This includes:\n\n  * Planned move during the study period to another LTCF that will prohibit participation in the trial until study end.\n  * Planned move from the community to a LTCF that will prohibit participation in the trial until study end.\n* Participation of any study personnel or their immediate dependants, family, or household members.",
