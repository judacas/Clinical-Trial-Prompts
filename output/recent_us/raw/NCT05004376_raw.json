    "exclusion_criteria": "* Prior systemic therapy for MCC other than first-line aPD1 monotherapy (ie, chemotherapy)\n* Pregnancy or breastfeeding\n* Adverse events due to prior cancer therapy which are grade 3 or higher and have not resolved\n\n  °Patients with prior grade 3 or higher immune related adverse events are not eligible, even if they have resolved\n* Prior severe hypersensitivity reaction (CTCAE version 5.0 grade ≥3) to avelumab\n* Prior radiotherapy which precludes the ability to safely deliver comprehensive ablative radiation therapy in the opinion of the treating radiation oncologist and principal investigator\n\n  °Institutional guidelines for reirradiation will be used when making this determination\n* Known central nervous system metastases\n* Known clinically significant cardiovascular disease, defined as:\n\n  * Stroke or myocardial infarction within 6 months of first dose of avelumab\n  * Symptomatic congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association Class 2 or higher)\n  * Serious arrhythmia requiring anti-arrhythmic agents\n* Known Human Immunodeficiency Virus infection\n* Known Hepatitis B or C infection requiring ongoing treatment\n* Vaccination within 4 weeks of first dose of avelumab\n\n  °Inactivated vaccines are permissible\n* Iatrogenic immunosuppression with daily systemic corticosteroid equivalent of >10 mg of prednisone\n* Active autoimmune disease that may cause clinical deterioration during immunotherapy\n\n  °Including, but not limited to:\n* Inflammatory bowel disease or immune colitis\n* Immune mediated pneumonitis or pulmonary fibrosis\n* History of solid organ or hematopoietic transplant\n* Active infection requiring systemic therapy\n* Active suicidal ideation or behavior\n* Comorbid or diagnostic abnormalities which would interfere with interpretation of study results\n* Known hematopoietic cancer or dysfunction (i.e., leukemia, lymphoma)\n* Known non-MCC solid tumor with known metastasis or estimated risk of metastasis >20% within 3 months",
