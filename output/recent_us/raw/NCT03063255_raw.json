    "exclusion_criteria": "* Participants are excluded from the study if any of the following criteria apply: a WOCBP who has a positive urine pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to treatment. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required\n* Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti PD L2 agent or with an agent directed to another stimulatory or co-inhibitory T-cell receptor (eg, CTLA-4, OX 40, CD137)\n* Has received prior systemic anti-cancer therapy including investigational agents within 4 weeks prior to study treatment. Note: participants must have recovered from all adverse events (AEs) due to previous therapies to =< grade 1 or baseline. Participants with =< grade 2 neuropathy may be eligible. Note: if participant received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting study treatment\n* Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug. Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster (chicken pox), yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus Calmette - Guerin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (eg, FluMist) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed\n* Is currently participating in or has participated in a study of an investigational agent or has used an investigational device within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment. Note: participants who have entered the follow-up phase of an investigational study may participate as long as it has been 4 weeks after the last dose of the previous investigational agent\n* Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy (in dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug, with the exception of dexamethasone, that can be given the day prior (D0) until 4 days after chemotherapy (D4) up to 16 mg per day for prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea, fluid retention, and/or allergic reaction\n* Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or has required active treatment within the past 2 years. Note: participants with basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, transitional cell carcinoma of urothelial cancer, carcinoma in situ (e.g. breast carcinoma, cervical cancer in situ) that have undergone potentially curative therapy, and prostate cancer patients in active surveillance are not excluded\n* Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment\n* Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or has current pneumonitis\n* Has an active infection requiring intravenous antibiotics therapy\n* Has a known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\n* Has a known history of hepatitis B (defined as hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] reactive) or known active hepatitis C virus (defined as HCV ribonucleic acid [RNA] < 615 IU/L) infection.
