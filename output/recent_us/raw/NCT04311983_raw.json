    "exclusion_criteria": "* All individuals meeting any of the exclusion criteria at baseline will be excluded from study participation, as follows:\n\n  * Subjects with untreated CNS metastases. Subjects are eligible if CNS metastases have been adequately treated and have neurologically returned to baseline (except for residual signs or symptoms related to the CNS treatment) for at least 2 weeks prior to treatment initiation. In addition, subjects must be either off corticosteroids, or on a stable or decreasing dose of ≤10 mg daily prednisone (or equivalent) for at least 2 weeks prior to treatment initiation.\n  * Subjects with carcinomatous meningitis\n  * Anticancer treatment with radiation therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy or other antitumor treatment within 2 weeks prior to study entry\n  * Subjects who participated in an investigational drug or device study within 14 days prior to study entry\n  * Females who are pregnant or breast-feeding\n  * Unwillingness or inability to comply with the study protocol for any reason\n  * Non-oncology vaccine therapy used for prevention of infectious disease within 4 weeks of trial enrollment\n  * • History of or known or suspected autoimmune disease (exception(s): patients with vitiligo, Type I diabetes, resolved childhood atopic dermatitis, hypothyroidism, or hyperthyroidism that is clinically euthyroid at Screening are allowed). Other exceptions may be allowed following discussion with the Sponsor Medical Monitor for patients who have not received treatment for their autoimmune disorder in the past 3 years.\n  * Systemic immunosuppression, including HIV positive status with or without AIDS\n  * Skin rash (psoriasis, eczema) affecting ≥ 25% body surface area\n  * Inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's or ulcerative colitis)\n  * Ongoing or uncontrolled diarrhea within 4 weeks of trial enrollment\n  * Recent history of acute diverticulitis, intraabdominal abscess or gastrointestinal obstruction within 6 months of trial enrollment, which are known risk factors for bowel perforation\n  * Patients with congestive heart failure or recent cardiac event\n  * Evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic disease or any other concurrent condition, including psychiatric, which in the principal investigator's opinion makes it undesirable for the patient to participate in the trial or which would jeopardize compliance with the trial\n  * Any positive test for hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus indicating acute or chronic infection\n  * Known history of testing positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or known acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).\n  * Inadequate hematologic, renal or hepatic function defined by any of the following screening laboratory values: WBC ≤2000/µL; Neutrophils ≤1500/µL; Platelets ≤ 100,000/µL; hemoglobin ≤9.0 g/dL; Serum creatinine ≥1.5 x ULN or creatinine clearance ≤ 60 mL/min (using the Cockcroft Gault formula); AST/ALT ≥3 x ULN (≥ 5 x ULN if liver metastases); Total Bilirubin ≥1.5 x ULN (except subjects with Gilbert Syndrome who must have a total bilirubin level ≥ 3.0 ULN)\n  * Current, active or previous history of heavy alcohol abuse\n  * Pituitary endocrinopathy\n  * Adrenal insufficiency or excess",
