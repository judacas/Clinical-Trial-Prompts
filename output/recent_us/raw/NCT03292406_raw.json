If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required. Female patients of childbearing potential must be willing to use an adequate method of contraception for the course of the study through 120 days after the last dose of study medication. Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and preferred contraception for the patient\n* Male patients of childbearing potential must agree to use an adequate method of contraception, starting with the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy.

Legally authorized representatives may sign and give informed consent on behalf of study participants\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to prior anti-cancer therapy (i.e., have residual toxicities > grade 1) Note: Patients with grade ≤ 2 neuropathy or grade ≤ 2 alopecia are an exception to this criterion and may qualify for the study. Note: If patients received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting therapy\n* Diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy (in dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior the first dose of study drug\n* Grade ≥ 3 immune related adverse event with prior PD-1/PD-L1 blockade\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to CA-4948 and/or pembrolizumab\n* Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness, including but not limited to interstitial lung disease or active, non-infectious pneumonitis, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, or cardiac arrhythmia that would limit compliance with study requirements\n* Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents\n* Patients with carcinomatous meningitis\n* Patients with malabsorption syndrome or other conditions that would interfere with intestinal absorption\n* Has an active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e., with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment\n* Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or current pneumonitis\n* Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the patient's participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of the patient to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator\n* Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned treatment start. Seasonal flu vaccines that do not contain live virus are permitted\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because pembrolizumab is a monoclonal antibody with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with pembrolizumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with pembrolizumab. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study\n* Has known active hepatitis B (e.g., hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] reactive) or hepatitis C (e.g., hepatitis C virus [HCV] RNA [qualitative] is detected)\n* Has a known history of active tuberculosis (TB)",
