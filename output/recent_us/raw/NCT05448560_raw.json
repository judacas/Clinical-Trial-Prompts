Tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity (TRV) ≥ 3.0 meter/second(m/s) OR TRV ≥ 2.5 m/s + N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) plasma level ≥ 160 picogram per milliliter; OR documented ongoing pulmonary hypertension diagnosed from previous echocardiogram or right-sided heart catheterization with mean pulmonary artery pressure > 25 millimeter of mercury;\n  5. SCD-related chronic kidney disease (CKD)\n  6. Meet medical criteria to receive (e.g., post-cerebrovascular accident) but are contraindicated for chronic transfusions (e.g., alloimmunization, transfusion reactions)\n* Previous experience with Hydroxyurea (HU) but have shown to be unresponsive and/or intolerant or ineligible AND\n* Participants who previously received voxelotor, crizanlizumab, and/ or L-glutamine and will be discontinuing before starting dosing with pociredir:\n\n  1. Must be off voxelotor and crizanlizumab for at least 60 days prior to initiating study drug; and\n  2. Must be off L-glutamine for at least 24-hours prior to initiating study drug.\n* HbF ≤ 20% of total Hb\n* Total Hb ≥ 5.5 g/dL and ≤ 12 g/dl (males) or ≤ 10.6 g/dl (females) at screening.\n* Participant must meet both of the following laboratory values at screening:\n\n  1. Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 × 10^9 per liter (/l)\n  2. Platelets ≥ 80 × 10^9/l\n  3. Absolute reticulocyte count at screening ≥ 100 x 10^9/l.\n\nKey\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 65 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Sickle cell complication requiring care from a medical provider in the 14 days prior to starting study drug.\n* History of bone marrow transplant or human stem cell transplant or gene therapies.\n* Participants with a history of severe renal disease defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate < 30 mL/min/1.73m^2. Participants on dialysis of any kind are excluded.\n* Participants receiving regularly scheduled transfusions or therapeutic phlebotomies, or any participant who has been transfused.\n* Participant with active malignancy, or history of cancer (except for squamous cell skin cancer, basal cell skin cancer, and stage 0 cervical carcinoma in situ, with no recurrence for the last 5 years), or has an immediate family member with known or suspected familial cancer syndrome. Known presence of a chromosomal abnormality or genetic mutation that may put the participant at an increased risk of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML).\n* Participant currently on HU, or have received HU, within 60 days prior to initiating study drug.",
