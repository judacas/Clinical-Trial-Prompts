Patients may have received transfusion if > 7 days prior to registration\n  * Hemoglobin concentration of >= 8.0 g/dL within 14 days prior to registration. Patients may have received transfusion if greater than 7 days prior to registration\n  * Must have adequate liver function, as defined by:\n\n    * Normal total bilirubin (as per institutional upper limits of normal [IULN]), except if due to Gilbert's syndrome, or other documented historical elevations in serum bilirubin levels, at the discretion of the investigator, AND\n    * Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase [SGPT]) =< 2 x IULN\n  * Must have adequate renal function, as defined by:\n\n    * Creatinine clearance (CrCl) of >= 30 mL/min, as measured by a 24-hour urine collection or as estimated by the Cockcroft and Gault formula. The serum creatinine value used in the calculation must have been obtained within 35 days prior to registration.\n    * For patients with a creatinine clearance within the range of 30-45 mL/min, stability (i.e., not deteriorating) must be demonstrated over a period of 8 weeks prior to enrollment in the study\n  * Lab parameters must continue to be met at the time of registration. If parameters not met at the intended C1D1, transfusion or growth factor support may be considered in consultation with the team, if the individual is still within the screening window\n* Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) by echocardiogram >= 40%. The echocardiogram study should be obtained during screening or up to 60 days prior to consent\n* Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 14 days prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If the urine pregnancy test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required\n* Female participants of childbearing potential (FOCBP) must agree to use highly-effective method(s) of contraception during the study and for 3 months after the last dose of study drug.
