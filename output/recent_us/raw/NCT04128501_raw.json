    "inclusion_criteria": "Patients will be included in the study based on the following criteria:\n\n1. Male or non-childbearing potential females, at least 18 years of age (Female patients who meet at least one of the following criteria are defined as women of non-childbearing potential)\n\n   * ≥ 50 years old and naturally amenorrhea for ≥ 1 year\n   * Permanent premature ovarian failure confirmed by specialist gynecologist\n   * Previous bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy or hysterectomy\n   * XY karyotype, Turner's syndrome, or uterine agenesis\n2. Diagnosis of BCC with at least 3 nodular lesions that measure 0.5 cm to 5 cm in diameter, located on the head and neck, trunk or extremities.\n3. Diagnosis must be confirmed clinically at baseline with 1-2 lesions having been biopsied no sooner than 2 weeks prior to treatment.\n4. Patients who may have high burden of disease ie large lesions, who are non-surgical candidates or who refuse surgery.\n5. Non-surgical candidates, who may be able to undergo resection of selected single, individual lesion, but may not tolerate extensive surgery, may have many co morbidities, may be prone to complications.\n6. Patients in whom surgery or radiation therapy may be impractical\n7. Primary lesions may be acceptable for enrollment\n8. Within normal limit hematopoietic capacity, hepatic and renal function. Values outside those limits may be allowed at the discretion of the PI, if they are determined as not clinically significant\n9. Evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent document indicating that the subject (or legally acceptable representative) has been informed of all pertinent aspects of the trial.\n10. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document in English\n\n6.2 Exclusion Criteria\n\nPatients will be excluded from the study based on the following criteria:\n\n1. Women of childbearing potential\n2. Basal cell carcinomas of aggressive subtypes (infiltrative, morpheaform, micronodular)\n3. Any BCC that may require Mohs surgery for definitive control\n4. Subjects with porphyria's or known hypersensitivity to porphyrins\n5. Subjects with known photosensitivity diseases\n6. Subjects previously treated with a systemic photosensitizer within 4 months of screening date\n7. Subjects who desire to get pregnant a female of childbearing potential within the next 1.5 years\n8. Uncontrolled concomitant illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n9. Life expectancy less than one year\n10. Inability or unwillingness to swallow capsules\n11. Have a history of alcohol of substance abuse, unless in full remission for greater than 6 months prior to the screening visit (Day 0) when the consent form is signed.\n12. Known to be infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B or hepatitis C viruses.\n13. Having used any of the following treatment within 6 months before the baseline visit:\n\n    * hedgehog pathway inhibitor, biologics, or chemotherapy\n    * topical chemotherapy agents including Imiquimod, fluorouracil,) to the selected treatment lesion sites within 3 weeks\n14. Currently undergoing treatment with photodynamic therapy within 3 weeks before baseline visit\n15. Subjects who have received any type of solid organ transplant\n16. Subjects taking immunosuppressive medications at the screening visit.\n17. Participation in other study using an investigational or experimental therapy or procedure within 4 weeks or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) before the screening visit and/or during study participation. Subjects cannot participate in studies of other investigational or experimental therapies or procedures at any time during their participation in this study.\n18. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this study.\n19. Subjects unable or unwilling to comply with the study visit schedule and requirements of the study\n20. Subjects unable to speak and read the English language\n21. A subject who, in the opinion of the sponsor-investigator will be uncooperative or unable to comply with study procedures.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
