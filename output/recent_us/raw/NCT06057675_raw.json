    "inclusion_criteria": "* Patients must be diagnosed with a primary soft tissue sarcoma of the extremity, confirmed by MSKCC pathologic review\n* Age at the time of enrollment of ≥18 years\n* Patients must have undergone margin-negative oncologic resection of their primary tumor, as confirmed by MSKCC pathologic review\n* Patients must be able to start radiation within 3 months from time of surgery\n\n  °If patient is receiving adjuvant chemotherapy, patient must start RT no longer than 3 months past their chemo treatment.\n* Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 14 days of radiation start (or if urine test, within 24 hours of radiation start)\n* Sexually active patients of childbearing potential must agree to use effective contraception.\n* The use of chemotherapy will not be dictated by this trial. Patients are allowed to receive chemotherapy at the discretion of the disease management team (as is standard practice to make individualized decisions for each patient regarding the use of chemotherapy).\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Patients with positive margins after surgical resection as indicated by MSKCC pathologic review\n* Patients with diagnosis of superficial myxofibrosarcoma with indistinct/infiltrative borders on preoperative MRI16 (see Appendix Figure 1 for reference figure)\n* Patients with multifocal disease in the extremity\n* Patients who have received prior radiotherapy at or adjacent to the primary tumor bed\n* Patients with a differentinvasive cancer requiring active treatment at the time of enrollment.\n* Patients with any concurrent medical or psychiatric condition or disease which, in the investigator's judgment, would make them inappropriate candidates for entry into this study",
