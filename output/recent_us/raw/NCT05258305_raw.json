    "exclusion_criteria": "1. A history of another active malignancy (i.e., a second cancer) within the previous 2 years, except for localized cancers that are not related to the current cancer being treated, are considered cured, and, in the opinion of the Investigator, present a low risk of recurrence. These exceptions include but are not limited to basal or squamous cell skin cancer, superficial bladder cancer, or carcinoma in situ of the prostate, cervix, or breast.\n2. Received prior treatment with IL-12, including by intratumoral injection.\n3. Patients with primary CNS malignancies.\n4. Presence of CNS metastases that are symptomatic and/or require local CNS directed therapy (such as XRT or surgery) or increasing doses of corticosteroids within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug. Patients with treated brain metastases should be neurologically stable and receiving ≤ 10 mg per day of prednisone or equivalent prior to study entry.\n5. Significant cardiovascular disease.\n6. Significant electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities\n7. Active autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment in the past 2 years.\n8. Diagnosis of immunodeficiency, on immunosuppressive therapy, or receiving chronic systemic or enteric steroid therapy (dose > 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent).\n9. Prior receipt of an allogeneic stem cell transplant or allogeneic CAR-T cell therapy.\n10. Major surgery (excluding placement of vascular access) within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug.\n11. Investigational agent or anticancer therapy (including chemotherapy, biologic therapy, immunotherapy, anticancer Chinese medicine, or anticancer herbal remedy) within 5 half-lives or 4 weeks (whichever is shorter) prior to the first dose of study drug.\n12. Radiotherapy within 2 weeks of the start of study treatment. A 1-week washout is permitted for palliative radiation (≤ 2 weeks of radiotherapy) to non-CNS disease.\n13. Any unresolved toxicities from prior therapy greater than NCI-CTCAE version 5.0 Grade 1 at the time of starting study drug with the exception of alopecia and Grade 2 platinum therapy-related neuropathy.\n14. Use of sensitive substrates of major CYP450 isozymes.\n15. Any illness, medical condition, organ system dysfunction, or social situation (including mental illness or substance abuse), that may interfere with a patient's ability to sign the ICF, adversely affect the patient's ability to cooperate and participate in the study, or compromise interpretation of study results.\n16. Received a live vaccine within 30 days of the first dose of study drug.\n17. Active, uncontrolled systemic bacterial, viral, or fungal infection.\n18. HIV-infected participants with a history of Kaposi sarcoma and/or Multicentric Castleman Disease.\n19. Active infection with hepatitis B as determined by hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis B core antibody, or hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) testing.\n20. Active infection with hepatitis C as determined by hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody or HCV RNA by qPCR testing.\n21. Pregnant or lactating.\n22.
