Duration of targeted agents/immunotherapy is at the investigator's discretion.\n     * Participants on AC-T regimens who are prescribed with at least 4 treatments with anthracycline followed by at least 4 treatments with taxane are eligible for the study.

Willing and able to sign informed consent.\n6. Willing to comply and tolerate all study procedures including:\n\n   * Wearing the Lily device for the prescribed duration (device to be fitted before chemotherapy infusion, and worn during infusion and for at least two (2) hours and up to four (4) hours post infusion),\n   * Complete all study related questionnaires.\n   * Having photographs taken of the head at each visit.\n\nTo note:\n\n* Participants who experience a hypersensitivity reaction to chemotherapy are allowed to continue in the study if the standard doses are maintained.\n* Participants on the chemotherapy plan KEYNOTE-522 are eligible for this study.\n* If a participant is prescribed a different chemotherapy treatment plan, they may be eligible for the study only if prior Sponsor approval is obtained.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",

History of whole brain irradiation.\n4. Recent chemotherapy (≤ 2 years), which caused hair loss.\n5.
