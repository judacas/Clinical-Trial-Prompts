    "official_title": "Pilot PET Imaging Study of [89Zr]DFO-YS5 for Detecting CD46 Positive Malignancy in Multiple Myeloma",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Participants must have histologically or cytologically confirmed multiple myeloma by International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) diagnostic criteria\n* At least one positive myelomatous lesion found on 18F-FDG PET/CT or PET/MRI. A positive lesion is defined as uptake greater than liver on FDG PET, based on the Italian myeloma criteria for PET use (IMPeTUs) criteria\n* Age >= 18 years\n* Total bilirubin =< 1.5 X institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) =< 3 X ULN\n* Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) =< 3 X ULN\n* Creatinine clearance >= 60 mL/min, calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault equation\n* Ability to understand a written informed consent document, and the willingness to sign it\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Any condition that, in the opinion of the principal investigator, would impair the participants' ability to comply with study procedures or interfere with the safety of the investigational regimen\n* Individuals who are pregnant or breastfeeding/chestfeeding.\n* - Breast-feeding/chest-feeding should be discontinued before administration of [89ZR]DFO-YS5.\n* Females of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test (i.e., human chorionic gonadotropin test) within 72 hours prior to administration of [89ZR]-DFO-YS5.\n* - If the urine pregnancy test is positive or equivocal, a confirmatory serum pregnancy test is required. In such cases, the individual must be excluded from participation if the serum pregnancy result is positive.\n* - A female is considered to be of childbearing potential (regardless of sexual orientation, having undergone a tubal ligation, or remaining celibate by choice), unless it is documented that the individual meets either of the following two criteria: (1) has reached a postmenopausal state ( >= 12 continuous months of amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause); or (2) has undergone surgical sterilization (i.e., hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy for removal of uterus and/or ovaries).\n* Individuals who are pregnant or breastfeeding/chestfeeding are excluded because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse effects in the unborn/nursing child secondary to treatment of the study participant with [89ZR]-DFO-YS5",
