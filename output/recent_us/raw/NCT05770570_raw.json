Presence of clinically significant ECG abnormalities at the Screening visit, as defined by medical judgment. Note: QT corrected according to Fridericia's formula (QTcF) interval of > 450 msec in male subjects or > 470 msec in female subjects will be exclusionary. The ECG may be repeated once for confirmatory purposes if the initial value obtained exceeds the limits specified.\n14.

Any clinically significant illness in the 28 days prior to study drug administration\n16.
