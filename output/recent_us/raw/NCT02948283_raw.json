The two birth control methods can be either two barrier methods or a barrier method plus a hormonal method to prevent pregnancy. The following are considered adequate barrier methods of contraception: diaphragm, condom, copper intrauterine device, sponge, or spermicide.

    "exclusion_criteria": "* Prior radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or biologic therapy is allowed in patients with loco-regional recurrent disease, if administered at least 4 weeks prior to study enrollment\n* Prior treatment with gamma-secretase inhibitor\n* History of previous malignancy other than malignancy treated with curative intent and with no evidence of active disease >= 2 years before the first dose of study drug and of low potential risk for recurrence. Patients with the following diagnoses represents an exception and may enroll:\n\n  * Non-melanoma skin cancers with no current evidence of disease\n  * Melanoma in situ with no current evidence of disease\n  * Localized cancer of the prostate with prostate-specific antigen of < 0.1 ng/mL\n  * Treated or localized well-differentiated thyroid cancer\n  * Treated cervical carcinoma in situ\n  * Treated ductal/lobular carcinoma in situ of the breast\n* Current or recent (within 2 months of investigational product administration) gastrointestinal disease such as disorders that increase the risk of diarrhea (e.g.: inflammatory bowel disease). Non-chronic conditions (e.g., infectious diarrhea) that are completely resolved for at least 2 weeks prior to starting investigational product are not exclusionary\n* Evidence of clinically significant bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy (in the absence of therapeutic anticoagulation)\n* Evidence of uncontrolled, active infection, requiring systemic anti-bacterial, anti-viral or anti-fungal therapy =< 7 days prior to administration of investigational product such as known active infection with hepatitis B and hepatitis C (HCV) at Screening\n* Symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastases. Patients with asymptomatic CNS metastases as well as those with previously treated CNS metastases are eligible for enrollment in the study if at least four weeks has elapsed since last whole brain radiation treatment or at least two weeks has elapsed since last focal radiation treatment and the patient is deemed clinically stable by the investigator\n* Unstable or severe uncontrolled medical condition (e.g., unstable cardiac or pulmonary function or uncontrolled diabetes) or any important medical illness or abnormal laboratory finding that would, in the investigator's judgment, increase the risk to the patient associated with his or her participation in the study\n* Mean QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) >= 480 msec\n* Female subjects who are pregnant or breast-feeding\n* Hypersensitivity and/or history of allergy to the investigational product excipients",
