    "official_title": "A Phase 3, Multi-Center, Open-label Study to Test the Diagnostic Performance of Copper Cu 64 PSMA I&T PET/CT in Men With Biochemical Recurrence of Prostate Cancer",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Patients with histologically proven prostate adenocarcinoma.\n* Prior radical prostatectomy (greater than 6 weeks prior to screening) or radiation therapy (greater than 1 year prior to screening) with curative intent.\n* Recurrence of disease defined as:\n\n  1. Prior radical prostatectomy: PSA greater than or equal to 0.2 ng/mL followed by subsequent confirmatory PSA value greater than or equal to 0.2 ng/mL or\n  2. Prior radiation therapy: 2 ng/mL rise in PSA over post-treatment nadir.\n* Male aged greater than or equal to 18 years.\n* Able to understand and provide signed written informed consent.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be MALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) or other therapies targeting the androgen pathway within the past 3 months. Patients with a rising PSA level while on ADT for greater than 6 months are eligible.\n* Patients participating in an interventional clinical trial within 30 days and having received an Investigational Product (IP) within five (5) biological half-lives prior to administration.\n* Patients with any medical condition or circumstance (including receiving an IP or not capable of having a PET scan) that the investigator believes may compromise the data collected or lead to a failure to fulfill the study requirements.\n* Patients who are planned to have an x-ray contrast within 24 hours or other PET radiotracer within 10 physical half-lives prior to the PET scan. If Barium contrast is administered this should be cleared before the PET scan.\n* Patients who are administered any high-energy (greater than 300 keV) gamma-emitting radioisotopes within five (5) physical half-lives prior to copper Cu 64 PSMA I&T administration.\n* Patients with known hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the excipients of the IP.\n* Patients who had a PSMA PET scan as part of their standard medical care within 90 days prior to enrollment.",
