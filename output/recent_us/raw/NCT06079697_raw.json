    "official_title": "A Study of Enfortumab Vedotin (ASG-22CE) as Monotherapy or in Combination With Other Anticancer Therapies for the Treatment of Urothelial Cancer",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer (la/mUC) - Cohorts A, B, D, E, F, G and K.\n\n  * Histologically documented la/mUC, including squamous differentiation or mixed cell types.\n  * An Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status score of 0, 1 or 2: Participants with ECOG performance status of 2 must meet the following additional criteria: hemoglobin ≥10 g/dL, GFR ≥50 mL/min, may not have NYHA Class III heart failure.\n  * Eligible for pembrolizumab (Dose-escalation cohorts, Cohorts A, B, G and K Combination Arm).\n  * Dose-escalation cohorts: Ineligible for first-line cisplatin-based chemotherapy and no prior treatment for la/mUC, or have disease progression following at least 1 platinum-containing treatment.\n  * Cohort A: Ineligible for cisplatin-based chemotherapy and no prior treatment for la/mUC. No prior adjuvant/neoadjuvant platinum-based therapy in at least 12 months.\n  * Cohort B: Must have disease progression during/following treatment with at least 1 platinum-containing regimen for la/mUC or disease recurrence.\n  * Cohort D: Eligible for cisplatin-based chemotherapy and no prior treatment for la/mUC. No prior adjuvant/neoadjuvant platinum-based therapy in at least 12 months.\n  * Cohort E: Ineligible for cisplatin-based chemotherapy, eligible for carboplatin, and no prior treatment for la/mUC. No prior adjuvant/neoadjuvant platinum-based therapy in at least 12 months.\n  * Cohort F: Ineligible for platinum-based chemotherapy, or disease progression during/following at least 1 prior treatment for la/mUC. Eligible for gemcitabine.\n  * Cohort G: Eligible for platinum-based chemotherapy (either cisplatin or carboplatin) and no prior treatment for la/mUC. No prior adjuvant/neoadjuvant platinum-based therapy in at least 12 months.\n  * Cohort K: Ineligible for cisplatin-based chemotherapy due to at least 1 of the following: Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) <60 mL/min and ≥30 mL/min, ECOG performance status of 2, NCI CTCAE Version 4.03 Grade ≥2 hearing loss, New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III heart failure. No prior systemic treatment for locally advanced or metastatic disease. No adjuvant/neoadjuvant platinum-based therapy within 12 months prior to randomization.\n* Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer (MIBC)- Cohorts H, J and L.\n\n  * Histologically confirmed MIBC with predominant >50% urothelial histology: Cohorts H and J: Clinical stage cT2-T4aN0M0; Cohort L: Clinical stage cT2-T4aN0M0 or cT1-T4aN1M0: Participants with pT1 disease are eligible only if they have N1 disease on imaging. Mixed cell types are eligible if urothelial cancer is predominant (>50%); Participants with plasmacytoid and/or neuroendocrine tumors are ineligible regardless of component percentage. Urothelial tumors not originating in the bladder (eg, upper tract tumors, urethral tumors) are ineligible.\n  * Must be cisplatin-ineligible.\n  * Cohort-specific eligibility: Cohort J, H, and L: No prior systemic treatment, chemoradiation, or radiation therapy for MIBC. May have received prior intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) or intravesical chemotherapy for non-MIBC; Cohort J: Eligible for pembrolizumab.\n  * ECOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2.\n  * Anticipated life expectancy of ≥3 months.\n  * Tumor samples with an associated pathology report from the diagnostic transurethral resection of a bladder tumor done 90 days prior to the first dose of study treatment must be available prior to enrollment and determined to be sufficient for pathology review and biomarker analysis.\n  * Participants must be deemed eligible for RC+PLND.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* la/mUC - Cohorts A, B, D, E, F, G, and K\n\n  * Received any prior treatment with a PD-1 inhibitor, PD-L1 inhibitor, or PD-L2 inhibitor, except Cohort F.\n  * Received any prior treatment with stimulatory or co-inhibitory T-cell receptor agents, such as CD137 agonists, OX-40 agonists, or cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) inhibitors (except Cohort F).\n  * Ongoing sensory or motor neuropathy Grade 2 or higher.\n  * Active central nervous system (CNS) metastases.\n  * Ongoing clinically significant toxicity (Grade 2 or greater) associated with prior treatment (including radiotherapy or surgery).\n  * Conditions requiring high doses of steroids or other immunosuppressive medications.\n  * Prior treatment with enfortumab vedotin or other monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE)-based antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs).\n  * Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus.\n* MIBC - Cohorts H, J, and L\n\n  * Received prior systemic treatment, chemoradiation, and/or radiation therapy of muscle invasive bladder cancer.\n  * Received any prior treatment with a CPI.\n  * Received any prior treatment with stimulatory or co-inhibitory T-cell receptor agents, such as CD137 agonists, CTLA-4 inhibitors, or OX-40 agonists.\n  * For participants in Cohort H, evidence of nodal disease on imaging. For participants in Cohort L, ≥N2 nodal disease on imaging.\n  * Participant has undergone partial cystectomy of the bladder to remove any NMIBC or MIBC.\n  * Ongoing sensory or motor neuropathy Grade 2 or higher.\n  * Conditions requiring high doses of steroids or other immunosuppressive medications.\n  * Prior treatment with enfortumab vedotin or other MMAE-based ADCs for urothelial cancer.\n  * Participants with a history of another invasive malignancy within 3 years before first dose of study drug.",
