    "inclusion_criteria": "* Subjects must have histologically confirmed malignancy that is metastatic or unresectable and for which standard curative measures do not exist or are no longer effective\n* Subjects will be eligible for this study based on the presence of actionable aberrations in one or more of the following DNA damage response (DDR) genes: ARID1A, ATM, ATR, ATRX, BAP1, BARD1, BRCA1/2, BRIP1, CDK12, CHEK2, FANCA, FANCC, FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, FANCM, MRE11A, MSH2, NBN (NBS1), PALB2, RAD51, RAD51C, RAD51D, SMARCB1, and VHL, or other related genes at the discretion of the principal investigator in consultation with the MD Anderson Cancer Center Institute for Personalized Cancer Therapy Precision Oncology Decision Support (PODS) group. Variant interpretation for actionability will be performed by PODS\n* Subjects with germline defects in DDR genes are eligible for this trial\n* The collection of archival tumor tissue (within 1 year prior to study enrollment) will be mandatory. Tumor biopsies on cycle 1 day 15 will be mandatory. Subjects will not be put at undue risk to obtain the biopsy at cycle 1 day 15 (C1D15). A biopsy at C1D15 will not be required if it poses a serious/severe complication risk greater than 2%. All other biopsy time points are not mandatory but will be strongly encouraged where feasible. These include at baseline and at disease progression. Archival and fresh tissue requests can be waived in exceptional circumstances with principal investigator (PI) approval and only where rationale is documented\n* Subjects must have received at least 1 line of systemic therapy in the advanced/metastatic setting. Subjects with diseases without known effective options, and subjects who had declined standard of care therapy prior to study introduction are also eligible\n* Subjects enrolling in the dose escalation should have progressed on or be intolerant to all therapies known to confer a clinical benefit. Subjects must not have refused all available therapies\n* Subjects who have received prior therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are eligible for this trial.

Patients must agree to utilize 2 reliable and acceptable methods of contraception simultaneously. A man is considered fertile after puberty unless permanently sterile by bilateral orchiectomy. Men taking part in this study are advised not to father a child during and up to 6 months after treatment; prior to treatment, advice should be sought for conserving sperm due to the chance of irreversible infertility as a consequence of treatment. Female partners of childbearing potential from male study patients have to use adequate contraception / birth control between signing of the informed consent and 6 months after the last administration of the study drug if the male study patient is not sterilized. The investigator or a designated associate is requested to advise the patient how to achieve highly effective birth control. Highly effective (failure rate of less than 1% per year) contraception methods, when used consistently and correctly, include:\n\n  * Combined (estrogen and progestin containing: oral, intravaginal, transdermal) and progestin-only (oral, injectable, implantable) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation\n  * Intra-uterine device or intrauterine hormone-releasing system\n  * Bilateral tubal occlusion or vasectomized partner (provided that partner is the sole sexual partner and has received medical assessment of the surgical success)\n  * Sexual abstinence (reliability to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient) Male patients with a female partner of reproductive potential must use a condom and ensure that an additional form of contraception is also used during treatment and until 6 months after last study drug administration. Patients must agree to utilize 2 reliable and acceptable methods of contraception simultaneously\n* Evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent document indicating that the patient has been informed of all pertinent aspects of the study\n* Willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan, laboratory tests, and other procedures\n* Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected (HIV1/2 antibody-positive) patients may participate IF they meet all the following eligibility requirements:\n\n  * They must be on an anti-retroviral regimen with evidence of at least two undetectable viral loads within the past 6 months on this same regimen; the most recent undetectable viral load must be within the past 12 weeks\n  * They must have a CD4 count >= 250 cells/mcL over the past 6 months on this same anti-retroviral regimen and must not have had a CD4 count < 200 cells/ mcL over the past 2 years, unless it was deemed related to the cancer and/or chemotherapy-induced bone marrow suppression\n\n    * For patients who have received chemotherapy in the past 6 months, a CD4 count < 250 cells/mcL during chemotherapy is permitted as long as viral loads were undetectable during this same chemotherapy\n  * They must have an undetectable viral load and a CD4 count >= 250 cells/mcL within 7 days of enrolment\n  * They must not be currently receiving prophylactic therapy for an opportunistic infection and must not have had an opportunistic infection within the past 6 months\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
