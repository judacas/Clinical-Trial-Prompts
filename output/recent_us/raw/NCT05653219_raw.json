Patients must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n* Women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) must agree to have a pregnancy test within 14 days prior to registration and a repeated test within 3 days of the first dose of ficlatuzumab.\n* Patients must agree to use highly effective contraceptive measures while on study and for 60 days after the last dose of study drug. This includes: Men of reproductive potential AND women of childbearing potential.\n* Effective birth control includes (a) intrauterine device (IUD) plus one barrier method; or (b) 2 barrier methods. Effective barrier methods are male or female condoms, diaphragms, and spermicides (creams or gels that contain a chemical to kill sperm).\n\nExclusion Criteria\n\n* Nasopharyngeal primary site if WHO Type III (non-keratinizing and EBV-positive as established at the local site).\n* History of severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions or hypersensitivity to recombinant proteins or excipients in the investigational agent.\n* Prior treatment with an HGF/cMet inhibitor such as rilotumumab, crizotinib, MetMAb, or tivantinib (ARQ197).\n* Uncontrolled central nervous system (CNS) metastases, including leptomeningeal metastases, are not allowed.\n\nNote: Subjects with previously treated brain metastases will be allowed if the brain metastases have been stable without steroid treatment for at least 2 weeks (radiotherapy or surgery).\n\n* Failure to recover to Grade 1 or baseline from all toxic effects of previous chemotherapy, radiation therapy, biologic therapy, immunotherapy, and/or experimental therapy, with the exception of:\n* Alopecia,\n* Grade ≤ 2 peripheral neuropathy,\n* Grade ≤ 2 cetuximab-related rash or other skin changes,\n* Hypomagnesemia (acceptable values detailed in the exclusion criteria below),\n* Hypokalemia (acceptable values detailed in the exclusion criteria below), and\n* The acceptable ANC and PLT inclusion criteria values above.\n* Treatment with cetuximab 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug. A washout period of 2 weeks from prior cetuximab is required if applicable.\n* Treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy or investigational drug 3 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug.
