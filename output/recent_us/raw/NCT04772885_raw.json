    "inclusion_criteria": "* Histologically confirmed, clinical localized adenocarcinoma of the prostate\n* No evidence of disease beyond the prostate and/or seminal vesicles (i.e., no suspicious pelvic lymph nodes or presence of metastatic disease outside the pelvis)\n* Staging workup as recommended by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) on the basis of risk grouping:\n\n  * Low risk: No staging workup required\n  * Favorable intermediate-risk: computed tomography (CT) abdomen/pelvis only if Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) nomogram predicts > 10% probability of lymph node involvement (note: CT simulation scan will count as a CT abdomen/pelvis)\n  * Unfavorable intermediate-risk: technetium bone scan, CT abdomen/pelvis if MSKCC nomogram predicts > 10% probability of lymph node involvement (note: CT simulation scan will count as a CT abdomen/pelvis)\n  * High-risk: technetium bone scan, CT abdomen/pelvis if MSKCC nomogram predicts > 10% probability of lymph node involvement (note: CT simulation scan will count as a CT abdomen/pelvis) =\n  * Advanced imaging studies (i.e. prostate specific membrane antigen [PSMA] positron emission tomography [PET] and Axumin scan) can supplant a bone scan if performed first\n* Ability to understand, and willingness to sign, the written informed consent\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be MALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Patients with neuroendocrine or small cell carcinoma of the prostate\n* Patients with any evidence of distant metastases. Note, evidence of lymphadenopathy below the level of the renal arteries can be deemed loco regional per the discretion of the investigator\n* Prior whole-gland cryosurgery, high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) or brachytherapy of the prostate\n* Prior pelvic radiotherapy\n* History of Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, or ataxia telangiectasia",
