    "official_title": "A Phase 2/3, Randomized, Double-Blind, Controlled Study of Zanzalintinib (XL092) in Combination With Pembrolizumab vs Pembrolizumab in First-Line Treatment of Subjects With PD-L1 Positive Recurrent or Metastatic Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Histologically or cytologically-confirmed R/M HNSCC that is considered incurable by local therapy.\n\n  * Subjects should not have had prior systemic therapy administered in the recurrent or metastatic setting. Systemic therapy which was completed more than 6 months prior to randomization if given as part of multimodal treatment for locally advanced disease is allowed.\n  * The eligible primary tumor locations are the oropharynx, oral cavity, hypopharynx, and larynx.\n* PD-L1 expression level Combined Positive Score (CPS) ≥ 1.\n* Subjects with oropharyngeal cancer must have HPV status from tumor tissue.\n* Measurable disease according to RECIST 1.1 as determined by the Investigator.\n* Tumor samples (archival or fresh tumor biopsy) are required. If archival tissue is unavailable, must provide fresh tumor tissue biopsy prior to randomization.\n* Recovery to baseline or ≤ Grade 1 severity (CTCAE v5) from adverse events (AEs) related to any prior treatments, unless AE(s) are clinically nonsignificant and/or stable on supportive therapy.\n* Age 18 years (or the legal age of consent in your country, if higher than 18) or older on the day of consent.\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1.\n* Adequate organ and marrow function.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Nasopharynx, salivary gland or occult primary site (regardless of p16 status).\n* Has disease that is suitable for local therapy administered with curative intent.\n* Has received prior therapy with zanzalintinib, any anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent or with an agent directed to another stimulatory or co-inhibitory T-cell receptor (eg, CTLA-4, OX-40, CD137).\n* Life expectancy < 3 months.\n* Had progressive disease within 6 months of completion of curatively intended systemic treatment for locoregionally advanced HNSCC.\n* Radiation therapy for bone metastases within 2 weeks, any other radiation therapy within 4 weeks prior to randomization.\n* Known brain metastases or cranial epidural disease unless adequately treated with radiotherapy and/or surgery (including radiosurgery) and stable for at least 4 weeks prior to randomization.\n* Positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) test.\n* Positive hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody test.\n* Major surgery (eg, GI surgery, removal or biopsy of brain metastasis) within 8 weeks prior to randomization. Complete wound healing from major or minor surgery must have occurred at least prior to randomization.\n* Corrected QT interval calculated by the Fridericia formula (QTcF) > 480 ms per electrocardiogram (ECG) within 28 days before randomization.\n* Pregnant or lactating females.\n* Administration of a live, attenuated vaccine within 30 days before randomization.",
