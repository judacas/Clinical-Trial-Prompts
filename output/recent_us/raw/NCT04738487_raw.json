However, participants must not receive polatuzumab vedotin, and/or mosunetuzumab as part of bridging therapy.\n\n  * Bridging therapy is defined as lymphoma directed therapy administered between leukapheresis and the start of LD chemotherapy. This includes cytotoxic chemotherapy (e.g.: bendamustine and rituximab [BR], rituximab, gemcitabine and oxaliplatin [R-gem/ox]), radiation, corticosteroids, as well as novel therapies such as BTK inhibitors (e.g.: Ibrutinib), immunomodulators (e.g.: lenalidomide), monoclonal antibodies (e.g.: rituximab, obinutuzumab, tafasitamab) antibody drug conjugates (e.g: loncastuximab), checkpoint inhibitors (e.g.: pembrolizumab, nivolumab), clinical trial treatments, etc.\n  * If a participant receives polatuzumab vedotin or mosunetuzumab as bridging they will ineligible to continue on step 1 registration portion of the study and be ineligible for step 2 randomization\n* STEP 1: REGISTRATION: PET-CT scan must be planned for completion within 60 days prior to the start of LD chemotherapy.\n\n  * All pre-CAR T-cell therapy disease must be assessed and documented on the baseline/pre-registration tumor assessment form.\n  * If receiving bridging therapy, participants must have a PET-CT scan upon completion of all planned bridging therapy. If the PET-CT scan after completion of bridging therapy is consistent with complete remission per Lugano criteria as determined by enrolling physician, that participant will be ineligible for step 2 randomization.\n  * Participants are permitted to receive corticosteroids after leukapheresis without the need to repeat a PET-CT scan. If steroids are used, they must be planned to stop no later than 3 days before CAR -T cell infusion.\n  * If response assessment by central review cannot be completed (I.e., poor quality of PET-CT scan, PET-CT performed out of window, etc.) this would be recorded as 'inadequate assessment' and patient would not be eligible for randomization\n* STEP 1: REGISTRATION: Participants that have previously been treated with polatuzumab vedotin or mosunetuzumab prior to CAR T-cell leukapheresis for either indolent or aggressive NHL are eligible as long as the participant did not have refractory disease or progression/relapse within 6 months of the last infusion with either agent\n* STEP 1: REGISTRATION: Participants must be planning to receive CAR T-cell infusion no earlier than 2 days and no later than 14 days after completion of the last day of lymphodepleting chemotherapy.
