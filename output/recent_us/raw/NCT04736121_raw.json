    "inclusion_criteria": "* Diagnosis -- Stratum 1: Recurrent or refractory primary malignant CNS tumor patients Patients with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of a primary malignant non-brainstem CNS tumor (excluding DIPG patients) that is recurrent, progressive, or refractory. All tumors must have histologic verification at either the time of diagnosis or recurrence except patients with marker (+) CNS germ cell tumors.\n\nStratum 2: Newly diagnosed DIPG patients (on-hold until pediatric RP2D has been established in Stratum 1) Patients with diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPGs) will be eligible 6 to 14 weeks post-completion of radiation therapy if they do not have any evidence of progression. Patients with newly diagnosed DIPGs, defined as tumors with a pontine epicenter and diffuse involvement of 2/3 or more of the pons, are eligible without histologic confirmation. Patients with pontine tumors that do not meet these criteria or not considered to be typical intrinsic pontine gliomas will only be eligible if the tumors have been biopsied and (1) are proven to be an anaplastic astrocytoma, glioblastoma multiforme, gliosarcoma, anaplastic mixed glioma or fibrillary astrocytoma or (2) have a histone mutation typically seen in DIPG.

Patients who are unable to walk because of neurologic deficits, but who are up in a wheelchair, will be considered ambulatory for the purpose of assessing the performance score.\n\n• Organ Function --\n\nPatients must have adequate organ and bone marrow function as defined below:\n\nAbsolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) ≥ 1.0 x 109 cells/ L Platelets ≥ 100 x 109 cells/L (unsupported, defined as no platelet transfusion within 7 days) Hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL (may receive transfusions) Total bilirubin ≤1.5 times institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤ 3 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) Albumin ≥ 3 g/dl Serum creatinine based on age/gender as noted below. Patients that do not meet the criteria below but have a 24 hour Creatinine Clearance or GFR (radioisotope or iothalamate) ≥ 70 mL/min/1.73 m2 are eligible.\n\nAge Maximum Serum Creatinine (mg/dL) 1 to < 2 years 0.6, 0.6 (M, F); 2 to < 6 years 0.8, 0.8 (M, F); 6 to < 10 years 1, 1 (M, F); 10 to < 13 years 1.2, 1.2 (M, F); 13 to < 16 years 1.5, 1.4 (M, F); ≥ 16 years 1.7, 1.4 (M, F).\n\n• Cardiac Function: Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) > 50% ECG QTc ≤ 450 msec\n\n• Pulmonary Function: Oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry is > 93% on room air and no evidence of dyspnea at rest\n\n• Growth Factors -- Patients must be off all colony- forming growth factor(s) for at least 1 week prior to enrollment (i.e., filgrastim, sargramostim or erythropoietin). 2 weeks must have elapsed if patients received PEG formulations.\n\n* Pregnancy Status -- Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test.\n* Pregnancy Prevention -- Female subjects with childbearing potential and male subjects should use effective contraception methods (or abstain from sexual activity) while being treated with APX005M and for 30 days following treatment.\n* Informed Consent -- The patient or parent/guardian is able to understand the consent and is willing to sign a written informed consent document according to institutional guidelines.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 1 Year\nMust have maximum age of 21 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "• Concurrent Illness -- Patients with any clinically significant unrelated systemic illness (serious infections Grade ≥ 2 or significant cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic or other organ dysfunction), that in the opinion of the investigator would compromise the patient's ability to tolerate protocol therapy, put them at additional risk for toxicity or would interfere with the study procedures or results.\n\nPatients with a history of any other malignancy, except patients with a secondary brain tumor if the patient's first malignancy has been in remission for at least 5 years from the end of treatment.\n\n• Concurrent Therapy -- Patients who are receiving any other anticancer or investigational drug therapy.\n\nPatients requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (greater than physiologic replacement, defined as dexamethasone 0.75 mg/m2/day) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study drug administration will be excluded. However, patients who require intermittent use of bronchodilators or local steroid injections will not be excluded from the study. Please see section 5.3 for a list of acceptable and unacceptable concomitant medications as well as reporting requirements.\n\n• Presence of Bulky Tumor --\n\nPatients with bulky tumor on imaging are ineligible. Bulky tumor is defined as:\n\nTumor with any evidence of uncal herniation or midline shift Tumor that in the opinion of the site investigator, shows significant mass effect\n\n* Allergy -- Patients with a history of severe (Grade ≥ 3) hypersensitivity reaction to a monoclonal antibody are ineligible.\n* Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation -- Patients who have received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation are ineligible.\n* Autoimmune Diseases -- Patients with active autoimmune disease or documented history of autoimmune disease/syndrome that requires ongoing systemic steroids or systemic immunosuppressive agents, except Patients with vitiligo or well controlled asthma/atopy Patients with hypothyroidism stable on hormone replacement or Sjogren's syndrome\n* Inability to Participate -- Patients who in the opinion of the investigator are unwilling or unable to return for required follow-up visits or obtain follow-up studies required to assess toxicity to therapy or to adhere to drug administration plan, other study procedures, and study restrictions.\n* Bleeding Disorder -- Patients with a known coagulopathy or bleeding diathesis or require the use of systemic anticoagulant medication are not eligible.\n* Pregnancy Status -- Female patients must not be pregnant or breast-feeding.",
