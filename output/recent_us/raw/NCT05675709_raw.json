Contact with positive case, residence, or travel to an area with high incidence) that may increase the risk of study participation or, in the investigator's judgment, make the participant inappropriate for the study.\n4. Participants with an eGFR of ≤ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 based on the 2021 CKD-EPI equation, with a single repeat permitted to assess eligibility, if needed.\n5. Concurrent use of any of the following prohibited concomitant medication(s) within 12 days prior to the first dose of lorlatinib:\n\n   1. Known strong CYP3A inhibitors (eg, boceprevir, cobicistat, clarithromycin, conivaptan, diltiazem, idelalisib, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, lopinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, posaconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, tipranavir, troleandomycin, voriconazole, grapefruit juice or grapefruit/grapefruit-related citrus fruits [eg Seville oranges, pomelos]). The topical use of these medications (if applicable), such as 2% ketoconazole cream, is allowed.\n   2. Known strong CYP3A inducers (eg, carbamazepine, enzalutamide, mitotane, phenytoin, rifabutin, rifampin, St. John's Wort).\n   3. Known P-gp substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (eg, digoxin).\n6. Concurrent use of CYP3A substrates with narrow therapeutic indices (eg, alfentanil, cyclosporine, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, fentanyl including transdermal patch, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus) within 12 days prior to the first dose of lorlatinib.\n7.

Known hypersensitivity to lorlatinib or its excipients.\n9. A positive urine drug test. Participants with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Cohorts 1 and 2) will be eligible to participate if their urine drug test is positive with a drug for a prescribed condition that is not expected to interfere with the PK of lorlatinib.\n10.

Screening supine BP ≥140 mm Hg (systolic) or ≥90 mm Hg (diastolic), following at least 5 minutes of supine rest. If initial supine BP is ≥140 mm Hg (systolic) or ≥90 mm Hg (diastolic), the BP should be repeated 2 more times and the average of the 3 BP values should be used to determine the participant's eligibility.\n4. Baseline standard 12-lead ECG that demonstrates clinically relevant abnormalities that may affect participant safety or interpretation of study results (eg, baseline QTcF interval >450 msec, complete LBBB, signs of an acute or indeterminate age myocardial infarction, ST T interval changes suggestive of myocardial ischemia, second or third degree AV block, baseline PR interval >200, or serious bradyarrhythmias or tachyarrhythmias). If the baseline uncorrected QT interval is >450 msec, this interval should be rate corrected using the Fridericia method and the resulting QTcF should be used for decision making and reporting. If QTcF exceeds 450 msec, or QRS exceeds 120 msec, the ECG should be repeated 2 more times and the average of the 3 QTcF or QRS values should be used to determine the participant's eligibility. Computer interpreted ECGs should be overread by a physician experienced in reading ECGs before excluding a participant.\n5. Use of prescription or nonprescription drugs and dietary supplements within 7 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study medication. As an exception, acetaminophen/paracetamol may be used at doses of ≤1 g/day.

Severe uncontrolled ascites and/or pleural effusion.\n8. Screening supine BP ≥160 mm Hg (systolic) or ≥90 mm Hg (diastolic), on a single measurement following at least 5 minutes of rest. If initial supine BP is ≥160 mm Hg (systolic) or ≥90 mm Hg (diastolic), the BP should be repeated 2 more times and the average of the three BP values should be used to determine the participant's eligibility.\n9. Screening supine 12-lead ECG demonstrating QTcF >470 msec. If initial QTcF exceeds 470 msec, the ECG should be repeated two more times and the average of the three QTcF values should be used to determine the participant's eligibility.\n10.
