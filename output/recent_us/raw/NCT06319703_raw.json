At least 5 half-lives much have elapsed since prior IDH-inhibitor use. In general, at least 4 weeks must have elapsed from any other anticancer drug therapy (e.g. bevacizumab).\n9. Patients must be able to undergo contrast-enhanced MRI scans.\n10. Patients must have shown unequivocal evidence for tumor progression by MRI in comparison to a prior scan\n11. At least 12 weeks elapsed since prior radiotherapy\n12. Life expectancy greater than 12 weeks\n13.

Male participants must agree to use a contraception as detailed in Appendix 3 of this protocol during the treatment period and for at least 120 days following the last dose of study treatment and refrain from donation sperm during this period.\n15. A female participant is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant, not breastfeeding, and at least one of the following conditions applies:\n\n    i. Not a WOCBP or ii. A WOCBP who agrees to follow the contraceptive guidance during the treatment period for at least 120 days after the last dose of study treatment. Note: Cases of pregnancy that occur during maternal exposures to treatment should be reported. If a patient is determined to be pregnant following treatment initiation, treatment must be discontinued immediately.\n16. Women must agree not to breast feed while on therapy and for at least 120 days following the last dose of study drug.\n\n    * Hematological Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1500/μL Platelets ≥100 000/μL Hemoglobin ≥9.0 g/dL or ≥5.6 mmol/L\n    * Renal Creatinine OR Measured or calculated creatinine clearance (GFR can also be used in place of creatinine or CrCl) ≤1.5 × ULN OR ≥30 mL/min for participant with creatinine levels <1.5 × institutional ULN\n    * Hepatic Total bilirubin ≤1.5 ×ULN OR direct bilirubin ≤ULN for participants with total bilirubin levels >1.5 × ULN AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) ≤2.5 × ULN (≤5 × ULN for participants with liver metastases)\n    * Coagulation International normalized ratio (INR) OR prothrombin time (PT) Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) ≤1.5 × ULN unless participant is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or aPTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. No limit on number of prior therapies\n2. Evidence of significant intracranial hemorrhage\n3. No other investigational or standard anti-tumor therapy allowed\n4. Patients must not have a known history of allergic reaction attributed to study drugs or compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition unless allergic reaction was managed by pre-medication.\n5. Patients must not have a serious pre-existing medical condition or uncontrolled intercurrent illness that would preclude participation in this study (for example, uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia, interstitial lung disease, severe dyspnea at rest of requiring oxygen therapy, history of major surgical resection involving the stomach or bowel, or pre-existing Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis or other autoimmune disease,) or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements\n6. Patients must not have a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or be receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy (in dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug.\n7. Patients must not have an active systemic fungal and/or known viral infection (for example human immunodeficiency virus antibodies, hepatitis B surface antigen, or hepatitis C antibodies).\n8. Patients must not have a history of active tuberculosis.\n9. Patients must not have an active infection requiring systemic therapy\n10. Patients must not have known history of, or any evidence of active, non-infectious pneumonitis\n11.

Patients must not have active autoimmune disease that required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g. thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc) is not considered a form of systemic treatment.\n16. Patients must not have received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study (Note: Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines are live attenuated vaccine and are not allowed)\n17. Concurrent treatment on another clinical trial. Supportive care trials or nontherapeutic trials (i.e. quality of life) are allowed.",
