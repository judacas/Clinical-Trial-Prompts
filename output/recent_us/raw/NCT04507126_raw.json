    "inclusion_criteria": "* Adults (â‰¥ 18 years)\n* Diagnosed with a solid tumor cancer type that has established guidelines suggesting the utility of genetic testing in treatment (breast, ovarian, prostate, pancreatic, colon, Lynch syndrome-related cancers (colorectal, endometrial, gastric, ovarian, pancreatic, urothelial, brain (usually glioblastoma), biliary tract, small intestine), Li-Fraumeni syndrome tumor spectrum (e.g., soft tissue sarcoma, osteosarcoma, central nervous system tumors, breast cancer, adrenocortical carcinoma), etc.)\n* Eligible for GCT based on the current NCCN guidelines\n* Starting new systemic therapy or switching systemic therapy\n* Eligible for GCT as per the current NCCN guidelines\n* No prior genetic testing (or tested before 2014)\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Prior GCT with test results available (if tested 2014 onwards)\n* Patients scheduled for treatment education with Advanced Practice Provider (typically reserved for more complex regimens)\n* Patients with cognitive impairments or severe psychological disorders that would limit their ability to understand the genetic counseling/testing information or give informed consent.\n* Any other condition that would, in the investigator's judgment, contraindicate the patient's participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns with clinical study procedures (e.g., patients requiring urgent therapy and/or inpatient chemotherapy initiation).\n* Patients who are currently participating in other clinical trials that could confound the outcomes of genetic testing uptake.\n* Prospective participants who, in the investigator's opinion, may not be able to comply with all study procedures (including compliance issues related to logistics).\n* Hematologic malignancy",
