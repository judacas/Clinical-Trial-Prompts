    "exclusion_criteria": "* Patients who have had chemotherapy (including investigational cytotoxic chemotherapy), biologic agents (e.g. targeted therapy or antibodies) or radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment\n* Patients who have not recovered from adverse events attributed to prior anti-cancer therapy (i.e. have residual toxicities > grade 1, except for alopecia, neuropathy, lymphocytopenia and other non-clinically significant adverse events)\n* Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents\n* Patients should be excluded if they have had prior treatment with anti-CTLA-4 antibody or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation; previous treatment with anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1 or anti-PD-L2 is allowed and patients will be enrolled in the exploratory cohort (arm C) at the time of progression from last line of treatment (treatment with immune check point inhibitor does not have to necessary be the last line of treatment)\n* Patients should be excluded if they have had prior treatment with cabozantinib;

patients with vitiligo or diabetes are not excluded; replacement therapy (e.g. thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment; patients with recent history of thyroiditis; subjects with remote history (greater than 5 years) of thyroiditis are not excluded\n* Psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements\n* The subject has a corrected QT interval calculated by the Fridericia formula (QTcF) > 500 ms within 28 days before randomization; Note: if initial QTcF is found to be > 500 ms, two additional electrocardiogram (EKG)s separated by at least 3 minutes should be performed; if the average of these three consecutive results for QTcF is =< 500 ms, the subject meets eligibility in this regard\n* Patient is not able to swallow pills\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because XL184 and nivolumab are agents with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with XL184 and nivolumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with XL184 and nivolumab",
