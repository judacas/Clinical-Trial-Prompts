    "official_title": "Immune Activation and Cellular Response From Enzalutamide Alone or With Radium223 in Men With Metastatic, Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Men with metastatic, castration resistant prostate cancer involving the bone, which is symptomatic or asymptomatic\n* Castration resistance will be defined as the development of disease progression, defined as one of the following:\n\n  * Rising PSA x 2 values >= 2 weeks apart; minimum absolute PSA value 2 ng/mL\n  * Radiographic progression, with at least 1 new site of metastasis\n  * Symptomatic progression (ex: increase in pain despite stable imaging) AND despite ongoing luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) therapy OR testosterone level < 50\n* Men must have osseous metastases, but the presence of visceral metastases will not exclude patients from participation\n\n  * Prior external beam radiation therapy (> 4 weeks prior to enrollment) for palliation of osseous metastatic disease is allowed, provided there is at least one osseous metastasis which has not been irradiated and which can be biopsied\n* No prior docetaxel or cabazitaxel chemotherapy for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) (men treated with prior docetaxel administered as up-front therapy with androgen deprivation therapy [ADT] > 6 months ago will be eligible); prior abiraterone is allowed\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1\n* Hemoglobin >= 9.5 g/dL\n* Absolute neutrophil count >= 1,500\n* Platelets >= 100,000\n* Total bilirubin within normal institutional limits\n* Creatinine clearance (calculated or measured) > 30 mL/min\n* At least one risk factor predicting higher likelihood of bone marrow sample yield: elevated alkaline phosphatase, low hemoglobin, or elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be MALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Prior treatment with docetaxel or cabazitaxel for mCRPC\n* Prior treatment with ARN-509 or enzalutamide (there is a grace period for men who wish to enroll and who have recently started enzalutamide for the first time but have taken less than 15 days of therapy)\n\n  * Concurrent use of androgen deprivation therapy aside from LHRH agonist or antagonist (i.e. bicalutamide, flutamide, nilutamide, abiraterone, ketoconazole, estrogen); there will be a 2 week wash-out period from the last dose of any of these agents until the first dose of enzalutamide on study; patients who have just started enzalutamide for fewer than 5 doses prior to enrollment in the trial are still considered eligible and not subject to wash-out\n* Concurrent oral corticosteroid use aside from adrenal replacement, or use of other immunosuppressive agents (ex: infliximab); topical or inhaled steroids will be allowed\n* Received systemic therapy with radionuclides (e.g., strontium-89, samarium- 153, rhenium-186, or rhenium-188, or radium Ra 223 dichloride) for the treatment of bony metastases\n* History of seizures except for remote with specific etiology which has resolved (ex: alcohol induced seizure); transient ischemic attack (TIA) or cerebrovascular accident (CVA) within last 6 months\n* Known untreated central nervous system (CNS) metastases; leptomeningeal disease will be an absolute exclusion criterion due to limited life expectancy\n* Chronic diarrhea > grade 1, or a diagnosis of Crohn?s or ulcerative colitis\n* Known hepatitis (hep) B or C, or known cirrhosis (screening for viral hepatitis is not required)\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness such as infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, or psychiatric illness which would limit compliance with study requirements\n* Imminent spinal cord compression based on clinical findings and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); treatment should be completed for spinal cord compression",
