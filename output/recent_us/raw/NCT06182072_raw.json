    "inclusion_criteria": "Phase 1a:\n\n1. Patients must have histologically or cytologically documented metastatic/advanced epithelial cancer that has relapsed from or is refractory to standard treatment, or for which no standard treatment is available.\n2. At least one measurable site of disease according to RECIST Version 1.1 criteria; this lesion must be either (i) outside a previously irradiated area or (ii) progressive if it is in a previously irradiated area\n3. Tumour accessible for biopsy, biopsy deemed safe by the Investigator, and patient willing to consent to tumour biopsies\n\nAll patients:\n\n1. Provide written informed consent to participate\n2. Ability to comply with study procedures in the Investigator's opinion\n3. Aged 18 years or over\n4. ECOG performance status 0 or 1\n5. Predicted life expectancy of ≥6 months\n6. Adequate lung reserve\n7. Adequate renal function\n8. Adequate hepatic function\n9. Adequate bone marrow function\n10. Meeting reproductive status requirements\n\nExclusion Criteria\n\n1. Prior or planned allogeneic or autologous bone marrow or organ transplantation\n2. Splenectomy\n3. Active infections requiring antibiotics, physician monitoring or systemic therapy within 1 week of the anticipated first dose of study drug, or recurrent fevers (>38.0˚C) associated with a clinical diagnosis of active infection\n4. Treatment with the antiviral agents: ribavirin, adefovir, lamivudine, cidofovir or paxlovid within 10 days prior to the first dose of study treatment; or pegylated interferon in the 4 weeks before the first dose of study treatment\n5. Known history of hepatitis B infection or known active hepatitis C infection . Known history of HIV infection\n6. Patients who have active, known or suspected autoimmune disease that has required systemic therapy in the past 2 years, are immunocompromised in the opinion of the Investigator, or are receiving long-term systemic immunosuppressive treatment\n7. Treatment with any live, live-attenuated or COVID-19 vaccine in the 30 days before the first dose of NG-641 or nivolumab\n8. Treatment with any other vaccine (including known non-live/live-attenuated and non-adenoviral COVID-19 vaccines) in the 7 days before the first dose of NG-641\n9. History of prior Grade 3-4 acute kidney injury or other clinically significant renal impairment\n10. History of clinically significant interstitial lung disease or non-infectious pneumonitis\n11. Lymphangitic carcinomatosis\n12. Infectious or inflammatory bowel disease in the 3 months before the first dose of study treatment\n13. Any known CTCAE Grade ≥2 coagulation abnormality/coagulopathy\n14. Any clinically significant cardiovascular, peripheral vascular, cerebrovascular, or thromboembolic event in the 6 months before the first dose of study treatment\n15. Grade 3 or 4 gastrointestinal bleeding (or risk factors for gastrointestinal bleeding), haemoptysis, or any history of bleeding requiring an investigative procedure, transfusion or hospitalisation in the 6 months before the first dose of study treatment\n16. Tumour location/extent considered by the Investigator to present a significant risk if tumour flare or necrosis were to occur\n17. Known retinopathy, including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, papilloedema, optic neuropathy and retinal artery or vein obstruction\n18. Active clinically severe depression\n19. Use of the following prior therapies/treatments\n\n    * Treatment with any other enadenotucirev-based virus (parent virus or transgene-modified variants), or fibroblast activation protein (FAP) targeting agent at any time\n    * Treatment with an investigational or licensed anti-cancer monoclonal antibody (mAb), immune checkpoint inhibitor, immune stimulatory treatment, or other biological therapy in the 28 days prior to the first dose of study treatment\n    * Prior anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy is permitted without a 'washout' phase\n    * Treatment with an investigational or licensed chemotherapy, targeted small molecule, or other investigational drug in the 14 days or five half-lives (whichever is shorter) before the first dose of study treatment\n    * Major surgery in the 28 days before the first dose of study treatment\n    * Radiation therapy in the 14 days before the first dose of study treatment\n    * Treatment with complementary medications to treat the disease under study within the 14 days prior to first study treatment\n    * Bisphosphonate therapy or treatment with Receptor Activator of Nuclear factor Kappa-Β (RANK)-ligand inhibitors for metastatic bone disease is permitted\n20. All toxicities attributed to prior anti-cancer therapy (including radiation therapy) must have resolved to Grade 1 or baseline before the first dose of study treatment (see protocol for exceptions)\n21. Known allergy or hypersensitivity (Grade ≥3) to NG-641 transgene, immune checkpoint inhibitor products or formulation, or other monoclonal antibodies\n22. Known hypersensitivity to both cidofovir and valacyclovir\n23. Discontinuation from prior treatment with an immune therapy due to a Grade ≥3 immune-related AE, or any history of life-threatening toxicity related to prior immune therapy except those that are unlikely to re-occur with standard countermeasures\n24. Other prior malignancy active within the previous 3 year (see protocol for exceptions)\n25. Symptomatic brain metastases or any leptomeningeal metastases that are symptomatic and/or requires treatment (see protocol for exceptions)\n26. Any serious or uncontrolled medical disorder that, in the opinion of the Investigator or the Medical Monitor, may increase the risk associated with study participation or study treatment administration, impair the ability of the patient to receive protocol therapy or interfere with the interpretation of study results\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
