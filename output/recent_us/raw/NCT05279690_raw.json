    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Previous treatment in this trial.\n2.

Participants with treated, stable brain metastases are eligible provided they meet the following criteria:\n\n   * Radiotherapy or major surgery for brain metastases was completed at least 2 weeks (for radiotherapy) or 4 weeks (for major brain metastases surgery) prior to the first administration of BI 764532.\n   * Patient is off steroids for at least 7 days (physiologic doses of steroids are permitted), and the patient is off anti-epileptic drugs for at least 7 days or on stable doses of anti-epileptic drugs for malignant central nervous system (CNS) disease.\n4. Presence of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis.\n5. Prior participation in clinical trials of BI 764532, including receiving standard of care in these trials OR prior treatment with T cell engager (TcE) or cell therapies targeting delta-like ligand 3 (DLL3).\n6.

Major surgery (major according to the investigator's assessment) within 28 days prior to first administration of BI 764532 or planned during treatment period, e.g. hip replacement.\n8. Previous or concomitant malignancies other than the one treated in this trial within the last 2 years except\n\n   1. effectively treated non-melanoma skin cancers\n   2. effectively treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix\n   3. effectively treated ductal carcinoma in situ\n   4. other effectively treated malignancy that is considered cured by local treatment Further exclusion criteria apply.",
