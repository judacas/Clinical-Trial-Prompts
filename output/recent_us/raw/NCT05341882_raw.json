Evaluation by a Stanford medical oncologist must show:\n\n   1. The patient is expected to continue on immunotherapy for at least three more months\n   2. Imaging must show response, stable disease, or modest progression\n   3. If there is modest progression, the patient must be clinically stable in terms of performance status and overall disease-related symptoms\n7. Has at least one extracranial tumor safely treatable with radical-dose radiation therapy and that has not been previously treated with radiation\n8. ECOG performance status 0-2\n9. Has the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
