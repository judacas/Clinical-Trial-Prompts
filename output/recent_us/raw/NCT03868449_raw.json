    "official_title": "A Pilot Study of Radiation De-Escalation for p16 Negative Oropharyngeal Cancer and p16-Negative or Positive Laryngeal and Hypopharyngeal Cancers",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Histologically confirmed diagnosis of SCC of the head and neck (excluding nasopharynx, nasal cavity/paranasal sinus, oral cavity, salivary, thyroid, and cutaneous primary malignancies).\n\n  * Any unknown primary SCC of the head and neck with radiographically detectable gross nodes is allowed (core or excisional biopsy acceptable; if excisional biopsy is performed, there must be residual radiographically detectable nodal disease; FNA may be acceptable only with PI and/or co-PI approval)\n  * If the primary site is oropharynx or unknown primary, P16 IHC must be negative.\n  * If the primary site is hypopharynx or larynx, any P16 status is acceptable (positive, negative, or unknown). P16 IHC is strongly encouraged when possible.\n* Clinical stage T0-3 N1-2C M0 (AJCC 7th edition) without evidence of distant metastasis based on staging FDG PET/CT.\n* 18 years of age or older.\n* Must not have received prior radiation therapy or chemotherapy for HNC.\n* Patients who have had their primary site tumor removed by surgery but still have residual grossly enlarged, radiographically detectable lymph nodes are eligible for this study.\n* Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) ≥ 70.\n* CT or MRI of the Neck with and without contrast\n\n  o Note: A CT scan of the Neck and/or a PET/CT performed for the purposes of radiation planning may serve as planning tools.\n* Adequate hematologic function within 30 days prior to registration, defined as follows:\n\n  * White Blood Count (WBC) ≥ 2,000 cells/µL\n  * Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,000 cells/mm3\n  * Platelets ≥ 100,000 cells/mm3\n  * Hemoglobin ≥ 8.0 g/dL; Note: The use of transfusion or other interventions to achieve Hgb ≥ 8.0 g/dL is acceptable\n* Adequate renal function within 30 days prior to registration, defined as follows:\n\n  * Serum creatinine < 1.5 mg/dL or creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥ 50 mL/min determined by 24-hour collection or estimated by Cockcroft-Gault formula: CrCl male = [(140 - age) x (weight in kg)] / [(Serum Cr mg/dL) x (72)] CrCl female = 0.85 x (CrCl male)\n  * Patients with serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL can be eligible for carboplatin-based chemotherapy with approval of co-PI (Dr. Eric Sherman\n* Adequate hepatic function within 30 days prior to registration, defined as follows:\n\n  * Bilirubin < 2 mg/dL\n  * AST or ALT < 3 x the upper limit of normal\n* Negative serum pregnancy test within 14 days prior to registration for women of childbearing potential.\n* The subject/legally authorized representative (LAR) must provide study-specific informed consent prior to study entry.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* All nasopharyngeal, nasal cavity/paranasal sinus, oral cavity, salivary gland, thyroid, and cutaneous primary malignancies.\n* Any T4 or N3 patients\n* Any prior radiotherapy to the head and neck region.\n* Any prior systemic chemotherapy for the study cancer; note that prior chemotherapy for a different non-H&N cancer is permissible.\n* Prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy within the last three years.\n* Patients who underwent previous surgical resection for the same disease (except for biopsy or surgery removing primary site tumor but still present with grossly enlarged, radiographically detectable lymph nodes).\n* Prior invasive malignancy (except non-melanomatous skin cancer) unless disease free for 3 years or if cure rate from treatment at 5 years estimated to be ≥ 90%.\n* Subjects with simultaneous primary cancers outside of the oropharynx\n\n  o Note: Exceptions can be made for patients with simultaneous primaries outside the H&N if determined by the PI/Co-PI that the patient can proceed with protocol activities.\n* Pregnant (confirmed by serum b-HCG in women of reproductive age) or breastfeeding.\n* Severe, active co-morbidities defined as follows:\n\n  * Unstable angina and/or congestive heart failure requiring hospitalization within the last 6 months.\n  * Transmural myocardial infarction within the last 6 months.\n  * Acute bacterial or fungal infection requiring intravenous antibiotics at the time of registration.\n  * Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease exacerbation or other respiratory illness requiring hospitalization or precluding study therapy within 30 days of registration.\n  * Hepatic Insufficiency resulting in clinical jaundice and/or coagulation defects.",
