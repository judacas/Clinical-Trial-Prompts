Patients who are post-menopausal or permanently sterilized can be considered as not having reproductive potential.\n* WOCBP must agree to use highly effective contraception during the trial and for 6 months after receiving the last dose of BNT152 or BNT153. Birth control methods are considered highly effective if they have a failure rate of less than 1% per year, when used consistently and correctly.\n* WOCBP must agree not to donate eggs (ova, oocytes) for the purposes of assisted reproduction during the entire trial, until 6 months after last BNT152 or BNT153 treatment.\n* A man who is sexually active with a WOCBP and has not had a vasectomy must agree to use a barrier method of birth control, e.g., either condom with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository or partner with occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository, and all men must also agree to not donate sperm during the trial and for 6 months after receiving the last dose of BNT152 or BNT153.\n* For enrollment into the biomarker cohort only: The biomarker cohort will be conducted at selected sites only. At enrollment patients must have at least one lesion that is deemed accessible by the investigator which is different from the target lesion. Also, patients must agree to have one pre-dose biopsy (baseline) and at least one on-treatment biopsy (preferred C2D8) from the same tumor lesion.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "Prior and concomitant therapy:\n\n* Use of any investigational medical product or device within 28 days before administration of first dose of trial treatment.\n* Has been receiving: radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or molecularly-targeted agents or tyrosine kinase inhibitors within 2 weeks or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) of the start of trial treatment; immunotherapy/monoclonal antibodies for systemic anticancer treatment within 3 weeks of the start of trial treatment; nitrosourea, antibody-drug conjugates, or radioactive isotopes within 6 weeks of the start of trial treatment.\n* Ongoing participation in the active treatment phase of an interventional clinical trial.\n* Receives concurrent systemic (oral or intravenous) steroid therapy >10 mg prednisone daily or its physiological equivalent for an underlying condition.\n* Has had major surgery within the 4 weeks before the first dose of trial treatment.\n* Ongoing or active infection requiring intravenous treatment with anti-infective therapy that has been administered less than 2 weeks prior to the first dose of trial treatment.\n* Has side effects of any prior therapy or procedures for any medical condition not recovered to NCI CTCAE v.5 Grade ≤ 1.
