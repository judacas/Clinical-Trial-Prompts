    "official_title": "A First-in-Human Study of HLA-Partially to Fully Matched Allogenic Cryopreserved Deceased Donor Bone Marrow Transplantation for Patients with Hematologic Malignancies",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Patient has the ability to provide informed consent according to the applicable regulatory and local institutional requirements\n* Male or female, aged ≥18 and ≤65 years for patients receiving MAC (Regimen A or Regimen B); aged ≥18 and ≤75 years for patients receiving RIC (Regimen C or D)\n* Patient must require allogeneic HCT per the discretion of the treating physician\n* Patient must be high-resolution, HLA partially or fully matched (4-8/8 allele matched at HLA-A, -B, -C, DRB1) to an available Ossium HPC, Marrow product\n* Stated willingness to comply with all study procedures and availability for the duration of the study\n* Diagnosed with malignant hematologic disease including:\n\n  1. Acute leukemia [acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute biophenotypic leukemia (ABL), or acute undifferentiated leukemia (AUL)], MDS without fibrosis, or chronic leukemia (CLL, CML) in the first remission or beyond with ≤5% marrow blasts documented by bone marrow assessment and no circulating blasts or extra-medullary disease within 42 days prior to anticipated start of conditioning\n  2. Chemosensitive non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, Hodgkin's lymphoma, or cutaneous T cell lymphomas in the first remission or beyond documented by PET/CT imaging and bone marrow assessment within 42 days prior to anticipated start of conditioning\n* Karnofsky performance status score ≥70% (MAC) or ≥60% (RIC)\n* HCT comorbidity index (HCT-CI) ≤5\n* Adequate organ function defined as:\n\n  1. Cardiac: LVEF at rest ≥40% (RIC) or LVEF at rest ≥45% (MAC)\n  2. Pulmonary: DLCO, FEV1, FVC ≥50% predicted by pulmonary function tests (PFTs). DLCO value may be corrected for hemoglobin.\n  3. Hepatic: total bilirubin ≤2.0 mg/dL, and ALT, AST, and ALP <3 x upper limit normal (ULN), unless ALT, AST, and/or ALP are disease related\n  4. Renal: SCr within 1.5x normal range for age. If SCr is outside normal range for age, CrCl> 60 mL/min/1.73m2 must be obtained (measured by 24-hour urine specimen or nuclear glomerular filtration rate (GFR), or calculated GFR)\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 75 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Availability of suitable graft from living donor (defined as 7/8 or 8/8 HLA-matched related or unrelated donors, haploidentical donors, or cord blood donors)\n* Prior autologous or allogeneic HCT\n* Pregnancy or lactation\n* Ongoing treatment with an investigational drug used for disease-related treatment within 5 half-lives of the drug\n* Current uncontrolled bacterial, viral or fungal infection defined as currently taking medication with evidence of progression of clinical symptoms or radiologic findings\n* Any condition(s) or diagnosis, both physical or psychological, or physical exam finding that in the investigator's opinion precludes participation",
