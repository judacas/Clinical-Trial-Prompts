    "official_title": "Phase I Study of Mesenchymal Stromal Cells-Derived Exosomes With KrasG12D siRNA for Metastatic Pancreas Cancer Patients Harboring KrasG12D Mutation",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Patients with histologically confirmed metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma harboring KrasG12D mutation\n* Patients must have documented progression or stable disease on one or more lines of systemic therapy. If stable disease, patient must have completed at least 4 months of chemotherapy with cytotoxic therapy\n* KrasG12D mutation status will be informed from any previous routine molecular profiling (using commercial assays such as Foundation One, Caris, Oncomine or other) of tissue or blood. Additional KrasG12D mutation status may be confirmed using tissue biopsy or blood prior to enrolling into the trial\n* ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status of 0-1\n* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) more or equal to 1,500 cells/mm3\n* Platelets more or equal to 100,000/ul\n* Hemoglobin more than 9.0 g/dL\n* Total bilirubin between 1 and 1.5 mg/dL\n* AST (aspartate aminotransferase) and ALT (alanine transaminase) less than 2.5 x ULN (upper limit of normal)\n* Alkaline phosphatase less than 2.5 x ULN\n* Creatinine less than 1.5 gm/dL\n* In patients with known Gilbert's syndrome, direct bilirubin less or equal to 1.5 x ULN will be used as organ function criteria, instead of total bilirubin\n* Negative serum pregnancy test in women with childbearing potential (WOCBP) defined as not post-menopausal for 12 months or no previous surgical sterilization, within one week prior to initiation of treatment. WOCBP must be using an adequate method of contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout the study and for up to 12 weeks after the last dose of study drug to minimize the risk of pregnancy. WOCBP must be using an adequate method of contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout the study and for up to 12 weeks after the last dose of study drug to minimize the risk of pregnancy\n* A male subject of fathering potential must use an adequate method of contraception to avoid conception throughout the study and for up to 12 weeks after the last dose of study drug to minimize the risk of pregnancy. If the partner is pregnant or breastfeeding, the subject must use a condom\n* Patients must sign an informed consent and authorization indicating that they are aware of the investigational nature of this study and the known risks involved\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions which could compromise participation in the study such as unstable angina, myocardial infarction within 6 months, unstable symptomatic arrhythmia, uncontrolled diabetes, serious active or uncontrolled infection\n* Pregnancy (positive pregnancy test) or lactation\n* Known CNS (central nervous system) disease, except for treated brain metastasis. Treated brain metastases are defined as having no evidence of progression or hemorrhage after treatment and no ongoing requirement for dexamethasone, as ascertained by clinical examination and brain imaging (magnetic resonance imaging-MRI or computerized tomography-CT) during the screening period. Anticonvulsants (stable dose) are allowed. Treatment for brain metastases may include whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT), radiosurgery (RS; gamma knife, linear accelerator [LINAC], or equivalent) or a combination as deemed appropriate by the treating physician. Patients with CNS metastases treated by neurosurgical resection or brain biopsy performed within 3 months prior to day 1 will be excluded",
