    "exclusion_criteria": "* Evidence of muscle-invasive, locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer or concurrent extravesical, non-muscle invasive TCC of the urothelium\n* (Cohort A only): Intravesical BCG therapy within 2 years prior to randomization. Prior intravesical chemotherapy for NMIBC is allowed.\n\n(Cohorts B1 and B2 only): Any systemic or intravesical chemotherapy or immunotherapy from the time of most recent positive TURBT to initiation of study intervention.\n\n* Prior immunotherapy with anti PD-1, anti PD-L1, anti PD-L2, or anti cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) antibody\n* Prior treatment with immunostimulatory agents including interleukin (IL)-2, IL-15, interferon (INF)\n* Prior radiation therapy to the bladder\n* (Cohorts B1 and B2 only): Prior participation in Cohort A of this study.",
