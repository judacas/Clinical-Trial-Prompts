Highly effective contraceptive measures include:\n\n  * Stable use of combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception (oral, intravaginal, transdermal) or progestogen-only hormonal contraception (oral, injectable, implantable) associated with inhibition of ovulation initiated 2 or more menstrual cycles prior to screening;\n  * Intrauterine device; intrauterine hormone-releasing system;\n  * Bilateral tubal occlusion/ligation;\n  * Vasectomized partner (provided that the male vasectomized partner is the sole sexual partner of the WOCBP study participant and that the vasectomized partner has obtained medical assessment of surgical success for the procedure); and/or\n  * Sexual abstinence\n  * Pregnancy testing and contraception are required for WOCBP. Pregnancy testing and contraception are not required for women who are postmenopausal or permanently sterile\n  * WOCBP are defined as women who are fertile following menarche until becoming postmenopausal, unless permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy\n  * A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient to determine the occurrence of a postmenopausal state. The above definitions are according to the Clinical Trials Facilitation and Coordination Group (CTFG) guidance. Pregnancy testing and contraception are not required for women with documents hysterectomy or tubal ligation\n  * Male participants: A male participant will be excluded from the study if that participant does not agree to use condoms or practice sexual abstinence, unless vasectomized, prior to the initial dose/start of study medication, during the study, and for at least 6 months after the last dose. Sperm donation is also prohibited during the same period. Vasectomy success must be confirmed by semen analysis\n  * Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study drugs. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant\n* Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea method are not acceptable methods of contraception. Female condom and male condom should not be used together",
