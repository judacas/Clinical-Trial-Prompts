    "inclusion_criteria": "* Documented informed consent of the subject and/or legally authorized representative.\n* Agreement to allow the use of archival tissue from diagnostic tumor biopsies.\n* Age 18 years and older.\n* ECOG status of 0 or 1.\n* Life expectancy ≥12 weeks.\n* Subject has a prior histologically confirmed diagnosis of a grade 4 glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) or a prior histologically confirmed diagnosis of a grade 2 or 3 malignant glioma and now has radiographic progression consistent with a grade 4 GBM (IDH wild type), grade 4 diffuse astrocytoma (IDH mutant), or has a unifocal relapse of GBM.\n* Relapsed disease: radiographic evidence of recurrence/progression of measurable disease after standard therapy and ≥ 12 weeks after completion of front-line radiation therapy.\n* Confirmed MMP2+ tumor expression by IHC (≥20% moderate/high MMP2 score [2+ or 3+]).\n* Adequate venous access to perform leukapheresis.\n* No known contraindications to leukapheresis or steroids.\n* In-range baseline laboratory values for WBC (>2000/dL [or ANC ≥1000/mm^3]), platelets (≥75000/mm^3), total bilirubin (≤1.5xULN), AST (≤2.5xULN), ALT (≤2.5xULN), serum creatinine (≤1.5xmg/dL), and oxygen saturation (≥95% on room air)\n* Seronegative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) by antigen/antibody (Ag/Ab) testing.\n* Seronegative for hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus.\n* Women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test is required.\n* Agreement by women AND men of childbearing potential to use an effective method of birth control or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course of the study through at least 3 months after the last dose of CHM-1101. (Childbearing potential is defined as not being surgically sterilized (women and men) or, for women, having not been free from menses for > 1 year.)\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Within 3 months of having received prior bevacizumab therapy at the time of enrollment.\n* Not yet recovered from toxicities of prior therapy.\n* Uncontrolled seizure activity and/or clinically evident progressive encephalopathy.\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to study agent.\n* Clinically significant uncontrolled illness.\n* Active infection requiring antibiotics.\n* Known history of HIV or hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection.\n* Other active malignancy.\n* Women only-pregnant or breastfeeding.\n* Any other condition that would, in the Investigator's judgment, contraindicate the subject's participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns with clinical study procedures.\n* Prospective subjects who, in the opinion of the Investigator, may not be able to comply with all study procedures (including compliance issues related to feasibility/logistics).",
