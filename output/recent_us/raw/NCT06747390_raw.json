    "inclusion_criteria": "* Age ≥ 18\n* Histologically confirmed clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) (ccRCC) (based on partial/radical nephrectomy/metastasectomy)\n\n  * For tumors with extensive sarcomatoid features, if there is evidence of areas of clear cell and high CAIX expression throughout the tumor on immunohistochemistry, they will be allowed on study\n* Subjects must have undergone definitive treatment of their primary tumor (partial/radical nephrectomy) +/- resection of metastatic disease to no evidence of disease (NED) with a prior nephrectomy < 2 years)\n* Surgery must have been performed between 4-16 weeks at the time of planned imaging\n* Subjects are considered to have a high risk of recurrence based on the following criteria:\n\n  * Intermediate-high risk ccRCC:\n\n    * pathologic tumor stage 2 (pT2), grade 4, or sarcomatoid, N0, M0\n    * pathologic tumor stage 3 (pT3), any grade, N0, M0\n  * High risk ccRCC:\n\n    * pathologic tumor stage 4 (pT4), any grade, N0, M0\n    * pT any stage, any grade, number of positive nodes (pN+), M0\n  * M1 now NED: pathologically-confirmed ccRCC, undergoing a resection of a solitary, isolated soft tissue metastasis within two years from initial nephrectomy\n* Negative serum pregnancy tests in female patients of childbearing potential. (Women of child bearing potential [WOCBP] require a negative pregnancy test within 24 hours (urine) prior to receiving investigational product)\n* Consent to practice double-barrier contraception until a minimum of 42 days after 89Zr-DFO-GmAb administration\n* Individual must be able to remain still and lie flat for duration of the diagnostic imaging procedure (less than 1 hour)\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Inability to provide written informed consent\n* Any evidence of residual disease or known metastasis at the time of planned 89Zr-DFO-GmAb administration\n* Prior post-operative imaging for confirmation of disease status\n* An untreated non-renal malignancy with the following exceptions:\n\n  * Low risk prostate cancer on active surveillance (National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN] very low/low risk)\n  * Non-melanoma skin cancer\n* Any prior treated malignancy meeting the following characteristics:\n\n  * Treated stage I or II cancer from which the patient is currently in complete remission\n  * A stage III cancer from which the patient is progressing or has been disease-free for and has required active treatment (e.g. adjuvant or maintenance therapy) within the past 3 years prior to enrollment\n  * A hematologic malignancy from which the patient is currently in complete remission\n* Contraindication to the use of iodinated contrast-enhanced CT agents, based on:\n\n  * Severe allergy (for which pre-medication cannot limit adverse reactions) or\n  * Estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ≤ 30 ml/min/1.73m^2\n* Prior use of systemic therapy treatment for kidney cancer (PD-1, PD-L1, tyrosine kinase or TOR inhibitor) or radiotherapy within 4 weeks of enrollment\n* Exposure to experimental diagnostic or therapeutic drug within 14 days from date of planned administration\n* Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding\n* Known hypersensitivity to girentuximab\n* Known inability to remain still and lie flat imaging procedure (about 30 minutes)",
