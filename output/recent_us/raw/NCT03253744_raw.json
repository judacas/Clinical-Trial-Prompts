    "exclusion_criteria": "* Small cell or other variant (non-adenocarcinoma) prostate cancer histology\n* Prior treatment for prostate cancer, including androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), orchiectomy, antiandrogens, ketoconazole, abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide\n* Prior radiation to the prostate\n* Patients may not be receiving other investigational agents or be receiving concurrent anticancer therapy other than the treatment-prescribed androgen deprivation therapy\n* Treatment with any of the following medications while on study is prohibited, washout period not required except as indicated:\n\n  * Systemic corticosteroids (at doses over the equivalent of 10 mg prednisone daily) - not permitted within 3 months of registration; inhaled, intranasal or topical corticosteroids are acceptable\n  * PC-SPES\n  * Herbal supplements that have been shown to modulate testosterone or androgen signaling (e.g. Saw Palmetto) are not allowed while on study\n  * Megestrol\n  * Ketoconazole\n  * 5-α-reductase inhibitors - patients already taking 5-α-reductase inhibitors prior to 28 days prior to registration may stay on these agents throughout the course of therapy, but these should not be started while patients are on study\n  * Diethylstilbesterol\n  * Any other non-study hormonal agent or supplement being used with the intent of cancer treatment\n* Major surgery within 4 weeks of registration is prohibited\n* Active cardiac disease defined as active angina, symptomatic congestive heart failure, or myocardial infarction within 6 months of registration\n* Patients with known psychological or sociological conditions, addictive disorders or family problems, which would preclude compliance with the protocol\n* Patients who have undergone splenectomy\n* Patients must not have other active malignancies other than non-melanoma skin cancers or superficial bladder cancer (this includes any non-muscle invasive bladder cancer including Ta, CIS and T1), that have been adequately treated. Subjects with a history of other cancers who have been adequately treated and have been recurrence-free for > 3 years are eligible.\n* Any other medical intervention or condition, which, in the opinion of the principle investigator (PI) or treating physician, could compromise patient safety or adherence with the study requirements over the primary 3-6 month treatment period.\n* Patients who have concurrent enrollment on other phase I, II, or III investigational treatment studies cannot be actively receiving treatment and the last dose cannot be within 4 weeks.\n* Patients who have received a live vaccine within 14 days prior to the first dose of study treatment. Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster (chicken pox), yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (eg, FluMist®) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed\n* Patients with a history of life-threatening autoimmune disease or active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment\n* Patients with a history of non-infectious pneumonitis that required corticosteroid treatment, or has current pneumonitis\n* Patients with a history of allergic reactions to the tetanus vaccine",
