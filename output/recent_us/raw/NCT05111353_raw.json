    "exclusion_criteria": "* Patients who are suspected or proven to have acute promyelocytic leukemia based on morphology, immunophenotype, molecular assay, or karyotype are not eligible\n* Patients who have had prior therapy with ivosidenib are not eligible.\n\n  * Note: prior treatment with other IDH inhibitors are allowed\n* Patients who have immediate life-threatening, uncontrolled medical problem that would prevent treatment on a clinical trial per investigator's discretion are not eligible\n* Patients who have significant active cardiac disease within 28 days prior to study registration, including New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV congestive heart failure; acute coronary syndrome (ACS); and/or stroke; or left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 40% by echocardiogram (ECHO) or multi-gated acquisition (MUGA) scan obtained within 28 days prior to study registration are not eligible\n* Patients who have prior history of malignancy, other than MDS, MPN, or AML are not eligible unless the subject has been free of the disease for >= 1 year prior to the start of study treatment. However, subjects with the following history/concurrent conditions are allowed:\n\n  * Basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin\n  * Carcinoma in situ of the cervix\n  * Carcinoma in situ of the breast Incidental histologic finding of prostate cancer (T1a or T1b using the tumor, node, metastasis clinical staging system)\n* Patients who are known to have short-gut syndrome, gastroparesis, or other conditions that limit the ingestion or gastrointestinal absorption of drugs administered orally are not eligible\n* Patients who are taking the following sensitive CYP substrate medications that have a narrow therapeutic range are excluded from the study unless the subject can be transferred to other medications at least 5 half-lives or 14 days whichever is shorter prior to the start of study treatment: phenytoin (CYP2C9), S-mephenytoin (CYP2C19), thioridazine (CYP2D6), theophylline, tizanidine (CYP1A2), CYP2C8, CYP3A4/5, and CYP2B6\n* Patients who are known to be taking strong CYP3A4 inducers or sensitive CYP3A4 substrate medications that have a narrow therapeutic window are not eligible, unless they can be transferred to other medications within >= 5 half-lives prior to dosing or unless the medications can be properly monitored during the study\n* Patients with an active uncontrolled systemic fungal, bacterial, or viral infection (defined as ongoing signs/symptoms related to the infection without improvement despite appropriate antibiotics, antiviral therapy, and/or other treatment) are not eligible\n* Patients who have known or suspected hypersensitivity to any of the components of study therapy are not eligible\n* Patient who has corrected QT (QTc) interval (Frederica's correction [QTcF]) >= 480 ms) at screening unless attributable to bundle branch block or pacemaker are not eligible.
