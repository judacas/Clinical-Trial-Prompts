For PTEN and PIK3CA/AKT status test:\n\n   Phase I: The PTEN/PIK3CA/AKT status test is optional and the result could be either positive, negative, undetermined or invalid. Phase II: Patients will be allowed to enroll regardless of the biomarker status, medical monitor review is necessary before enrollment. The biomarker status tests will be performed with the following order. The biomarker results of all enrolled patients will be used for retrospective analysis purposes.\n   * Patients that have a documentation of \"PTEN LOSS\" and/or PTEN/PIK3CA/AKT alteration from a previous test on either tissue or liquid biopsy (e.g., IHC or next generation sequencing NGS), no further biomarker tests are needed in this study.\n   * Patients who have PTEN or PI3KPIK3CA/AKT alteration status reported other than \"PTEN LOSS\", \"PIK3CA/AKT alterations\" or never completed any PTEN/PIK3CA/AKT test before, could either provide the archival tumor samples collected at any time before study enrollment or do a fresh core tumor biopsy.\n   * As the last option, patients can perform a liquid biopsy for PTEN LOSS and PTEN/PIK3CA/AKT alteration tests by NGS of cfDNA if they have no archival tissue to provide, no tumor lesion for biopsy or a fresh biopsy is not feasible.\n5.
