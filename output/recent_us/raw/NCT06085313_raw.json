    "official_title": "Resveratrol and Sirolimus in Lymphangioleiomyomatosis Trial (RESULT)",
    "inclusion_criteria": "Subjects enrolled in the trial must meet all of the following criteria.\n\n1. Definitive diagnosis LAM based on the presence of characteristic cystic change on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest. The diagnosis must be confirmed by one of the following:\n\n   A) Histopathological confirmation by biopsy (lung, abdominal mass, lymph node or kidney or cytology from thoracic or abdominal sources revealing human melanoma black-45 (HMB45)+ staining of spindled/epithelioid cells) B) Compatible chest CT scan findings in the setting of tuberous sclerosis, angiomyolipomas (diagnosed by CT, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) by the site radiologist or biopsy) or chylous pleural effusion (verified by tap) C) Chest CT scan findings compatible with LAM and a VEGF-D level â‰¥ 800pg/ml.\n2. Age 18 years or greater.\n3. Signed and dated informed consent\n4. Currently on sirolimus for treatment of LAM for at least 20 weeks\n5. Evidence of disease stabilization on sirolimus as demonstrated by two stable values of serum VEGF-D post initiation of sirolimus drawn at least 12 weeks apart from each other. For the purpose of this study, a variation in serum VEGF-D of less than or equal to 15% is considered stable.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be FEMALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
