Has adequate bone marrow, liver, and renal function as assessed by the following laboratory requirements conducted within 7 days before C1D1 (Note: labs will also be repeated pre-dose on C1D1 to confirm eligibility): a. Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL (≥90 g/L) b. Adequate renal function by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) defined as a creatinine clearance >50 mL/min (>0.84 mL/s) (Cockcroft-Gault equation) and normalized to body surface area c. Peripheral absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of ≥1.5×109/L d. Platelet count of ≥100×109/L without growth factor/transfusion e. Total bilirubin <1.5× upper limit of normal (ULN); or ≤3×ULN if the patient has Gilbert's disease f. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) <2.5×ULN, with liver metastasis <5×ULN g. International normalized ratio (INR) <1.5 and prothrombin time (PT) ≤1.5×ULN, unless both of the following conditions are met: i. Patient is receiving anticoagulant therapy, and ii. PT or partial thromboplastin time (PTT) is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulant h. Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) ≤1.5×ULN, unless both of the following conditions are met: i. Patient is receiving anticoagulant therapy, and ii. PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",

Has history or presence of clinically significant abnormal 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) results, in the Medical Monitor or Investigator's opinion\n   2. Has prolonged QTc (with Fridericia's correction) of >480 msec performed at Screening\n   3. Has a history of prolonged QTc interval, ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation or significant ventricular arrhythmia, or Torsades de Pointes, or a history of ventricular ablation for arrhythmia\n   4. Has congenital long QT syndrome or a family history of long QT syndrome\n   5. Has other clinically significant cardiac disease including, but not limited to, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, cardiac or other vascular stenting, angioplasty, or surgery ≤12 months prior to randomization, congestive heart failure\n\n      * Class II per the New York Heart Association, or history of myocarditis\n7.
