Subjects are eligible if they have progressed after ASCT OR if they are ineligible for ASCT, as determined by their treating physician.\n\nR/R FL Cohort:\n\n1.

Known hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs\n3. History of other malignancy that could affect compliance with the protocol or interpretation of results\n\n   a. Patients with a history of curatively treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or in situ carcinoma of the cervix are generally eligible. Patients with a malignancy that has been treated, but not with curative intent, will also be excluded, unless the malignancy has been in remission without treatment for 2 years prior to enrollment.\n4. Known CNS involvement at diagnosis (CNS evaluation not required in the absence of clinical suspicion)\n5. Richter's transformation from CLL\n6. Evidence of other clinically significant uncontrolled condition(s) including, but not limited to, uncontrolled systemic infection (viral, bacterial, or fungal).\n7. Major surgery within 3 weeks prior to the start of study treatment\n8. Venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism within the last 3 months before starting study; whereas subjects greater than 3 months since deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism are eligible but are recommended to receive prophylaxis.\n9. Uncontrolled infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or human T-cell leukemia virus 1\n10. Pregnant or lactating\n11. Patients capable of becoming pregnant or getting someone else pregnant must be willing to use highly effective birth control as described in Section 4.4\n12.

Inability to swallow tablets\n14. Known allergy to both xanthine oxidase inhibitors and rasburicase\n15. Clinically significant history of liver disease, including but not limited to viral or other hepatitis, current alcohol abuse, or cirrhosis Note: Subjects with positive HBV core antibody or surface antigen are eligible as long as they have an undetectable HBV DNA PCR and are willing to undergo monthly DNA testing, and receive concurrent antiviral therapy with entecavir, tenofovir, or lamivudine, and continued for a minimum of 6 months after completion of therapy.\n16. Active hepatitis C (defined as a positive HCV viral load)\n17. Chronic use of moderate or strong CYP3A4 modulators (inhibitor or inducer) or any other prohibited medications. A washout period of 5 half-lives or 14 days, whichever is longer, is required prior to venetoclax or tazemetostat dosing if a prohibited medication is discontinued.\n18. Chronic use of a P-gp inhibitor, or a P-gp substrate with a narrow therapeutic index (see Section 7.8). A washout period of 5 half-lives or 14 days, whichever is longer is required prior to venetoclax or tazemetostat dosing if a prohibited medication is discontinued.\n19. Prior exposure to either tazemetostat or venetoclax\n20. Has a prior history of T-LBL/T-ALL\n21. Subjects who have undergone a solid organ transplant\n22. Any other major illness that, in the Investigator's judgment, will substantially increase the risk associated with the subject's participation in this study OR interfere with their ability to receive study treatment or complete the study.\n23. Requires the use of warfarin (because of potential drug-drug interactions that may potentially increase the exposure of warfarin)\n24.
