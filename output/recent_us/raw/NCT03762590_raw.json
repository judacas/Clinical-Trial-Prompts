    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Age ≥ 18 years.\n2. Able to understand and sign a written informed consent document.\n3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0, 1 or 2.\n4. Relapsed or refractory to at least two (2) prior standard systemic treatment regimen for CLL or SLL (USA).\n\n   Relapsed or refractory to at least two (2) prior standard systemic treatment regimen for CLL or SLL and without available therapies known to provide clinical benefit (until new amendment implemented, Spain).\n5. Prior CLL or SLL systemic therapy must have been discontinued for a duration of at least five times its half-life (palliative low dose steroids are allowed to bridge the time to CAP-100; major surgery or irradiation for CLL must have been completed > 4 weeks prior to the first trial dose of medication). Prior chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy is allowed.\n6. Life expectancy > 16 weeks.\n7. Subjects must have met the diagnostic criteria for CLL according to the iwCLL 2018 guidelines (Hallek et al, 2018) or for SLL (NCCN guidelines, 2020) at some point during their disease course.\n8. Subjects must meet iwCLL 2018 guideline criteria (Hallek et al, 2018) for active disease.\n9. Platelet count ≥ 50,000/ μL, unless decrease is attributable to bone marrow infiltration of CLL.\n10. Adequate liver function as indicated by aspartate transaminase (AST)/ alanine transaminase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN), unless directly attributable to the subject's tumor (in this case, acceptable levels are ≤ 5 x ULN).\n11. Renal function as defined by creatinine clearance (CrCl)≥ 45 mL/min/1.73m2 (by CKD-EPI formula).\n12. Women of childbearing potential and male subjects who have partners capable of reproduction must agree to use an effective contraceptive method during the course of the trial and for 4 months following the completion of their last treatment. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum β-subunit of hCG gonadotropin (β-hCG) pregnancy test result within 7 days of first trial dose. Female subjects who are surgically sterilized or who are > 45 years old and have not experienced menses for > 2 years may have β-hCG pregnancy test waived.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Allogeneic stem-cell transplantation within 6 months of trial entry.\n2. Monoclonal antibody for anti-cancer therapy within 4 weeks of trial entry.\n3. Side effects due to prior therapy not recovered to ≤Grade 1.\n4. Oral targeted inhibitors (Bruton's tyrosine kinase [BTK]-inhibitors, B-cell lymphoma 2 [BCL-2] inhibitors, phosphoinositide 3-kinase [PI3K] inhibitors) within five times their half-life.\n5. Active viral, bacterial or systemic fungal infection requiring treatment.\n6. Subjects who are known to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive.\n7. Subjects with active known central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma.\n8. Pregnant or lactating women.\n9. History of previous cancer < 2 years before the trial, except controlled disease using systemic therapy with curative intent, surgical therapy with curative intent or skin cancer, cancer in situ, and prostate cancer on the \"watch and wait\" approach.\n10. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, New York Heart Association Class (NYHA) III and IV congestive heart failure, myocardial infraction within the previous 6 months, ejection fraction (EF) < 40%, life-threatening arrhythmias, or unstable angina brain metastasis or psychiatric illness that would limit compliance with trial requirement.\n11. Subjects with known hypersensitivity to any excipient contained in the drug formulation.\n12. Subjects with a history of documented human anti-globulin antibodies.\n13. Active autoimmune disease, motor neuropathy considered of autoimmune origin, and other CNS autoimmune disease.",
