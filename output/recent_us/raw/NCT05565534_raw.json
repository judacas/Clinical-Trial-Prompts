A male condom and an additional highly effective contraceptive method (Contraceptive and barrier guidance per protocol) when having sexual intercourse with a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) who is not currently pregnant.\n14. A female participant is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant or breastfeeding, and one of the following conditions applies:\n\n    * Is a woman of nonchildbearing potential (WONCBP) as defined by the protocol. OR\n    * Is a WOCBP and agrees to use a contraceptive method that is highly effective (with a failure rate of <1% per year), as described in the protocol during the study intervention period (to be effective before starting the intervention) and for at least 55 weeks after the last administration of study intervention and agrees not to donate or cryopreserve eggs (ova, oocytes) for the purpose of reproduction during this period.\n15. Participant must have a body weight at Screening of 35 kg to 154 kg (77 to 340 lbs) inclusive.\n16. Evidence of at least one clinically meaningful deterioration within 2 years, or at least 2 clinically meaningful deteriorations within 5 years prior to screening which occurred during period of interrupted dosing, reduced dosage, or extended intervals between doses of immunoglobin therapy, as verified by clinical examination or medical records.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "Participants are excluded from the study if any of the following criteria apply:\n\n1. Polyneuropathy of other causes, including but not limited to acute demyelinating polyneuropathies (eg. Guillain-Barré syndrome), hereditary demyelinating neuropathies, neuropathies secondary to infection or systemic disease, diabetic neuropathy, drug- or toxin-induced neuropathies, multifocal motor neuropathy, polyneuropathy related to IgM monoclonal gammopathy, POEMS syndrome, lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathy.\n2. Sensory CIDP, distal CIDP and focal CIDP variants.\n3. Any other neurological or systemic disease that can cause symptoms and signs interfering with treatment or outcome assessments.\n4. Poorly controlled diabetes (HbA1c glycated hemoglobin >7% at the Screening visit).\n5. Serious infections requiring hospitalization within 30 days prior to Screening, any active infection requiring treatment during Screening, or presence of a condition that may predispose the participant to increased risk of infection (eg, medical history such as known immunodeficiency or history of recurrent infections).\n6. Clinical diagnosis of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) or family history of SLE. For a participant with an antinuclear antibody (ANA) titer ≥1:160 and a positive anti double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) at Screening, SLE diagnosis must be ruled out prior to enrollment.\n7. Sensitivity to any of the study interventions, or components thereof, or drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the Investigator, contraindicates participation in the study. Specifically, history of any hypersensitivity reaction to riliprubart or its components or of a severe allergic or anaphylactic reaction to any humanized or murine monoclonal antibody.\n8.

Documented history of attempted suicide over the 6 months prior to the Screening visit, presence of suicidal ideation of category 4 or 5 on the C-SSRS during Screening, OR if in the Investigator's judgment, the participant is at risk for a suicide attempt.\n11. Evidence of CIDP worsening within the 6 weeks following a prior vaccination that, in the opinion of the Investigator, constituted a relapse.\n12. Recent or planned major surgery that could confound the results of the trial or put the participant at undue risk.\n13. Treatment with plasma exchange within 8 weeks prior to Screening.\n14. Treatment within 3 months prior to dosing with immunosuppressive/ immunomodulator medication, or corticosteroids (except ≤20 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent which is allowed), or prior treatment (at any time) with highly immunosuppressive/ chemotherapeutic medications with sustained effects (eg, mitoxantrone, alemtuzumab, or cladribine).\n15.

Participation in another clinical trial with an investigational drug or receipt of an investigational product within 12 weeks or 5 times the half-life of the product (whichever is longer) prior to Screening.\n21. Any Screening laboratory values outside normal limits or abnormal ECG considered in the Investigator's judgment to be clinically significant in the context of this trial.\n22.
