Use of corticosteroids (or ongoing prednisone =< 20 mg daily, or equivalent) for symptom control are permitted. Enrollment will be considered for those individuals that can taper ongoing use of a corticosteroid at > 20 mg daily to 0 mg within 14 days after C1D1\n* Known history of hypersensitivity to\n\n  * Humanized or murine monoclonal antibodies or products\n  * A CD19 or CD20 antibody\n  * Tafasitamab\n  * Acalabrutinib\n* Receipt of live vaccine within 14 days of trial enrollment\n* Prior history of any solid malignancy, unless disease-free for over 2 years, exclusive of any prior history of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or cervix, basal cell carcinoma of the skin, transitional cell urothelial carcinoma, prostate cancer, or early-stage melanoma. Exceptions will be considered, at the discretion of the investigator, if the prior treatment (i.e., within 2 years) is not expected to confound the results of this study\n* Patients with history of confirmed progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)\n* Active autoimmune disease requiring treatment with > 20 mg of prednisone (or prednisone equivalent daily), apart from autoimmune hemolytic anemia or immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP).\n* Evidence of ongoing systemic bacterial, fungal, or viral infection, except localized fungal infections of skin or nails.
