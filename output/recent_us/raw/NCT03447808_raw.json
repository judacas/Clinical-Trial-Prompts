Patients with previously treated brain metastases or carcinomatous meningitis may participate provided they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least four weeks prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using steroids for at least 7 day prior to trial treatment\n* Current use of immunosuppressive medication, EXCEPT for the following:\n\n  * intranasal, inhaled, topical steroids, or local steroid injection (e.g., intra-articular injection)\n  * Systemic corticosteroids at physiologic doses </= 10mg/day of prednisone or equivalent\n  * Steroids as premedication for hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., CT scan premedication)\n* Evidence of clinically significant immunosuppression such as the following:\n\n  * Primary immunodeficiency state such as Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Disease\n  * Concurrent opportunistic infection\n  * Receiving systemic immunosuppressive therapy (>2 weeks) including oral steroid doses > 10mg/day of prednisone or equivalent within 2 months prior to enrollment\n* History or evidence of symptomatic autoimmune disease (e.g., pneumonitis, glomerulonephritis, vasculitis, or other), or history of active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment (i.e., use of corticosteroids, immunosuppressive drugs or biological agents used for treatment of autoimmune diseases) in past 2 years prior to enrollment. Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine for hypothyroidism, insulin for diabetes or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency) is not considered a form of systemic treatment for autoimmune disease\n* Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies) disease that is not controlled\n* Patients known to be positive for active Hepatitis B (HBsAg reactive with detectable HBV DNA), or Hepatitis C (HCV RNA (qualitative) is detected)\n\n  ° Patients with chronic hepatitis B (positive HBsAg and/or HBcAb and negative HBV DNA by PCR) are eligible for this study if deemed safe by a gastroenterologist\n* Prolonged QTcF > 450 ms for men and >470 ms for women at Screening\n* Patients who have received a live vaccine within 30 days of the start date of the planned study therapy. Note: Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist) are live attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed\n* Has a known history of active TB (Bacillus Tuberculosis)\n* Is currently participating and receiving study therapy or has participated in a study of an investigational agent and received study therapy or used an investigational device within 4 weeks of the first dose of treatment\n* Has had a prior anti-cancer monoclonal antibody (mAb) within 3 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., </= Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier\n* Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy within 2 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., </= Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to a previously administered agent\n\n  * Note: Alopecia, neuropathy Grade </= 2, or other Grade </= not constituting a safety risk based on investigator's judgment are acceptable\n  * Note: If patient received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting therapy events due to a previously administered agent\n* Patients who have received prior treatment with an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agent\n* Women who are pregnant or breast feeding\n* Patients expecting to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of study treatment(s)\n* Prior organ transplantation including allogenic stem-cell transplantation\n* Active infection requiring systemic therapy\n* Known prior severe hypersensitivity to investigational product or any component in its formulations, including known severe hypersensitivity reactions to monoclonal antibodies (NCI CTCAE v4.03 Grade >/= 3)\n* Other severe acute or chronic medical conditions including immune colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, immune pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis or psychiatric conditions including recent (within the past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior; or laboratory abnormalities that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study treatment administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study",
