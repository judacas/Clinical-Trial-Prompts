    "exclusion_criteria": "* Participants with a diagnosis of ocular or metastatic uveal melanoma\n* Participants with a history of a malignant disease other than those being treated in this study. The following exceptions are permitted:\n* Malignancies that were treated curatively and have not recurred within 2 years. Shorter intervals can be considered after discussion with the Principal Investigator.\n* Completely resected basal cell and squamous cell skin cancers.\n* Any malignancy considered to be indolent and that has never required therapy, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia.\n* Completely resected carcinoma in situ of any type\n* Participants ineligible to be retreated with pembrolizumab due to a treatment-related AE while on a prior anti-PD(L)-1 regimen that led to discontinuation of that prior therapy and would thus prevent retreatment or with an immune-related adverse event (irAE) of grade 3 or greater\n* Participants with known untreated or symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. NOTE: Participants with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided ALL of the following apply:\n* Treated CNS lesions are radiographically stable (without evidence of progression for ≥ 28 days prior to the first dose of study intervention) after intervention (eg, surgery and/or radiation).\n* Neurologically stable and on stable dose of ≤ 10mg of prednisone equivalent steroids for at least 7 days prior to the first dose of study intervention.\n* Investigational or standard immunotherapy (with exception of pembrolizumab, nivolumab, or relatlimab), chemotherapy or radiation within 6-9 weeks of the first dose of the investigational therapy (see Inclusion Criteria)\n* Presence of B-RAF driver mutation without prior receipt of BRAF +/- MEK inhibitors, unless patient declines BRAF +/-MEK inhibition for any reason or is unable to tolerate BRAF and/or MEK inhibitors.\n* Participants with a known history of chronic viral infections as indicated below. If patients do not have a known history, testing is not required during the screening period to confirm the patient has an active infection.\n* Known HBV infection defined as hepatitis B surface antigen reactive. NOTE: Participants with HBV infection on stable anti-viral therapy for > 4 weeks prior to the planned first study intervention and viral load confirmed as undetectable during Screening may be eligible.\n* Known active HCV infection defined as detectable HCV RNA (qualitative) infection. NOTE: History of HCV is not exclusionary if participant has received curative treatment and viral load is confirmed as undetectable during Screening.\n* Active HIV infection. Those with HIV infections on combination antiretroviral medications with stable CD4 count >200/microliters as measured within screening time period. If the patient does not have a known history of HIV, then testing is not required during screening to confirm presence or absence of HIV.\n* Positive serum pregnancy test\n* Participants with out-of-range screening laboratory values as defined below. NOTE: Hematology evaluations must be performed >7 days from any blood transfusion. Or blood product transfusion or from any dose of hematologic growth factor.\n* Glomerular filtration rate (calculated using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration formula) < 30 mL/min\n* Total bilirubin > 1.5 × ULN; participants with Gilbert's syndrome are excluded if total bilirubin > 3.0 × ULN; or direct bilirubin > 1.5 × ULN\n* Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST): > 2.5 × ULN (> 5 × ULN for participants with liver metastases)\n* Albumin < 3.0 g/dL\n* Absolute neutrophil count < 1.5 × 10^9/L\n* Absolute lymphocyte count < 0.5 × 10^9/L\n* Platelet count < 100 × 10^9/L\n* Hemoglobin < 9 g/dL\n* Participants with a history of allogeneic tissue/solid organ transplant",
