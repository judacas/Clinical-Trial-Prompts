Single agent therapy with an anti-PD(L)1 agent for r/mCC cancer should be counted.\n* Measurable disease according to RECIST v1.1 as assessed by the investigator.\n* Has ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 prior to randomization.\n* Has life expectancy of at least 3 months.\n\nExclusion Criteria\n\n* Has primary neuroendocrine, lymphoid, sarcomatoid, or other histologies not mentioned as part of the inclusion criteria above.\n* Has clinically significant bleeding issues or risks. This includes known past or current coagulation defects leading to an increased risk of bleeding; diffuse alveolar hemorrhage from vasculitis; known bleeding diathesis; ongoing major bleeding; trauma with increased risk of life-threatening bleeding or history of severe head trauma or intracranial surgery within 8 weeks of trial entry.\n* Has any history of intracerebral arteriovenous malformation, cerebral aneurysm, or stroke (transient ischemic attack >1 month prior to screening is allowed).\n* Active ocular surface disease or a history of cicatricial conjunctivitis or inflammatory conditions that predispose to cicatrizing conjunctivitis (e.g. Wagner syndrome, atopic keratoconjunctivitis, autoimmune disease affecting the eyes), ocular Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis, mucus pemphigoid, and participants with penetrating ocular transplants. Cataracts alone is not an exclusion criterion.\n* Major surgery within 4 weeks or minor surgery within 7 days prior to the first study treatment administration.\n* Peripheral neuropathy â‰¥grade 2.\n* Any prior treatment with monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE)-containing drugs.\n\nThere are additional inclusion and exclusion criteria.
