    "exclusion_criteria": "* TRANSPLANT RELATED CRITERIA: Patients undergoing cord blood transplant (CB-HCT)\n* Any prior investigational CMV vaccine\n* Anti-CMV therapy in the last 6 months\n* Live attenuated vaccines\n* Medically indicated subunit (Engerix-B for HBV; Gardasil for human papillomavirus [HPV]) or killed vaccine (e.g. influenza, pneumococcal)\n* Allergy treatment with antigens injections\n* Alemtuzumab, cyclophosphamide, ATG or any equivalent in vivo T-cell depleting agent; Note: Pre-transplant ATG is permitted\n* Antiviral medications with known therapeutic effects on CMV such as ganciclovir (GCV)/valine (VAL), FOS, Cidofovir, CMX-001, maribavir; acyclovir has no known therapeutic efficacy against CMV and is allowable as standard of care to prevent herpes simplex virus (HSV)\n* Prophylactic therapy with CMV immunoglobulin or prophylactic antiviral CMV treatment; intravenous immunoglobulin therapy (IVIG) is allowed\n* Other investigational product-concurrent enrollment in other clinical trials using any investigational new drug (IND) drugs with unknown effects on CMV or with unknown toxicity profiles is prohibited\n* Other medications that might interfere with the evaluation of the investigational product\n* Patients with congenital immune deficiency\n* Patients with active autoimmune conditions requiring systemic immunosuppressive therapy within the previous 5 years are not eligible, the exception to this is patients with aplastic anemia, who are eligible\n* Pregnant women and women who are lactating; CMV-MVA Triplex risks to pregnant women are unknown; because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with the administered vaccine, also breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is enrolled on this study\n* Any other condition that would, in the investigator's judgment, contraindicate the patient's participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns or compliance with clinical study procedures, e.g., social/psychological issues, etc\n* Prospective participants who, in the opinion of the investigator, may not be able to comply with all study procedures (including compliance issue related to feasibility/logistics)",
