    "inclusion_criteria": "* Pathologically or histologically documented solid tumor.\n* Locally advanced or relapsed/refractory disease or unresectable metastatic disease.\n* HER2-positive disease based on the following local testing:\n\n  * Colorectal cancer: IHC3+, IHC2+/ISH+, NGS amplification by tissue (no RAS or BRAF mutation allowed)\n  * Breast cancer: IHC3+ or IHC2+/ISH+ by tissue\n  * Gastric cancer: IHC3+ or IHC2+/ISH+ by tissue\n  * Other cancers: IHC3+, IHC2+/ISH+, NGS amplification by tissue or ctDNA\n* Prior therapies for Part 1 (Dose Escalation ELVN-002 + trastuzumab):\n\n  * Colorectal cancer: treated with prior fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, irinotecan-based regimens, anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) treatment (if clinically indicated), anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment (if clinically indicated), and an anti-programmed death ligand 1 (PD-(L)-1) treatment (if the tumor is microsatellite instability (MSI)-high/deficient mismatch repair (dMMR)\n  * Breast cancer: treated with prior taxane, pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) if available and appropriate based on local standard of care and investigator's assessment\n  * Gastric cancer: treated with trastuzumab/platinum fluorouracil containing regimen and T-DXd.\n  * Other cancers: progressed during or after ≥ 1 prior line of systemic therapy for locally advanced unresectable or metastatic disease\n  * Prior HER2 targeted therapy is allowed\n* Prior therapies for Part 2 (Phase 1a Dose Escalation ELVN-002 + trastuzumab + chemotherapy):\n\n  * Colorectal cancer: candidate for CAPEOX (capecitabine and oxaliplatin) or mFOLFOX6 (5-FU, LCV and oxaliplatin), and treated, if clinically indicated, with an anti-programmed death ligand 1 (PD-(L)-1) treatment (if the tumor is microsatellite instability (MSI)-high/deficient mismatch repair (dMMR). Prior HER2 targeted therapy is allowed.\n  * Breast cancer: candidate for capecitabine, paclitaxel or eribulin, and treated with prior taxane, pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and T-DXd, if available and appropriate, based on local standard of care and investigator's assessment. No prior HER2 targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy (antibody-drug conjugates and antibodies are allowed), no prior capecitabine (for the capecitabine cohort), no prior eribulin (for the eribulin cohort), and no taxane as immediate prior therapy (paclitaxel cohort).\n* Prior therapies for Part 3 (Phase 1b Dose Expansion ELVN-002 + trastuzumab):\n\n  * Colorectal cancer: treated with prior fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, irinotecan-based regimens, anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) treatment (if clinically indicated), anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment (if clinically indicated), and an anti-programmed death ligand 1 (PD-(L)-1) treatment if the tumor is microsatellite instability (MSI)-high/deficient mismatch repair (dMMR). No prior HER2 targeted therapy.\n  * Breast cancer: treated with prior taxane, pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and T-DXd if available and appropriate based on local standard of care and investigator's assessment. No prior HER2 targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy (antibody-drug conjugates and antibodies are allowed).\n  * Gastric cancer: treated with prior trastuzumab/platinum fluorouracil containing regimen and T-DXd. No prior HER2 targeted therapy.\n  * Other cancers: Progressed during or after ≥ 1 prior line of systemic therapy for locally advanced unresectable or metastatic disease. No prior HER2 targeted therapy.\n* Prior therapies for Part 4 (Phase 1b Dose Expansion ELVN-002 + trastuzumab + chemotherapy):\n\n  * Colorectal cancer: candidate for CAPEOX or mFOLFOX6 and not a candidate for first-line anti-programmed death ligand 1 (PD-(L)-1) treatment (if the tumor is microsatellite instability (MSI)-high/deficient mismatch repair (dMMR). No prior therapy for metastatic disease (1 cycle of mFOLFOX6 or 1 cycle of CAPEOX allowed). No prior HER2 targeted therapy.\n* At least 1 measurable lesion based on RECIST v 1.1 within 6 weeks before the first dose of ELVN-002 (Part 3 and Part 4 only; Phase 1b Dose Expansion cohorts)\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1\n* Adequate hematological, hepatic, renal, and cardiac function\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Treatment with anticancer therapy within a specific time before the first dose:\n\n  * Chemotherapy (including ADC) ≤ 3 weeks\n  * Immunotherapy ≤ 4 weeks\n  * Hormonal therapy ≤ 2 weeks\n  * TKI ≤ 2 weeks\n  * Any experimental therapy ≤ 3 weeks or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer\n  * Radiotherapy-wide therapy ≤ 3 weeks\n  * Radiotherapy limited field (including stereotactic brain) ≤ 2 weeks\n  * Antibody ≤ 3 weeks\n* Any brain lesion requiring immediate local therapy\n* Ongoing use of corticosteroids for central nervous system (CNS) symptoms at a dose of > 2 mg daily of dexamethasone (or equivalent)\n* Leptomeningeal disease\n* Uncontrolled seizures\n* Participants for any chemotherapy cohort: ongoing Grade 2 or higher neuropathy of any cause\n* Inability to swallow pills or any significant gastrointestinal disease that would preclude adequate oral absorption of medications.\n* Ongoing adverse effects from prior treatment > CTCAE Grade 1 except for Grade 2 alopecia\n* Corrected QT interval (QTc) of >470 milliseconds (ms) for females or >450 ms for males",
