    "official_title": "A Phase 2 Study of MEDI4736 (Durvalumab) and Tremelimumab Alone or in Combination With High or Low-Dose Radiation in Metastatic Colorectal and NSCLC",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed non-small cell lung cancer (cohort 1) or colorectal cancer (cohort 2)\n* Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for non-nodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as >= 20 mm (>= 2 cm) with conventional techniques or as >= 10 mm (>= 1.5 cm) with spiral computed tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or calipers by clinical exam\n* Patients in both cohorts must have progressive disease following prior therapy; specifically:\n\n  * Cohort 1 (NSCLC): Patients must have evidence of radiologic or clinical disease progression during previous treatment with systemic PD-1 directed therapy and/or have been deemed not to derive clinical benefit from PD-1 directed treatment; this includes patients who demonstrated an initial response and subsequent progression; no prior treatment with chemotherapy or targeted agents are required; intervening therapy is allowed between previous PD-1 directed treatment and there is no required interval from prior PD-1 treatment required; PD-1 directed treatment includes treatment with antibodies targeting the PD-1 receptor such as pembrolizumab or nivolumab, as well as PD-L1 targeted antibodies such as MEDI4736 (durvalumab), atezolizumab and avelumab; these agents may have been administered as part of a clinical trial\n  * Cohort 2 (colorectal cancer): Patients must have progressed on >= one-line chemotherapy\n* At least 21 days must have elapsed from prior systemic therapy (chemotherapy or radiation)\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =< 1 (Karnofsky >= 60%) and life expectancy greater than 6 months; furthermore, enrollment of patients with greater than 10 measurable lesions is discouraged\n* Patients must have normal organ and marrow function independent of transfusion for at least 7 days prior to screening and independent of growth factor support for at least 14 days prior to screening\n* Hemoglobin (Hgb) >= 9 g/dl\n* Absolute neutrophil count >= 1,500/mcL\n* Platelets >= 100,000/mcL\n* Total bilirubin =< 1.5 x normal institutional limits; this will not apply to patients with confirmed Gilbert's syndrome (persistent or recurrent hyperbilirubinemia [predominantly unconjugated bilirubin] in the absence of evidence of hemolysis or hepatic pathology), who will be allowed in consultation with their physician\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT]) = < 2.5 x institutional upper limit of normal; for patients with hepatic metastases, ALT and AST =< 5 x ULT\n* Measured creatinine clearance (CL) > 40 mL/min OR calculated creatinine clearance (CL) > 40 mL/min as determined by Cockcroft-Gault (using actual body weight)\n* Patients must have at least one lesion that has not previously been irradiated (and is not within a previously radiated field) and for which palliative radiation is potentially indicated and could be safely delivered at the radiation doses specified in this protocol; this lesion must not be the only measurable lesion so that it is still possible to determine the response rate outside of the radiation treatment field; this lesion must not be within the central nervous system (CNS) (brain or spinal cord) or requiring urgent or emergent palliative radiation given the timing of radiation specified on this protocol; furthermore, this lesion:\n\n  * For cohort 1 (NSCLC cohort) - the lesion to be irradiated must be in the lung, lymph nodes, adrenal gland or liver\n  * For cohort 2 (colorectal cohort) - the lesion to be irradiated must be in the liver\n* The effects of MEDI4736 and tremelimumab on the developing human fetus are unknown; for this reason and because radiation is known to be teratogenic, evidence of post-menopausal status or negative urinary or serum pregnancy test for female pre-menopausal patients is required; women will be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrheic for 12 months without an alternative medical cause; the following age-specific requirements apply:\n\n  * Women < 50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal treatments and if they have luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone levels in the post-menopausal range for the institution or underwent surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy)\n  * Women >= 50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments, had radiation-induced oophorectomy with last menses > 1 year ago, had chemotherapy-induced menopause with > 1 year interval since last menses, or underwent surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy)\n* Females of childbearing potential who are sexually active with a non sterilized male partner must use at least 1 highly effective method of contraception from the time of screening and must agree to continue using such precautions for 180 days after the last dose of durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy or 90 days after the last dose of durvalumab monotherapy; non-sterilized male partners of a female patient must use male condom plus spermicide throughout this period; cessation of birth control after this point should be discussed with a responsible physician; not engaging in sexual activity for the total duration of the drug treatment and the drug washout period is an acceptable practice; however, periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of birth control; female patients should also refrain from breastfeeding throughout this period\n* Non-sterilized males who are sexually active with a female partner of childbearing potential must use a male condom plus spermicide from screening through 180 days after receipt of the final dose of durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy or 90 days after receipt of the final dose of durvalumab monotherapy; not engaging in sexual activity is an acceptable practice; however, occasional abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of contraception; male patients should refrain from sperm donation throughout this period\n* Female partners (of childbearing potential) of male patients must also use a highly effective method of contraception throughout this period\n* Highly effective methods of contraception, defined as one that results in a low failure rate (ie, less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly are described in the table below; note that some contraception methods are not considered highly effective (e.g. male or female condom with or without spermicide; female cap, diaphragm, or sponge with or without spermicide; non-copper containing intrauterine device; progestogen-only oral hormonal contraceptive pills where inhibition of ovulation is not the primary mode of action [excluding Cerazette/desogestrel which is considered highly effective]; and triphasic combined oral contraceptive pills)\n\n  * Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately\n* Ability of a patient or a Legally Authorized Representative (LAR) to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document\n* Body weight > 30 kg\n* Must have a life expectancy of at least 12 weeks\n* Cohort 1 (NSCLC cohort)\n\n  * Ability to undergo a fresh tumor biopsy for the purpose of screening for this clinical trial (including able and willing to give valid written consent) to ability or to provide an available archival tumor sample taken less than 3 months prior to study enrollment (and not obtained prior to progression on a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor) if a fresh tumor biopsy is not feasible with an acceptable clinical risk; tumor lesions used for fresh biopsies should be the same lesions to be irradiated when possible and should not be the same lesions used as Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) target lesions, unless there are no other lesions accessible; additional, optional archival tumor tissue is also requested from before the prior PD-1 directed therapy\n* Cohort 2 (colorectal cohort)\n\n  * Ability to undergo a fresh tumor biopsy for the purpose of screening for this clinical trial (including able and willing to give valid written consent) to ability or to provide an available archival tumor sample taken less than 3 months prior to study enrollment if a fresh tumor biopsy is not feasible with an acceptable clinical risk; tumor lesions used for fresh biopsies should be the same lesions to be irradiated when possible and should not be the same lesions used as RECIST target lesions, unless there are no other lesions accessible\n  * Microsatellite stable (MSS) tumor as documented by either:\n\n    * Immunohistochemistry (IHC) testing that does not suggest loss of MLH-1, MSH-2, PMS2 or MSH6\n    * Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing that does not suggest microsatellite instability (MSI)\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
