    "inclusion_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria\n\n* Histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate at initial biopsy, without neuroendocrine differentiation, signet cell, or small cell features.\n* Prostate cancer initially treated by radical prostatectomy (RP) or radiotherapy (XRT) (including brachytherapy) or both (eg, salvage radiotherapy), with curative intent.\n* PSA doubling time ≤ 12 months.\n* Participants must have biochemically recurrent disease after definitive treatment to prostate by either RP or XRT.\n* Screening PSA by the local laboratory ≥ 0.2 ng/mL for participants who had RP (with or without XRT) as primary treatment for prostate cancer or at least 2 ng/mL above the nadir (local assessments) for participants who had XRT or brachytherapy only as primary treatment for prostate cancer.\n* Serum testosterone ≥ 150 ng/dL (5.2 nmol/L).\n* Participants must have undergone a 68Ga-PSMA-11 or a piflufolastat F18 PET scan during or within 3 months of screening.\n\nExclusion Criteria\n\n* Present evidence of metastatic disease in conventional CT scan and/or bone scan\n* Participants that present prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-positive lesions in the 68Ga-PSMA-11 or the piflufolastat F18 positron emission tomography (PET) scan may be enrolled if the conventional imaging does not show suspicion of metastatic disease.\n* Prior hormonal therapy, exceptions include:\n\n  * Neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy to treat prostate cancer ≤ 36 months in duration and ≥ 9 months before enrollment, or\n  * A single dose or a short course (≤ 6 months) of hormonal therapy given for rising PSA ≥ 9 months before enrollment.\n* Prior cytotoxic chemotherapy, aminoglutethimide, ketoconazole, abiraterone acetate, enzalutamide, apalutamide, or darolutamide for prostate cancer.\n* Abiraterone acetate, enzalutamide, apalutamide, or darolutamide are allowed if administered in a neoadjuvant/adjuvant setting ≤ 36 months in duration and ≥ 9 months before enrollment.\n* Prior systemic biologic therapy, including immunotherapy, for prostate cancer.\n* If, in the investigator's opinion, salvage therapy is the preferred intervention.\n* Confirmed history or current autoimmune disease or other diseases resulting in permanent immunosuppression or requiring permanent immunosuppressive therapy.\n* Participant with symptoms and/or clinical signs and/or radiographic signs that indicate an acute and/or uncontrolled active systemic infection within 7 days prior to the first dose of study treatment.\n* Requirement for chronic systemic corticosteroid therapy (prednisone dose > 10 mg/day or equivalent) or any other immunosuppressive therapies (including anti tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNFα] therapies).\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be MALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
