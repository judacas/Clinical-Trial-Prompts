Renal function: Serum creatinine must be < 1.2 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) according to age.

Recipients > 18 years of age must have the ability to give informed consent according to applicable regulatory and local institutional requirements. Legal guardian permission must be obtained for recipients < 18 years of age.

Enrollment in the NMDP protocol: Protocol for a Research Database for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Other Cellular Therapies and Marrow Toxicity Injuries.\n\nRecipient Exclusion Criteria\n\nRecipients meeting any of the following criteria are not eligible for participation in the study:\n\n1. Recipients with radiologically-detected CNS chloromas or CNS 3 disease (presence of ≥ 5/μL white blood cells (WBCs) in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and cytospin positive for blasts [in the absence of a traumatic lumbar puncture] and/or clinical signs of CNS leukemia such as a cranial nerve palsy from active disease). Recipients with adequately treated CNS leukemia are eligible;\n2. Hyperleukocytosis (≥ 50,000 blasts/μL) or rapidly progressive disease that in the estimation of the investigator and sponsor would compromise ability to complete study therapy;\n3. Pregnancy (negative serum or urine pregnancy test must be obtained at time of enrollment for females of childbearing potential and to be repeated 72 hours prior to lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimen);\n4. Breast feeding;\n5. Sexually active female recipients of childbearing potential and male recipients who are of childbearing potential and are unwilling to practice birth control at time of enrollment and for four months after receiving the lymphodepletion preparative regimen;\n6. Active or uncontrolled viral, bacterial or fungal infection. May be receiving ongoing therapy for controlled infection\n7. Recent prior therapy:\n\n   1. At treatment enrollment:\n\n      Patients may be on lower-intensity chemotherapy (e.g., TKIs, venetoclax, hydroxyurea, azacytidine, decitabine or similar agents) at the time of enrollment to prevent disease progression. There is no timing restriction of intrathecal chemotherapy for enrollment.\n   2. Prior to apheresis: The following wash-out periods apply prior to apheresis\n\n      * Systemic chemotherapy ≤ 14 days with the exception of:\n\n        * Hydroxyurea: 1 day\n        * Azacytidine/decitabine and/or venetoclax: 7 days\n      * Intrathecal chemotherapy > 3 days\n      * Tyrosine kinase inhibitors: 3 half-lives or 7 days, whichever is shorter (See Appendix XVIII)\n      * Checkpoint inhibitors or antibody-based therapies: 3 half-lives\n      * Investigational anti-neoplastic agents: 28 days\n      * Clofarabine or nitrosureas: 42 days\n      * Steroid therapy: Not allowed unless at or below physiologic doses (eg, hydrocortisone replacement for prior adrenal insufficiency)\n      * Radiation therapy: Radiation therapy (including CNS) must have been completed at least 21 days prior to apheresis with the exception of no time restriction if the volume of bone marrow treated is less than 10% and also the recipient has measurable/evaluable disease outside the radiation field.\n      * CAR T-cell therapy: Excluded unless at least 30 days from prior CAR T-cell infusion and without detectable circulating CAR T-cells **Please see protocol section 2.5.1 for guidance on wash-out parameters prior to initiation of LD chemotherapy\n8.
