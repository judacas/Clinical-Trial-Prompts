Patients < 18 years of age will be included in the Phase 2 cohorts only after the RP2D/MTD has been estimated in the Phase 1 portion\n* All patients for both Parts A and B must have a minimum body surface area (BSA) >= 0.74 m^2\n* All patients for both Parts A and B must have the ability to swallow BAY 1895344 (elimusertib) tablets intact\n* Patients with recurrent or refractory solid tumors. Patients must have had histologic verification of malignancy at original diagnosis or relapse\n* Part A: Any (non-CNS primary) solid tumor diagnosis including lymphoma which meets one of the following criteria:\n\n  * Any Ewing Sarcoma (histological confirmation alone is adequate) or any EWS-fusion positive solid tumor (i.e. including related Ewing's family of tumors with EWS fusions such as EWS-WT1, EWS-ATF1, etc.)\n  * Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS) with the PAX3-FOXO1 fusion. This does not include PAX7-FOXO1 or other variant fusion ARMS. Please note that a FISH showing FOXO1 breakapart is NOT sufficient for eligibility onto this cohort since it cannot distinguish between FOXO1 partners\n  * Any (non-CNS primary) solid tumor including lymphoma with inactivating alterations of any of the DNA Damage Repair (DDR) genes: ATM, ATRX, BRCA1, BRCA2, CDK12, CHEK1, CHEK2, FANCA, MSH2, MRE11, PALB2, PARP1, POLD1, RAD51, or XRCC2\n* Part B: Any (non-CNS primary) solid tumor diagnosis including lymphoma which meets one of the following criteria:\n\n  * B1, EWS Cohort:\n\n    * Any Ewing Sarcoma (histological confirmation alone is adequate) or any EWS-fusion positive solid tumor (i.e. including related Ewing's family of tumors with EWS fusions such as EWS-WT1, EWS-ATF1, etc.)\n  * B2, PAX3-FOXO1 ARMS Cohort:\n\n    * Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS) with the PAX3-FOXO1 fusion. This does not include PAX7-FOXO1 or other variant fusion ARMS. Please note that a FISH showing FOXO1 breakapart is NOT sufficient for eligibility onto this cohort since it cannot distinguish between FOXO1 partners\n  * B3, DDR Non-statistical Cohort:\n\n    * Any (non-CNS primary) solid tumor including lymphoma with inactivating alterations of any of the DNA Damage Repair (DDR) genes: ATM, ATRX, BRCA1, BRCA2, CDK12, CHEK1, CHEK2, FANCA, MSH2, MRE11, PALB2, PARP1, POLD1, RAD51, or XRCC2\n* All the genes on the DDR panel are annotated with OncoKB, a precision oncology knowledge base which is publicly available here: https://www.oncokb.org/. Alterations which are categorized either 'Oncogenic' or 'Likely Oncogenic' would be considered sufficient for eligibility on either the phase 1 or phase 2 portions of this study. Alterations which are not annotated in OncoKB will need to be reviewed with locally qualified experts in molecular pathology, such as via an established molecular tumor board, in order to determine the likely oncogenicity AND will require approval by the study chair, Dr. Michael Ortiz. If such experts are not available at any institution, the study chair will review\n* In cases where multiple mutations are present or multiple samples are available, either at different locations or different points in time, the presence of a single qualifying genomic alteration in any of those samples will is considered sufficient for eligibility on the phase 2 portions of this study\n* Qualifying aberrations must be detected in either DNA or ribonucleic acid (RNA) in any tumor tissue sample (i.e. detection of a variant on circulating tumor DNA/RNA is not sufficient to qualify) using a somatic (and/or germline) mutational testing approach with either a targeted panel or whole exome/genome sequencing in the context of a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified laboratory setting.

These patients will not be evaluable for hematologic toxicity. At least 5 of every cohort of 6 patients must be evaluable for hematologic toxicity for the dose-escalation part of the study. If dose-limiting hematologic toxicity is observed, all subsequent patients enrolled must be evaluable for hematologic toxicity\n* Serum creatinine clearance or radioisotope glomerular filtration rate (GFR) >= 70 mL/min/1.73 m^2 or a creatinine based on age/gender as follows:\n\n  * Age: 1 to < 2 years; Maximum serum creatinine (mg/dL): 0.6 (male); 0.6 (female)\n  * Age: 2 to < 6 years; Maximum serum creatinine (mg/dL): 0.8 (male); 0.8 (female)\n  * Age: 6 to < 10 years; Maximum serum creatinine (mg/dL): 1 (male); 1 (female)\n  * Age: 10 to < 13 years; Maximum serum creatinine (mg/dL): 1.2 (male); 1.2 (female)\n  * Age: 13 to < 16 years; Maximum serum creatinine (mg/dL): 1.5 (male); 1.4 (female)\n  * Age: >= 16 years; Maximum serum creatinine (mg/dL): 1.7 (male); 1.4 (female)\n* Bilirubin (sum of conjugated + unconjugated or total) =< 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) for age\n* Serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) (alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) =< 135 U/L.
