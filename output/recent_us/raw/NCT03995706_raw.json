Morphologically confirmed diagnosis of a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) based on 2016 WHO classification (Arber et al 2016) by investigator assessment with one of the following Prognostic Risk Categories, based on the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R):\n\n   * Very high\n   * High\n   * Intermediate with at least ≥ 5% bone marrow blast\n4. Not eligible at the time of screening, for intensive chemotherapy according to the investigator, based on local standard medical practice and institutional guidelines for treatment decisions\n5. Not eligible at the time of screening, for hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) according to the investigator, based on local standard medical practice and institutional guidelines for treatment decisions.\n6.

    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Prior exposure to TIM-3 directed therapy at any time. Prior therapy with immune check point inhibitors (e.g. anti-CTLA4, anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2), cancer vaccines are allowed except if the drug was administered within 4 months prior to randomization.\n2. Previous first-line treatment for higher risk MDS with chemotherapy or any other antineoplastic agents including lenalidomide and hypomethylating agent (HMAs) such as decitabine or azacitidine.\n3. History of severe hypersensitivity reactions to any ingredient of the study treatment (azacitidine, decitabine or MGB453) or their excipients, or to monoclonal antibodies (mAbs).\n4. Currently using or used within 14 days prior to randomization of systemic, steroid therapy (> 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent) or any immunosuppressive therapy. Topical, inhaled, nasal, ophthalmic steroids are allowed. Replacement therapy, steroids given in the context of a transfusion are allowed and not considered a form of systemic treatment.\n5. Investigational treatment for MDS received within 4 weeks prior to randomization. In case of a checkpoint inhibitor: 4 months minimum prior to randomization interval is necessary to allow enrollment.\n6. Active autoimmune disease requiring systemic therapy (e.g.corticosteroids).\n7. Live vaccine administered within 30 Days prior to randomization.\n\nOther protocol-defined Inclusion/Exclusion may apply.",
