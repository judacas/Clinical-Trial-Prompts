Re-evaluation with additional imaging or testing may be required\n\nBenefit over risk should be assessed and reassessed throughout the treatment course. Successive lifileucel components (preparative lymphodepleting chemotherapy, LN-144/LN-145 and IL-2 ) should be withheld or discontinued if at any time during the treatment course, at the discretion of the treating physician, benefit may not be justified by risks to the patient\n\nSubsequent delays of lymphodepletion up to 14 days due to logistical issues such as production of lifileucel and/or major weather events will not constitute protocol violations and out of window assessments will not need to be repeated unless there is a change in clinical status.",
