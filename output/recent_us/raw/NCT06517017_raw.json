No Legally Authorized Representative can provide initial consent.\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\n* More than one prior disease relapse (WHO grade 3-4) or more than two prior disease relapses (WHO grade 2) for Phase II only. For Phase I enrollment, there are no limits on the number of prior recurrences.\n* Prior therapy with:\n\n  * any investigational agent (including IDH mutant inhibitor) and/or standard of care cytotoxic therapy within 28 days prior to treatment initiation\n  * vincristine within 14 days prior to treatment initiation\n  * nitrosoureas within 42 days prior to treatment initiation\n  * procarbazine within 21 days prior to treatment initiation\n  * non-cytotoxic agents, e.g., interferon, tamoxifen, thalidomide, cis-retinoic acid, within 7 days prior to treatment initiation\n  * surgery within 14 days prior to treatment initiation\n  * radiation therapy within 30 days prior to treatment initiation\n  * bevacizumab for tumor treatment. Note: participants who received bevacizumab for symptom management, including but not limited to cerebral edema, or pseudo progression can be enrolled\n* Prolonged QTc >470ms as calculated by correction formula on screening electrocardiogram (ECG) (QTCf can be used; QTCb can be used for participants with sinus bradycardia) )\n* Prior invasive malignancies within the past 3 years prior to study treatment initiation (with the exception of non-melanoma skin cancers, carcinoma in situ of the cervix, melanoma in situ, or any localized cancer for whom the systemic standard of care therapy is not required)\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical composition to zotiraciclib, such as flavopiridol\n* Pregnancy (confirmed with beta-HCG serum or urine pregnancy test performed at screening)\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness or social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements\n* Uncontrolled primary diabetes mellitus\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 15 Years",
