    "exclusion_criteria": "Participants who meet any of the following criteria will be disqualified from entering the study:\n\n* Prior treatment with orlotamab, enoblituzumab, or other B7-H3 targeted agents, including I-DXd.\n* Prior discontinuation of an antibody drug conjugate (ADC) that consists of an exatecan derivative (eg, trastuzumab deruxtecan) due to treatment-related toxicities.\n* Clinically active brain metastases, spinal cord compression or leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, defined as untreated or symptomatic, or requiring therapy with steroids or anticonvulsants to control associated symptoms.\n* Any of the following conditions within the past 6 months: cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic attack, or another arterial thromboembolic event.\n* Clinically significant corneal disease.\n* Uncontrolled or significant cardiovascular disease.\n* History of (non-infectious) interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis that required corticosteroids, current ILD/pneumonitis, or suspected ILD/pneumonitis that cannot be ruled out by imaging at screening.\n* Clinically severe pulmonary compromise resulting from intercurrent pulmonary illnesses,\n* Chronic steroid treatment (dose of 10 mg daily or more prednisone equivalent), except for low-dose inhaled steroids (for asthma/COPD) or topical steroids (for mild skin conditions) or intra-articular steroid injections.\n* History of malignancy other than SCLC within the 3 years prior to enrollment, except adequately resected non-melanoma skin cancer, curatively treated in situ disease, superficial gastrointestinal (GI) tract tumors and non-muscle invasive bladder cancer curatively resected by endoscopic surgery.\n* History of allogeneic bone marrow, stem cell, or solid organ transplant.\n* Unresolved toxicities from previous anticancer therapy, defined as toxicities (other than alopecia) not yet resolved to National Cancer Institute- Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 5.0 (NCI-CTCAE V5.0), Grade ≤1 or baseline.\n* History of hypersensitivity to the drug substances, inactive ingredients in the drug product or severe hypersensitivity reactions to other monoclonal antibodies.\n* Evidence of ongoing uncontrolled systemic bacterial, fungal, or viral infection.\n* Has active or uncontrolled hepatitis B or C infection.\n* Active, known, or suspected autoimmune disease.\n* Any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic diseases (including active bleeding diatheses, psychiatric illness/social situations, substance abuse).\n* Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug.\n* Female who is pregnant or breast-feeding or intends to become pregnant during the study.\n* Prior or ongoing clinically relevant illness, medical condition, surgical history, physical finding, or laboratory abnormality that, in the investigator's opinion, could affect the safety of the participant.\n* Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection that is not well controlled.",
