    "official_title": "A Phase 2 Study of TL118 for the Treatment of Patients With Solid Tumors Harboring NTRK Gene Fusions",
    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Age 18 years old and above, male or female\n2. Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of locally advanced or metastatic solid tumor that harbors an NTRK1/2/3 gene fusion that is predicted to translate into a fusion protein with a functional tropomyosin receptor kinase (TRK)A/B/C kinase domain, without a concomitant second onco-driver\n3. Patients must have had disease progression during or after prior treatment for their tumor, or would be unlikely to tolerate or derive clinical benefit from appropriate standard of care therapy or are not suitable - in the opinion of the Investigator - to receive standard of care therapy; prior treatment with approved or investigational TRK inhibitors is not allowed, except for prior TRK treatment for less than 28 days due to intolerable toxicity)\n4. At least one measurable lesion\n5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score of 0, 1, or 2\n6. A minimum life expectancy of > 3 months\n7. Adequate bone marrow reserve, hepatic, renal, and coagulation function\n\nOther inclusion criteria apply for participating in the Study\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Any systemic anti-tumor therapy such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy (including curative radiotherapy or spinal radiotherapy portion > 30%) used within 3 weeks prior to enrollment; immunotherapy within 4 weeks; any palliative radiotherapy for non-target lesions used to relieve symptoms and traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) indicated for the tumor (including Chinese patent medicine) within 2 weeks prior to enrollment\n2. Participation in another interventional clinical trial 2 weeks prior to enrollment or within 5 half-lives from the last dose of IP (whichever is shorter)\n3. Any unresolved toxicities from prior therapy greater than Grade 1, at the time of screening with the exception of toxicities posing no safety risk in the opinion of the Investigator\n4. Active central nervous system metastases\n5. Any other primary malignant tumors within 3 years (except for cured skin basal cell carcinoma and carcinoma in situ of cervix, low-risk cancer\n6. Any active infection which has not been controlled at screening\n\nOther exclusion criteria apply for participating in the Study",
