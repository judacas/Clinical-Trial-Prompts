    "official_title": "A Phase III, Randomized, Double-blind, Multicenter, Global Study of Rilvegostomig or Pembrolizumab in Combination With Platinum-based Chemotherapy for the First-line Treatment of Patients With Metastatic Non-squamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Whose Tumors Express PD-L1 (ARTEMIDE-Lung03)",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Histologically or cytologically documented non-squamous NSCLC.\n* Stage IV mNSCLC (based on the American Joint Committee on Cancer Edition 8) not amenable to curative treatment.\n* Absence of sensitizing EGFR mutations (including, but not limited to, exon 19 deletion and exon 21 L858R, exon 21 L861Q, exon 18 G719X, and exon 20 S768I mutations) and ALK and ROS1 rearrangements.\n* Absence of documented tumor genomic mutation results from tests conducted as part of standard local practice in any other actionable driver oncogenes for which there are locally approved targeted 1L therapies.\n* Provision of acceptable tumor sample, to confirm tumor PD-L1 expression TC ≥ 1%.\n* At least one lesion not previously irradiated that qualifies as a RECIST 1.1 TL at baseline and can be accurately measured at baseline as ≥ 10 mm in the longest diameter (except lymph nodes, which must have short axis ≥ 15 mm) with CT or MRI and is suitable for accurate repeated measurements.\n* Adequate organ and bone marrow function\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Presence of small cell and neuroendocrine histology components.\n* Brain metastases unless asymptomatic, stable, and not requiring steroids or anticonvulsants for at least 4 weeks prior to start of study intervention. A minimum of 2 weeks must have elapsed between the end of brain radiotherapy and study enrollment. Participants must have recovered from the acute toxic effect of radiotherapy (eg, dizziness and signs of increased intracranial pressure).\n* Any prior systemic therapy received for advanced or mNSCLC. Prior systemic therapy in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting and/or definitive radio- or chemoradiotherapy for early-stage disease are allowed, provided that recurrence or progression has occurred > 12 months after the end of treatment.\n* Any prior exposure to an anti-TIGIT therapy or any other anticancer therapy targeting immune-regulatory receptors or mechanisms.\n* Any prior treatment with an anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 agent.\n* History of another primary malignancy except for malignancy treated with curative intent with no known active disease ≥ 2 years before the first dose of study intervention and of low potential risk for recurrence.\n* Active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders requiring chronic treatment with steroids or other immunosuppressive treatment.\n* Active primary immunodeficiency/active infectious disease(s).\n* Active tuberculosis infection.",
