In addition, females < 55 years-of-age must have a serum follicle stimulating (FSH) level > 40 mIU/mL to confirm menopause). Note: Documentation may include review of medical records, medical examinations, or medical history interview by study site.\n* Women of child-bearing potential and men with partners of child-bearing potential must agree to practice sexual abstinence or to use two forms of adequate contraception (hormonal AND barrier method of birth control) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation and for 6 months following completion of therapy.\n* Men of child-bearing potential must not father a child or donate sperm while on this study and for 6 months after the last study treatment.\n* Adequate organ function\n* Negative HIV test at screening, with the following exception: patients with a positive HIV test at screening are eligible provided they are stable on anti-retroviral therapy, have a CD4 count >200/uL, and have an undetectable viral load. They must agree to continue on such anti-retroviral therapy per local standard treatment guideline\n* Negative HBV and HCV tests at screening, with the following exception:\n\n  * For HBV: DNA must be < 500 IU/mL (or must be < 2500 copy/mL if copy/mL is the only unit available in the study site; if the normal ranges of the study sites are different, the positive standard must not be met), and have received anti-HBV therapy for at least 14 days prior to the first dose of study treatment (treatment in accordance with local standard of care, e.g., entecavir) and are willing to receive antiviral therapy throughout the study if indicated;\n  * For HCV (with positive HCV RNA): must receive anti-viral therapy in accordance with the local standard treatment guideline and hepatic function resolve to CTCAE Grade ≤1\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\n* Simultaneously enrolled in any therapeutic clinical trial\n* Current or anticipating use of other investigational agents while participating in this study\n* Treatment with investigational therapy within 28 days prior to initiation of study treatment\n* Diagnosed with a psychiatric illness or is in a social situation that would limit compliance with study requirements\n* Active Grade 3 (per the NCI CTCAE, Version 5.0) or higher viral, bacterial, or fungal infection within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment\n* Patients harboring targetable mutations (e.g., EGFR, ALK and BRAF, etc.) who have not had at least one frontline targeted therapy fail, or have received other systemic therapies (e.g. chemotherapy, immunotherapy, etc.)\n* Patients with carcinomatous meningitis (leptomeningeal metastasis)\n* Undergone major surgery within 2 weeks prior to the start of study regimen, or has not achieved complete wound healing\n* Presence of another cancer with disease manifestations or therapy that could adversely affect participant safety or longevity, create the potential for drug-drug interactions, or compromise the interpretation of study results. Otherwise, patients can be considered eligible, for example, locally curable cancers that have been apparently cured, such as basal or squamous cell skin cancer, superficial bladder cancer, or carcinoma in situ of the prostate, cervix, or breast.\n* Prior treatment with cabozantinib and/or atezolizumab.\n* Receipt of any type of small molecule kinase inhibitor (including investigational kinase inhibitor) within 2 weeks before first dose of study treatment.\n* Receipt of any type of cytotoxic, biologic or other systemic anticancer therapy (including investigational) within 4 weeks before first dose of study treatment\n* Radiation therapy within 4 weeks before first dose of study treatment. Systemic treatment with radionuclides within 6 weeks before first dose of study treatment. Participants with clinically relevant ongoing complications from prior radiation therapy are not eligible.\n* Known brain metastases or cranial epidural disease unless adequately treated with radiotherapy and/or surgery (including radiosurgery) and stable for at least 4 weeks prior to first dose of study treatment after radiotherapy or at least 4 weeks prior to first dose of study treatment after major surgery (e.g., removal or biopsy of brain metastasis). Participants must have complete wound healing from major surgery or minor surgery before first dose of study treatment. Eligible participants must be neurologically asymptomatic and with corticosteroid no more than 10mg prednisone or equivalent at the time of first dose of study treatment.\n* Concomitant anticoagulation with coumarin agents (e.g., warfarin), direct thrombin inhibitors (e.g., dabigatran), direct factor Xa inhibitor betrixaban, or platelet inhibitors (e.g., clopidogrel). Allowed anticoagulants are the following:\n\n  * Prophylactic use of low-dose aspirin for cardio-protection (per local applicable guidelines) and low-dose low molecular weight heparins (LMWH).\n  * Therapeutic doses of LMWH or anticoagulation with direct factor Xa inhibitors such as rivaroxaban, edoxaban, or apixaban in participants without known brain metastases who are on a stable dose of the anticoagulant for at least 1 week before first dose of study treatment without clinically significant hemorrhagic complications from the anticoagulation regimen or the tumor.\n* Live, attenuated vaccines (e.g., FluMist) are prohibited within 4 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment, during treatment with atezolizumab, and for 5 months after the last dose of atezolizumab.\n* The participant has uncontrolled, significant cardiovascular disorders\n* Clinically significant hematuria, hematemesis, or hemoptysis of > 0.5 teaspoon (2.5 ml) of red blood, or other history of significant bleeding (e.g., pulmonary hemorrhage) within 12 weeks before first dose of study treatment\n* Lesions invading or encasing any major blood vessels.\n* Other clinically significant disorders that would preclude safe study participation\n* Major surgery (e.g., laparoscopic nephrectomy, GI surgery, removal or biopsy of brain metastasis) within 2 weeks before first dose of study treatment.
