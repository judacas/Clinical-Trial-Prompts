Exceptions to this exclusion include the following: 1) malignancies that were treated curatively, which have not recurred within 3 years prior to study entry and do not require further treatment; 2) completely resected basal and squamous cell skin cancers; 3) any malignancy considered to be indolent and that has never required anticancer therapy; and 4) completely resected carcinoma in situ of any type.\n* History of severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions to BH3 mimetics (including venetoclax) or to any excipients of S227928.\n* Any previous anticancer treatment for the studied disease within 2 weeks or at least 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to first dose of IMPs (except for hydroxycarbamide). In case of investigational biologic agents with a long half-life, such as immune checkpoint or bispecific antibodies, a flat wash-out period of 28 days will be acceptable. Participation in non-interventional registries or epidemiological studies is allowed. Hormonal therapies are not considered anticancer treatments for eligibility purposes.\n* Any cellular therapies (e.g., NK or CAR T cells) within 100 days prior to first dose of IMP.\n* Any radiotherapy within 2 weeks before the first dose of IMPs (except for palliative radiotherapy to localized lesions, i.e., chloromas).\n* Any drugs known to prolong the QT interval and induce Torsade de pointes (TdP) within 7 days prior to the first administration of IMP.\n* Dose Escalation Arm A ONLY: Although participants may be treated with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 or of CYP2C8, they may not be treated with medications that are strong inhibitors of both CYP3A4 and CYP2C8, or with separate medications that when combined would cause strong inhibition of these two enzymes. In addition, participants may not be treated with a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 and a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C8 and/or a moderate inhibitor of P-gp. These prohibitions begin 7 days prior to the start of IMP and continue for the entire duration of treatment. Triazole antifungal agents may be used, but only if they are in agreement with the criteria described above (i.e., they must not be dual strong inhibitors of both CYP3A4 and CYP2C8 or strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 and moderate inhibitors of either CYP2C8 or P-gp).\n* Dose Escalation Arm B and Dose Expansion ONLY: a malabsorption syndrome or other condition that precludes enteral route of administration.\n* Dose Escalation Arm B and Dose Expansion ONLY: Both moderate and strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 are prohibited, beginning 7 days prior to the start of IMP and continuing for the entire duration of treatment.\n* Dose Escalation Arm B and Dose Expansion ONLY: Both moderate and strong CYP3A4 inducers are prohibited, beginning 14 days before the start of IMP and continuing for the entire duration of treatment.\n* Dose Escalation Arm B and Dose Expansion ONLY: treatment with P-gp and BCRP inhibitors; or with medications with a narrow therapeutic index (NTIs) which are substrates of P-gp or BCRP; or with OATP1B1 substrates that cannot be discontinued 7 days before and during study treatment",
