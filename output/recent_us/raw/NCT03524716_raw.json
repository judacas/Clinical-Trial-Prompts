Individuals diagnosed with synchronous ovarian and endometrial cancer primaries may be included if the initial endometrial cancer was stage I.\n* Survivors who have completed primary treatment (surgery and chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone for a new diagnosis ovarian/peritoneal/fallopian tube cancer within the last 5 years). Date of completion of primary treatment is defined as within approximately 60 days after the last chemotherapy infusion. Maintenance therapy infusions do not count in determining date of completion of primary therapy. Women who were not recommended to receive adjuvant chemotherapy (for example, in the case of certain stage IA/IB cancers) are eligible after surgery alone. Women receiving consolidation or maintenance therapy following primary chemotherapy or following treatment for first recurrence are eligible.\n* Survivors must not have had more than one recurrence. Those who have had one recurrence will be eligible if they have completed active therapy for their recurrence.\n* Although most women meeting the above criteria will be in remission, complete clinical remission (normal tumor markers and normal CT scan) is not a requirement for eligibility. Even women with low-level disease after completion of cytotoxic chemotherapy who do not meet the strict definition of remission may have stable disease and may not require additional cytotoxic chemotherapy for a prolonged period of time, particularly if they are on maintenance therapy. If subjects recur during the group they will be allowed to continue to participate, as able, even while taking chemotherapy.\n* Survivors must be fluent in spoken English (6th grade level), which is necessary to participate in the intervention.\n* Survivors must be willing to be randomized and followed for 12 months.\n* Survivors must be able to understand and willing to sign a written informed consent document.\n* Survivors currently involved in the STEPS through Ovarian Cancer program will need to wait until their involvement is completed to participate.\n* Survivors receiving active treatment for another cancer may be eligible when their treatment is completed.\n\nTemporary Exclusion:\n\n* Survivors involved in Steps through OC must wait until they have completed that program to participate.\n* Survivors currently involved in a study involving another behavioral intervention or an exercise intervention must wait until the prior study is over to participate.\n* Survivors who score greater than or equal to 24 on the CESD can be rescreened when their depressive symptoms resolve.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be FEMALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 90 Years",
