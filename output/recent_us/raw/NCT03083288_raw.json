However, prior immunotherapy with anti-PD1/PD-L1 plus a CD137 agonist or a CD40 agonist is not allowed.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "Patients who meet any of the following criteria will be not eligible for the study:\n\n* Any treatment specifically for systemic tumor control given within 3 weeks before the initiation of therapy; within 2 weeks if cytotoxic agents were given weekly, within 6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C; within 5 half-lives for targeted agents with half-lives and pharmacodynamic effects lasting < 5 days; or failure to recover from toxic effects of any previous therapy.
