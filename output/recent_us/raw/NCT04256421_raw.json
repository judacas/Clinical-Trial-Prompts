    "inclusion_criteria": "Registration Inclusion Criteria\n\n* Participant is considered a suitable candidate for HCT and has an acceptable source of allogeneic donor stem cells, as defined per institutional practice (allogeneic HCT for any donor source [matched sibling, unrelated donor (URD), mismatched URD, related haploidentical, or umbilical cord blood] and any graft source [umbilical cord, BM, peripheral blood (PB)], and any conditioning [myeloablative conditioning (MAC), reduced intensity conditioning (RIC), or non-myeloablative conditioning (NMA)] will be permitted).\n* Participant is considered a legal adult by local regulation at the time of signing informed consent form (ICF).\n* Participant consents to allow access to diagnostic BM aspirate or PB sample and/or the DNA derived from that sample, if available, that may be used to validate a companion diagnostic that is being developed in parallel with gilteritinib.\n* Participant has confirmed, morphologically documented AML in CR1.

Incomplete platelet recovery (CRp) is defined as CR with platelet count < 100 x 109/L. Incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) is defined as CR with residual neutropenia < 1 x 109/L with or without complete platelet recovery.

If not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be used.)\n  * Male is sterile due to a bilateral orchiectomy\n* Male participants must not donate sperm throughout the study drug treatment period and for 127 days after the final study drug administration.\n* Participant is able to take an oral medication.\n* Participant agrees not to participate in another interventional study while on treatment.\n\nRandomization Inclusion Criteria\n\n* Participant is ≥ 30 days and ≤ 90 days from hematopoietic cell infusion.\n* Participant has achieved engraftment.

The participant must not have had a platelet transfusion within 7 days prior to the first measurement.\n* Participant has confirmed ongoing morphologically documented AML in CR1. For the purposes of randomization, CR1 will be defined as < 5% blasts with no morphologic characteristics of acute leukemia (e.g., Auer Rods) in the BM with no evidence of extramedullary disease such as central nervous system involvement or granulocytic sarcoma.\n* Participant meets the following criteria as indicated on the clinical laboratory tests:\n\n  * Serum creatinine within normal range, or if serum creatinine outside normal range, then GFR > 40 mL/min/1.73m2 as calculated with the Cockcroft-Gault equation with adjustment if total body weight is ≥ 125% of ideal body weight.\n  * TBL < 2.5 mg/dL, except for participants with Gilbert's syndrome.\n  * Serum AST and/or ALT < 3 x institutional ULN.\n  * Serum potassium and magnesium ≥ the institutional lower limit of normal (LLN).\n* If the participant has developed overall grades II-IV acute GVHD, the following criteria must be met to be randomized:\n\n  * No requirement of > 0.5 mg/kg of prednisone (or equivalent) daily dose within 1 week of randomization\n  * No escalation of systemic immunosuppression in terms of increase of corticosteroids or addition of new agent / modality within 2 weeks of randomization.
