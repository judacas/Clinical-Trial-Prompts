    "official_title": "A Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind Phase 3 Study of HBI-8000 Combined With Nivolumab Versus Placebo With Nivolumab in Patients With Unresectable or Metastatic Melanoma Not Previously Treated With PD-1 or PD-L1 Inhibitors",
    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Histopathologically confirmed diagnosis of non-uveal, Stage III (unresectable), or Stage IV (metastatic) melanoma according to AJCC staging system (8th edition).\n2. Known BRAF V600 mutation status or consent to BRAF V600 mutation testing before randomization.\n3. Tumor tissue available for PD-L1 testing at central lab or local laboratory; results must be obtained prior to randomization. In the event when archived tumor tissue is not available, new tumor biopsy or historical PD-L1 test results may be used for randomization, however tumor tissue, either taken previously or newly acquired, must be provided for central biomarker confirmation for final data analyses.\n\n   PD-L1 expression level is required for randomization. In order to be randomized, a patient must be classified as PD-L1 positive or PD-L1 negative according to the following criteria:\n   * PD-L1 positive (≥ 1% tumor cell membrane staining in a minimum of a hundred evaluable tumor cells) vs\n   * PD-L1 negative (< 1% tumor cell membrane staining in a minimum of a hundred evaluable tumor cells).\n\n   Note: If an insufficient amount of tumor tissue is available prior to the start of the screening phase, patients must consent to allow the acquisition of additional tumor tissue for performance of biomarker analyses.\n4. Males or females 12 years of age or older.\n5. ECOG performance status ≤1 for age ≥18 years, Lansky performance status ≥80% for age 12 to 17 years.\n6. At least one measurable lesion defined by RECIST 1.1 criteria, (separate from the lesion to be used for tumor tissue collection) not counting brain metastasis with:\n\n   * Longest diameter ≥10 mm by CT (when slice thickness is ≤5 mm); or ≥ 2× slice thickness (when slice thickness is >5 mm)\n   * Pathologically enlarged lymph node: ≥15 mm in short axis by CT (when slice thickness is ≤5 mm)\n   * Clinical: ≥10 mm (that can be accurately measured with calipers).\n7. Have not received anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1 or other systemic therapy for unresectable or metastatic melanoma, except for the following, provided that the patient has recovered from all treatment-related toxicities:\n\n   * BRAF mutation targeting therapy > 4 weeks before administration of Study Treatment.\n   * Adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy with PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors or anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (anti-CTLA-4) is allowed if disease progression/or recurrence had occurred at least 6 months after the last dose of neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy and prior to receiving the first dose on this study and no clinically significant immune related toxicities leading to treatment discontinuation were observed\n   * Adjuvant interferon therapy must have been completed > 6 weeks before administration of Study Treatment\n8. Any prior radiotherapy or minor surgery must be completed at least 2 weeks and 1 week respectively before Day 1 dosing and recovered from all treatment related toxicities\n9. Screening laboratory results within 14 days prior to randomization:\n\n   * Hematology: WBC ≥3000/μL, neutrophils ≥1500/μL, platelets ≥100 × 103/μL, hemoglobin ≥10.0 g/dL independent of transfusion. The use of erythropoietic growth factor to achieve hemoglobin (Hgb) ≥ 10 g/dl is acceptable.\n   * The CrCL≥ 30 mL/min using Cockcroft-Gault formula.\n   * AST and ALT ≤3 × ULN, alkaline phosphatase ≤2.5 × ULN unless bone metastases present (patients with documented bone metastases: alkaline phosphatase <5 x ULN), bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × ULN (unless known Gilbert's disease where it must be ≤ 3 × ULN), serum albumin ≥ 3.0 g/dL).\n10. Negative serum pregnancy test at baseline for women of childbearing potential.\n11. Females of childbearing potential (non-surgically sterile or premenopausal female capable of becoming pregnant) and all males (due to potential risk of drug exposure through the ejaculate) must agree to use adequate birth control measures from study start, during the study and for 5 months after the last dose of Study Drug. Acceptable methods of birth control in this trial include two highly effective methods of birth control (as determined by the Investigator; one of the methods must be a barrier technique) or abstinence.\n12. Have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document, comply with study scheduled treatment, visits and assessments.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 12 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. History of ≥ Grade 3 hypersensitivity reactions to monoclonal antibodies.\n2.
