    "exclusion_criteria": "* Medical contraindication to receipt of radiotherapy\n* Severe active co-morbid systemic illnesses or other severe concurrent disease which, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study or interfere significantly with the proper assessment of safety and toxicity of the prescribed regimens\n* Uncontrolled concurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements or providing informed consent\n* Active systemic lupus or scleroderma\n* Women of childbearing potential who are sexually active and not willing/able to use medically acceptable forms of contraception\n* Prior receipt of external beam radiation to the current active disease site or if additional radiotherapy to the current site would be unsafe as determined by the treating radiation oncologist\n* More than 3 LIRADS-5 lesions or disease extent such that organ at risk constraints cannot be met\n* Tumor extension into common or main branch biliary duct or adjacent organs including stomach, small or large bowel\n* Extrahepatic metastases or lymph node involvement\n* History of other malignancies (except for in situ cancers treated only by local excision and basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin) within 1 year prior to study entry\n* Patient is unable to undergo intravenous contrast enhanced liver imaging (either computed tomography [CT] or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) based on clinical imaging protocols established at the treating institution",
