    "inclusion_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria\n\n* Recurrent or progressive advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer (no small cell component) with most recent treatment being an FDA approved immune checkpoint inhibitor (pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, or nivolumab) NOTE: Pathology reports documenting the diagnosis of NSCLC are required to be reviewed to confirm outside diagnosis\n* Sufficient tumor tissue available from original diagnosis or subsequent biopsy for analysis of estrogen receptor and aromatase - tumor block or a minimum of 5 unstained slides\n* Failed at least 1 prior FDA approved treatment for advanced NSCLC. Patients with EGFR/ALK/ROS1 rearrangements should have received an FDA-approved TKI prior to enrollment on this trial.\n* Measureable disease by RECIST version 1.1\n* Post-menopausal defined as\n\n  * Age ≥ 55 years and 1 year or more of amenorrhea\n  * Age < 55 years and 1 year or more of amenorrhea with an estradiol assay < 20 pg/mL\n  * Surgical menopause with bilateral oophorectomy\n* ECOG performance status 0, 1 or 2\n\n  * Life expectancy of 3 months or more in the opinion of the enrolling investigator and documented in the medical record\n* Adequate organ function within 14 days of study enrollment defined as:\n\n  * Hematology:\n\n    ** Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1500/mm³, Platelets ≥ 100,000/mm³, Hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL\n  * Biochemistry:\n\n    * Total Bilirubin within normal institutional limits\n    * AST/SGOT and ALT/SGPT ≤ 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN), except if there is known hepatic metastasis, wherein transaminases may be ≤ 5 x institutional ULN.\n    * Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dl or glomerular filtration rate > 50 ml/min\n* Must have recovered to CTCAE v 4 Grade 1 or better from the acute effects of any prior surgery, chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Chronic residual toxicity (i.e. peripheral neuropathy) is permitted.\n* A minimum time period must elapse between the end of a previous treatment and start of study therapy:\n\n  * 1 week from the completion of radiation therapy for brain metastases\n  * 4 weeks from the completion of chemotherapy or any experimental therapy\n  * 4 weeks from prior major surgery (such as open biopsy or significant traumatic injury)\n* Voluntary written consent before any research related procedures or therapy\n\nExclusion Criteria\n\n* Known active CNS disease - If patient has history of brain metastases, the brain lesions must have been treated with radiation and/or surgery - patients should be neurologically stable and requiring ≤10mg oral prednisone equivalence of steroids per day\n* Any toxicity from immune-related toxicity from prior immune therapy that would preclude further treatment with anti-PD-1/PDL-1 inhibitor or ongoing IR toxicity ≥ Grade 2\n* Requiring > 10 mg prednisone equivalence of steroids per day for immune-related toxicity\n* Inability or unwilling to swallow study drug\n* Any gastrointestinal condition causing malabsorption or obstruction (eg, celiac sprue, gastric bypass surgery, strictures, adhesions, history of small bowel resection, blind loop syndrome)\n* Currently using hormone replacement therapy (oral or patch) or/and phytoestrogen supplements (i.e. black cohosh)\n* Known hypersensitivity to exemestane or its excipients\n* Any serious underlying medical condition that, in the opinion of the enrolling physician, would impair the ability of the patient to receive protocol treatment\n* Prior malignancy, with the exception of curatively treated squamous cell or basal carcinoma of the skin or in situ cervical cancer, unless there is a 3-year disease-free interval\n* Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers such as rifampicin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, or St. John's wort as these may significantly reduce the availability of exemestane\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be FEMALE",
