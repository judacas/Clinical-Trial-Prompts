    "official_title": "Feasibility of 18F-Fluciclovine PET/CT to Identify Brain Metastasis",
    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Patients with clinically suspected or diagnosed brain metastatic lesion(s)\n2. Age â‰¥ 18 years\n3. Known history cancer\n4. Brain MRI in the past 2 months positive for metastatic disease\n5. Scheduled for treatment: Surgical resection, or stereotactic radiosurgery, or whole brain radiation therapy.\n6. Can tolerate 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT exam (can lie still on their back for the duration of the scan)\n7. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 99 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Patients who do not meeting inclusion criteria.\n2. Patients who have had a brain biopsy of the index lesion(s) sooner than 4 weeks from the brain 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT (to minimize false positive uptake due to inflammation).\n3. Patients who have had prior brain surgery or radiation treatment of the index lesion(s).\n4. Patients who have had treatment of the index brain lesion(s) or initiation of systemic therapy after the last MRI and prior to the PET/CT scan.\n5. Prior history of localized brain treatment (surgery or stereotactic radiosurgery /fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy) allowed, if at least one index lesion is not adjacent to previous treatment (10% isodose line of prior RT). Patients with only index lesion(s) within 10% isodose line of prior treatment would be excluded. For example, if ALL index lesions are within the 2.2Gy isodose line of previously treated lesions to 22Gy in 1 fractions, the patient would be ineligible, however if there is 1 index lesion not in the prior radiation field, then that patient would be eligible but all other lesions in prior radiation fields would be excluded from analysis.\n6. Inability to tolerate 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT exam\n7. Enrollment delays patient care\n8. Concurrent or prior enrollment on other clinical trials would not exclude patients, as long as all other eligibility criteria are met.",
