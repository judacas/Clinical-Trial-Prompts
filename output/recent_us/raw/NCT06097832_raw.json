Any history of chronic or autoimmune pancreatitis.\n8. Known history of or any evidence of active, non-infectious pneumonitis.\n9. Current use of medications specified by the protocol as prohibited for administration in combination with study drug.\n\n   1.

Inhaled or topical steroids and adrenal replacement doses > 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease.\n   3. Corticosteroids administered as pre-medication for IV contrast allergy are also allowed.\n10. Received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the start of study drug.\n\n    1.
