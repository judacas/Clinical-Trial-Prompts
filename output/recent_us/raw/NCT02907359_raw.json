    "official_title": "A Multi-center, Randomized, Placebo-controlled Trial of S-Adenosylmethionine (SAMe) in Patients with Alcoholic Cirrhosis",
    "inclusion_criteria": "Inclusion criteria for patients with alcoholic cirrhosis\n\n1. Evidence of cirrhosis as per clinical signs and/or noninvasive transient elastography (FibroscanÂ®), computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging including MRI elastography compatible with cirrhosis and/or histopathology by biopsy and\n2. subjects with clinical presentation either in Child Class A or B at the time of enrollment\n3. individuals 18 to 70 years old and may or may not consume alcohol during study.\n\nInclusion criteria for healthy control :\n\n) individuals 18 to 70 years old (2) able to provide informed consent (3) subjects do not consume any alcohol or those who drink < 50 grams per day on average in women and < 80 grams per day on average in men (4) subjects are healthy without underlying acute or chronic medical conditions.\n\nExclusion criteria for patients with alcoholic cirrhosis\n\n1. Active infection as evidenced by positive urine culture, blood culture, or pneumonia,\n2. Known co-existing infection with hepatitis C, hepatitis B, or HIV\n3. Significant systemic or major illness including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, and renal failure that in the opinion of the Investigator would preclude the patient from participating in and completing the study\n4. Gastrointestinal bleeding within the prior 28 days3\n5. Participation in another investigational drug, biologic, or medical device trial within 30 days prior to screening\n6. Women who are pregnant, may become pregnant, or nursing\n7. Presence of any other disease or condition that is interfering with the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of SAMe such as those with gastric bypass surgery\n8. Subjects with history of/diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma\n9. Members from the same family of study participant. This is based on the recent paper on the non-random sampling in randomized controlled trials4. We acknowledge that if we assign family members to identical treatment, randomization would not be totally correct; but if properly randomized, there is a chance that the members of the family might mix the pills. To avoid this issue and maintain the integrity of randomized blinded fashion, we will not include members from the same family into the study\n10. Subjects with psychiatric illnesses such as bipolar disorders as SAMe may interfere with the levels of anti-psychotic drugs and\n11. Subjects who are immunocompromised\n\nExclusion criteria for all healthy control participants:\n\n1. subjects with an active and serious medical disease\n2. subjects with an infectious disease\n3. consume any alcohol within 3 months before the study\n4. subjects with localized or systemic infection\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 70 Years",
