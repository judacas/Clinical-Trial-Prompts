    "inclusion_criteria": "* Patients with relapsed or primary refractory AML, including:\n\n  * Patients with relapsed AML (Any patient in first or subsequent relapse are eligible. Patients with relapse after HSCT are eligible)\n  * Primary refractory AML defined as failure to achieve a complete response after 2 cycles of induction chemotherapy, including persistent MRD positivity\n  * Patients with isolated CNS or extramedullary disease are eligible Note: a response monitoring plan must be developed a priori for subjects with extramedullary disease\n* Patient age 1-24.99 years old\n* Negative serum test to rule out pregnancy within 2 weeks prior to enrollment in females of childbearing potential\n\n  o Sexually active males and females of childbearing potential must agree to use a form of contraception considered effective and medically acceptable by the Investigator for 6 months after the last dose of chemotherapy and/or NK cell infusion\n* Negative serology for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\n* Both males and females and members of all races and ethnic groups are eligible\n* Organ function requirements:\n\n  * Renal function: Creatinine ≤ 2 mg/dl OR creatinine clearance > 60 ml/min/1.73m2.\n  * Liver function: Total bilirubin ≤ 2 mg/dl (unless Gilbert's syndrome), AST and ALT ≤ 5 times the upper limit of normal (unless related to leukemic involvement). Upper limit of normal should be determined by the institutional defined normal laboratory range.\n  * Cardiac function: left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 40% or shortening fraction ≥20%. May be eligible after cardiology clearance if qualitatively normal function or repeat measures are normal.\n  * CNS: Patients with seizure disorder may be eligible if seizures well controlled\n* All prior treatment related non-hematologic toxicities must have resolved to ≤ Grade 2 prior to enrollment unless granted approval by study PI and/or Co-Is.\n* All patients and/or their legal guardians must be able to understand and willing to sign a written informed consent document\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 1 Year\nMust have maximum age of 24 Years",
