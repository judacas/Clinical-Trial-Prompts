    "official_title": "Phase I Trial of Phenformin With Patients With Combination BRAF Inhibitor/MEK Inhibitor in Patients With BRAFV600E/K-mutated Melanoma",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* AJCC (2009) stage IV melanoma, or stage III melanoma not curable by surgery and which is progressing or in patients whom neo-adjuvant treatment is deemed acceptable. Patients must have at least 1 target lesion measurable by RECIST 1.1 criteria.\n* The melanoma must harbor an activating BRAF V600 mutation. Prior therapy with a BRAF and/or MEK inhibitor is allowed in the dose-escalation phase only. However, patients who discontinued previous RAF inhibitor due to intolerance of the drug rather than due to progression will not be eligible.\n* Histologic proof of melanoma reviewed and confirmed by the treating institution. The melanoma must have a documented BRAFV600E or BRAFV600K mutation by genotyping or IHC12 performed by a CLIA certified laboratory. At MSK, the Diagnostic Molecular Pathology laboratory has developed and implemented a targeted capture-based next-generation DNA sequencing assay, MSK-IMPACTTM, to profile all protein-coding exons and selected introns from 410 oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissues (Cheng, D.T., et al., J Mol Diagn, 2015. 17(3): p. 251-64). MSK-IMPACTTM has been approved by the NY State Department of Health to be run as a clinical assay in the CLIA-compliant Diagnostic Molecular Pathology laboratory. MSK-IMPACTTM is capable of detecting mutations, copy number alterations, and structural variations. BRAF Exon15 was captured by the MSK-IMPACTTM panel and the c.1799T>A (p.V600E) mutation was fully validated as per NYS requirements. Detailed results of the validation of this mutation were included in the validation package submitted to NY State Department of Health.\n* At MGH, samples will be tested using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology called Anchored Multiplex PCR (AMP) for single nucleotide variant (SNV) and insertion/deletion (indel) detection in genomic DNA using next generation sequencing (NGS). Briefly, genomic DNA was isolated from a formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tumor specimen is sheared with the Covaris M220 instrument, followed by end-repair, adenylation, and ligation with an adapter. A sequencing library targeting hotspots and exons in 39 genes (including BRAF, exons 11 and 15) is generated using two hemi-nested PCR reactions. Illumina MiSeq 2 x 147 base paired-end sequencing results are aligned to the hg19 human genome reference using BWA-MEM (Li H and Durbin R. Bioinformatics 2009;25(14):1754-60). MuTect (Cibulskis K, et al. Nat Biotechnol 2013;31(3):213-9) and a laboratory-developed insertion/deletion analysis algorithm are used for SNV and indel variant detection, respectively. This assay has been validated to detect SNV and indel variants at 5% allelic frequency or higher in target regions with sufficient read coverage. This test was developed, and its performance characteristics were determined by the MGH Center for Integrated Diagnostics.\n* Patients must be adequately recovered from surgery, radiation therapy, or any surgical complications prior to enrollment.\n* Age ≥ 18 years old.\n* ECOG performance status of 0-2.\n* The ability to swallow pills and otherwise follow the protocol.\n* Patients with treated CNS metastases will be eligible if not symptomatic the CNS disease has been stable for a minium of 6 weeks and the patient requires less than or equal to the equivalent of 2 mg/day of dexamethasone.\n* Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:\n\n  * Absolute Neutrophil Count ≥1.5 K/mcL\n  * Platelets ≥100 K/mcL\n  * Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL\n  * Total Bilirubin ≤ 1.2 X institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) or ≤ 3.0 X institutional ULN if the patient has Gilbert's Syndrome\n  * AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) ≤ 1.2 X institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)\n  * Creatinine ≤ 1.4 mg/dl\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Type I or Type II diabetes\n* A history of renal failure (unless recovered for at least 6 months), lactic acidosis, recurrent or severe hypoglycemia, or significant chronic obstructive lung disease. Patients will not be excluded for reversible episodes of elevated creatinine due to hypovolemia.\n* Acute or chronic liver or renal disease.\n* Concurrent use of hypoglycemic agents or any systemic therapy for melanoma. Palliative limited-field radiation therapy will be allowed\n* Current use of a prohibited medication.\n* Vemurafenib\n\n  * Avoid inducers and inhibitors of CYP3A4\n  * Careful with drugs metabolized by CTP1A2 (Clozapam, olanzapine, fluvoxamine, haloperidol, theophylline, caffeine).\n* Encorafenib\n\n  * Avoid inducers and inhibitors of CYP3A4\n  * Avoid drugs that increase QTc interval\n* Dabrafenib\n\n  * Avoid inducers and inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2CA8 (Refer to Appendix C for specific drugs).\n* Presence of conditions that will interfere significantly with the absorption of drugs.\n* A history of known glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency.\n* Pregnant and/or lactating women\n* A prior or concurrent metastatic second malignancy within 3 years, even if it does not require active therapy. For example, patients with concomitant indolent B-cell malignancies will not be eligible. Patients with a prior resected in-situ or stage I malignancy felt to be cured will be eligible.\n* Other uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. New York Heart Association class ≥2 will be an exclusion criterion.\n* QTc interval > 500 msec unless a bundle branch block is also present.\n* Patients with brain metastases unless they meet the criteria of section 6.1.8.\n* Patients currently receiving other anti-melanoma treatment. Toxicities attributable to any prior therapy must have resolved to grade 1 or better prior to enrollment. Grade 2 endocrinopathies, except diabetes, that are ongoing from prior immunotherapy will not exclude the patient as long as the patient is on appropriate replacement doses of hormone.\n* Patients receiving steroid treatment exceeding replacement dosing\n* In the dose expansion phase of the trial, prior treatment with a BRAF inhibitor will be an exclusion criterion. This includes prior adjuvant dabrafenib/trametinib.\n\nInclusion of Women and Minorities:\n\n* Both men and women, and members of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this trial.",
