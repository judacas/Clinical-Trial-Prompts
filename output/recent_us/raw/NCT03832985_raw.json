NSCLC is exceedingly rare in patients < 18 years of age. Because no dosing or adverse event (AE) data are currently available on the use of telaglenastat (CB-839) HCl in combination with osimertinib (AZD9291) in patients < 18 years of age, children are excluded from this study\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =< 2 (Karnofsky >= 60%)\n* Must be able to swallow pills\n* Life expectancy > 3 months\n* Leukocytes >= 3,000/mcL\n* Absolute neutrophil count >= 1,500/mcL\n* Platelets >= 100,000/mcL\n* Hemoglobin >= 90 g/L\n* Total bilirubin =< 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) and up to 3 mg/dL for patients with Gilbert's disease\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT]) =< 2.5 x institutional ULN and =< 5 x institutional ULN for patients with liver metastases\n* Creatinine within 1.5 x ULN OR\n* Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) >= 50 mL/min/1.73 m^2 (measured or calculated by Cockcroft and Gault equation) - confirmation of creatinine clearance is only required for patients with creatinine levels above institutional upper limit of normal\n* Should participants with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection be included, patients are only eligible if they meet all the following criteria:\n\n  * Demonstrated absence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infection or history of HCV co-infection\n  * Demonstrated absence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection\n  * Participants with active HBV infection are eligible if they are:\n\n    * Receiving anti-viral treatment for at least 6 weeks prior to study treatment, HBV DNA is suppressed to <100 IU/mL and transaminase levels are below ULN. Participants with a resolved or chronic infection HBV are eligible if they are:\n\n      * Negative for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and positive for hepatitis B core antibody [anti-HBc IgG]. In addition, patients must be receiving anti-viral prophylaxis for 2-4 weeks prior to study treatment and 6-12 months (To be determined [TBD] by hepatologist) post treatment OR\n      * Positive for HBsAg, but for > 6 months have had transaminases levels below ULN and HBV DNA levels below <100 IU/mL (i.e., are in an inactive carrier state). In addition, patients must be receiving anti-viral prophylaxis for 2-4 weeks prior to study treatment and 6-12 months (TBD by hepatologist) post treatment\n* If history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, must be treated and have an undetectable HCV viral load\n* Patients with treated brain metastases are eligible if follow-up brain imaging after central nervous system (CNS) - directed therapy shows no evidence of progression\n* Patients with new or progressive brain metastases (active brain metastases) or leptomeningeal disease are eligible if the treating physician determines that immediate CNS specific treatment is not required and is unlikely to be required during the first cycle of therapy. Patients on corticosteroids for the treatment of brain metastases will be permitted as long as the dose is =< 10 mg of prednisone-equivalent and has not been increased within 2 weeks of screening\n* Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen are eligible for this trial\n* Patients with known history or current symptoms of cardiac disease, or history of treatment with cardiotoxic agents, should have a clinical risk assessment of cardiac function using the New York Heart Association Functional Classification. To be eligible for this trial, patients should be class 2B or better\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. Participants with impaired decision-making capacity (IDMC) who have a legally-authorized representative (LAR) and/or family member available will also be eligible\n* EXPANSION COHORT: Patients must have had progressive disease on prior first line EGFR inhibitor therapy with osimertinib\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Patients who have not recovered from AEs due to prior systemic anti-cancer therapy (i.e., have residual toxicities > grade 1), with the exception of alopecia.

Patients who have received prior immunotherapy may be included only if time from last immunotherapy is at least 3 months (i.e. 90 days)\n* Spinal cord compression, symptomatic and unstable brain metastases except for those patients who have completed definitive therapy, and have had a stable neurological status for at least 2 weeks after completion of definitive therapy. Patients may be on corticosteroids (=< 10 mg of prednisone-equivalent) to control brain metastases if they have been on a stable dose for 2 weeks (14 days) prior to the start of study treatment and are clinically asymptomatic\n* Patients with an uncontrolled intercurrent illness\n* Patients with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to telaglenastat (CB-839) HCl, osimertinib (AZD9291), or other agents used in study. Patients with hypersensitivity to to any of the inactive excipients thereof should also be excluded\n* Currently receiving (or unable to stop use prior to receiving the first dose of study treatment) medications or herbal supplements known to be potent inducers of CYP3A4 (wash-out periods vary). All patients must try to avoid concomitant use of any medications, herbal supplements and/or ingestion of foods with known inducer effects on CYP3A4\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because telaglenastat (CB-839) HCl is a glutaminase inhibitor with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for AEs in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with telaglenastat (CB-839) HCl and osimertinib (AZD9291), breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with telaglenastat (CB-839) HCl and osimertinib (AZD9291). Breastfeeding patients will be excluded.
