    "official_title": "Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation of α/β T-Lymphocyte Depleted Graft Conditioned With a Reduced Intensity Regimen in Patients With Hematologic Malignancies and Aplastic Anemia",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Patients with one of the high risk myeloid diseases as outlined below. Patients must have ≤ 5% blasts on the last BM evaluation prior to starting the conditioning regimen. Diseases included on this protocol include:\n\n  1. Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) in CR1 with intermediate or high risk features as defined below:\n\n     °Cytogenetic abnormalities which are not considered \"good risk\" cytogenetic features (i.e t(8:21), t(15:17), inv 16 without c-kit mutations.\n\n     And/or\n     * Therapy related AML with history of antineoplastic therapy (radiation and/or chemotherapy) And/or\n     * Normal karyotype with mutations of FLT3, RUNX1, TP53 mutation, ASXL1 or any others that are considered to be high risk\n  2. AML in ≥ 2nd remission\n  3. Myelodysplastic syndrome, myeloproliferative neoplasms, or MDS/MPN overlap syndrome with:\n\n     °International prognostic scoring system risk score INT-2 or high risk at the time of transplant evaluation.\n\n     And/or\n     * Any risk category if life-threatening cytopenia exists And/or\n     * Karyotype or genomic changes that indicate high risk for progression to acute myelogenous leukemia, including abnormalities of chromosome 7 or 3, mutations of TP53, or complex or monosomal karyotype.\n  4. Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML)\n  5. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) with the following features:\n\n     °Patients who have failed or are intolerant to BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors.\n\n     And/or\n\n     °CML with BCR-ABL mutation consistent with poor response to tyrosine kinase inhibition (e.g T351l mutation)\n  6. Patients with severe aplastic anemia\n* Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with high risk disease as defined by the EBMT consensus criteria.\n* Non-Hodgkin lymphoma meeting both of the following criteria:\n\n  * Responding to therapy prior to enrollment.\n  * Relapse after prior autologous bone marrow transplant or are ineligible for autologous bone marrow transplant.\n* Multiple Myeloma with disease in the following categories:\n\n  * Patients with relapsed multiple myeloma following autologous stem cell transplantation who have achieved at least partial response following additional chemotherapy\n  * Patients with high risk cytogenetics at diagnosis must have achieved at least a partial response following autologous stem cell transplantation. Patients must have complex karyotype, del17p, t4;14, and/or t14;16 by FISH and/or del13 by karyotyping.\n* Each patient must be willing to participate as a research participant and must sign an informed consent form.\n* Organ Function and Performance Status Criteria:\n\n  1. Patients be ≥ 18 years old.\n  2. Patients must have a Karnofsky (adult) or Performance Status ≥ 70%.\n  3. Patients must have adequate organ function measured by:\n\n     * Cardiac: asymptomatic or if symptomatic, then LVEF at rest must be ≥ 40% and must improve with exercise.\n     * Hepatic: < 5x ULN ALT and < 2x ULN total serum bilirubin, unless there is congenital benign hyperbilirubinemia.\n     * Renal: CrCl >30ml/min (measured or calculated/estimated).\n     * Pulmonary: asymptomatic or if symptomatic, DLCO > 50% of predicted (corrected for hemoglobin)\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Prior allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation\n* Prior radiation therapy with 400cGY or more of TBI\n* BM with increased fibrosis (Reticulin stain > 1/3)\n* Active and uncontrolled infection at time of transplantation\n* HIV infection\n* Seropositivity for HTLV-1\n* Inadequate performance status/ organ function\n* Pregnancy or breast feeding\n* Patient or guardian unable to give informed consent or unable to comply with the treatment protocol including appropriate supportive care, follow-up, and research tests.\n\nDonor Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria:\n\n* Must be a 10/10 HLA genotypically match related or unrelated donor at all A, B, C, DRB1, and DQB1 loci, as tested by DNA analysis\n* Able to provide informed consent for the donation process per institutional standards\n* Meet standard criteria for donor collection as defined by the National Marrow Donor Program Guidelines",
