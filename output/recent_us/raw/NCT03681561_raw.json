Acceptable forms of birth control for female patients include: hormonal birth control, intrauterine device, diaphragm with spermicide, condom with spermicide, or abstinence. Female patients who become pregnant or suspect pregnancy must immediately notify their doctor. Females patients who become pregnant will be taken off study. Men who are able to have children must use effective birth control while on the study therapy.\n\n    Acceptable forms of birth control for male patients include: condom with spermicide or abstinence.
