    "official_title": "A Prospective, Multicenter, Randomized Clinical Investigation Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of GATT-Patch Versus TachoSil for Hemostasis During Open Liver Surgery",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Subject is scheduled to undergo elective open surgery on the liver;\n* Subject is willing and able to give written informed consent for the clinical investigation participation;\n* Subjects is 22 years of age or older at the time of enrollment; and\n* Subject has been informed of the nature of the clinical investigation.\n\nA subject must meet all of the following intra-operative inclusion criteria to be enrolled into the clinical investigation:\n\n* Subject in whom the Investigator is able to identify a target bleeding site at the liver resection plane for which any applicable conventional means for hemostasis (e.g. suture, ligature or cautery) are ineffective or impractical, and the choice is made to use a hemostatic agent to stop the bleeding; and\n* Subject has a target bleeding site with a SBSS of 1, 2, or 3 (e.g. reflecting minimal, mild or moderate bleeding severities).\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 22 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* The target bleeding site is from a large defect in an artery or vein that requires vascular reconstruction with maintenance of vessel patency;\n* Subject is scheduled to undergo surgery on other organs than the liver and its associated biliary and vascular system; • Subject is scheduled to undergo a staged liver surgery procedure (e.g., Associating Liver Partition and Portal vein ligation for Staged hepatectomy [ALPPS])\n* Subject is taking multiple antithrombotic therapies in therapeutic dosage up to the time of surgery, but allowing exclusive use of acetylsalicylic acid;\n* Subject has platelet count <100 x 109/L, an activated partial thrombin time of >100s, or international normalized ratio >2.5;\n* Subject has a total bilirubin level of ≥2.5 mg/dl;\n* Subject is pregnant, planning on becoming pregnant or actively breastfeeding during the 3-month follow-up period;\n* Subject has a known hypersensitivity to brilliant blue (FD&C Blue #1), porcine gelatin, or horse proteins;\n* Subject who has religious objections to receiving products with components of animal (porcine or equine) or human origin;\n* Subject has an active or suspected infection at the bleeding site;\n* Subject in whom the investigational device will be used at the site of a synthetic graft or patch implant;\n* Subject has a life expectancy of less than 3 months;\n* Subject has a documented severe congenital or acquired immunodeficiency;\n* Subject has had or has planned to receive any organ transplantation;\n* Subject undergoes surgery with the indication of being a living liver donor;\n* Subject is currently participating or has participated in another clinical investigation within the past 30 days that may affect the endpoints of the study, such as trials related to the surgical procedure, and on anti-coagulation;\n* Subject is not appropriate for inclusion in the clinical investigation, per the medical opinion of the Investigator; and\n* Subject has any incidental (pre- and peri-operative) findings deemed by the Investigator to potentially jeopardize the safety or welfare of the subject.",
