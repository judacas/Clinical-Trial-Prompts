Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,000/μL\n   2. Platelets ≥ 100,000/μL (transfusion independent, defined as not receiving platelet transfusions within a 7-day period prior to enrollment)\n   3. Hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL (may receive PRBC transfusions)\n   4. Total bilirubin < 1.5 times upper limit of normal for age\n   5. AST (SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) < 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal for age\n   6. Creatinine clearance or radioisotope GFR ≥ 70 ml/min/1.73m2 or a serum creatinine WNL for age as determined using the Schwartz formula.36\n   7. Sodium, Potassium, Calcium and Magnesium < 1.5x institutional ULN\n   8. Albumin ≥ 3 g/dL\n4. Subjects who are receiving dexamethasone must be on a stable or decreasing dose for at least 1 week prior to enrollment.\n5. Subjects with neurological deficits should have deficits that are stable for a minimum of 1 week prior to enrollment.\n6. If the subject has any of the following therapies, must be at least:\n\n   * 4 weeks post-focal RT (radiation therapy), 3 months post-CSI (craniospinal irradiation)\n   * 4 weeks post-myelosuppressive chemotherapy (if post-nitrosoureas, must have 6 weeks therapy)\n   * 4 weeks post-monoclonal antibodies\n   * 1 week post-targeted therapy\n7. If subject has received any previous treatment, all treatment related toxicities should have recovered to < grade 2\n8.

Subjects with other factors that increase the risk of QT prolongation or arrhythmic events (e.g., heart failure, hypokalemia, family history of long QT interval syndrome) including heart failure that meets New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II or above.\n7. Subjects who have had an allogenic bone marrow transplant < 6 months prior to enrollment or an autologous bone marrow/stem cell transplant < 3 months prior to enrollment.\n8. Subjects with multifocal disease or disease that has been disseminated will not be eligible for this study. They will undergo systemic chemotherapy and their disease will be further evaluated prior to be eligible for 2nd look surgery.\n9. This study will only enroll subjects with ACPP or CPC and will not enroll subjects with choroid plexus papilloma (CPP). ACPP or CPC subjects with symptomatic hydrocephalus will not be eligible for this study. These subjects will have to be treated for their hydrocephalus and be re-evaluated according to our eligibility criteria in order to be enrolled.",
