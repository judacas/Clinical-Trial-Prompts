    "official_title": "A First-in-Human Study of the Safety, Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics, and Preliminary Antitumor Activity of JNJ-74699157 in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors Harboring the KRAS G12C Mutation",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Kirsten rat sarcoma virus homolog (KRAS) glycine-to-cysteine (G12C) mutation in tumor tissue or blood\n* Histological documentation of disease: Part 1: Histologically or cytologically confirmed solid tumor malignancy that is metastatic or unresectable, Part 2: (a) unresectable, locally advanced (Stage IIIB) or metastatic (Stage IV) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), (b) Solid tumor malignancy other than NSCLC that is metastatic or unresectable\n* Received or was ineligible for standard treatment options. For NSCLC: previously received a platinum-containing chemotherapy regimen and an anti- programmed death-ligand 1 (PD1/PDL1) antibody, unless participant refused or was ineligible to receive such therapy; and for colorectal cancer (CRC): previously received at least 2 prior lines of therapy, including a fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan, unless participant refused or was ineligible to receive such therapy. For Participants in France only: NSCLC: Previously received a platinum-containing chemotherapy regimen and an anti-PD1/PDL1 antibody or was ineligible to receive such therapy. CRC: Previously received at least 2 prior lines of therapy, including a fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan or was ineligible to receive such therapy\n* Measurable or evaluable disease: Part 1: either measurable or evaluable disease, Part 2: At least 1 measurable lesion per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status grade of 0 or 1\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Symptomatic brain metastases or known leptomeningeal disease; asymptomatic brain metastases are allowed if they have been treated, have been stable for greater than or equal to (>=) 4 weeks as documented by radiographic imaging, and do not require prolonged (greater than [>]14 days) systemic corticosteroid therapy. Participants who have had complete surgical resection of or received stereotactic radiosurgery to less than or equal to (<=) 3 metastatic lesions will be permitted to enroll in the study within 14 days of such treatment if they have recovered from treatment, are clinically stable, and do not require prolonged systemic corticosteroid therapy as noted above\n* Prior treatment with an inhibitor specific to KRAS G12C\n* Prior solid organ transplantation\n* History of malignancy (other than the disease under study) within 2 years before the first administration of study drug. Exceptions include squamous and basal cell carcinomas of the skin and carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or malignancy that in the opinion of the investigator, with concurrence with the sponsor's medical monitor, is considered cured with minimal risk of recurrence within 2 years\n* Inability to take an orally administered drug, or medical disorder or prior surgical resection that may affect the absorption of the study drug. Such conditions include, but are not limited to, malabsorption syndrome, symptomatic inflammatory bowel disease, partial or complete bowel obstruction, or resection of the stomach or small bowel. If any of these conditions exist, the investigator should discuss with the sponsor to determine participant eligibility",
