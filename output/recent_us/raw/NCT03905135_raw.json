The three possible cohorts for each regimen expanded to phase 2 enrollment will be: BCG-unresponsive, BCG-relapsing and/or BCG-persistent (combined within a single cohort), and high-risk BCG-naïve. It is not anticipated that all three possible phase 2 expansion cohort populations will be pursued for every regimen entering phase 2 expansion. Questions regarding phase 2 expansion cohort populations and patient eligibility should be directed to the study chair. The individual eligibility for phase 2 expanded cohorts according to BCG exposure history are summarized below.\n\no BCG-unresponsive NMIBC phase 2 expanded cohort. BCG-unresponsive NMIBC is defined by any of the following:\n\n* Persistent or recurrent CIS with or without the presence of concurrent Ta or T1 tumors within 12 months of completion of adequate BCG therapy\n* Recurrent high-grade Ta or T1 tumors within 6 months of completion of adequate BCG therapy.\n\nNOTE: In recognition of the fact that procedure scheduling factors beyond the control of the patient or treating physician may cause unintended delays in disease evaluations, patients with pure high-grade papillary tumors (Ta or T1) with no components of CIS with recurrence documented within 9 months of completion of adequate BCG therapy who meet all other eligibility criteria may be considered for enrollment after consultation with the study chair.\n\n* Persistent T1 high-grade tumors at the first disease evaluation (e.g. 3-month post-treatment evaluation) following an adequate BCG induction course\n* Prostatic urethra involvement of NMIBC o Adequate BCG therapy is defined as at least one of the following:\n* At least 5 of 6 doses of an initial induction BCG course plus at least 2 of 3 doses of maintenance therapy\n* At least 5 of 6 doses of an initial induction BCG course plus at least 2 of 6 doses of a second induction course\n\n  * BCG-relapsing and/or BCG-persistent NMIBC phase 2 expanded Cohort. BCG-relapsing and/or BCG-persistent NMIBC is defined by either of the following:\n\n    • BCG-relapsing NMIBC is defined as recurrent high-risk NMIBC after achievement of a complete response to BCG induction therapy which does not meet any of the BCG-unresponsive criteria outlined in the protocol.\n  * BCG-persistent NMIBC is defined as persistent high-risk NMIBC at the first disease evaluation after initial BCG induction therapy (with no intervening achievement of complete response) for which a second course of BCG induction therapy is considered a standard of care (e.g. CIS or high grade Ta tumors) which does not meet any of the BCG-unresponsive criteria outlined in the protocol.\n  * High-risk BCG-naive NMIBC cohort. High-risk BCG-naive NMIBC is defined as high-risk NMIBC in a patient that has never received intravesical BCG therapy. NOTE: Patients who satisfy the above definition of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC continue to be considered BCG-unresponsive regardless of the receipt of any intervening or additional non-BCG based intravesical therapies (e.g. chemotherapy, non-BCG investigational agents)\n\nPrimary"
