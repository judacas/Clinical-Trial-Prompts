    "exclusion_criteria": "* A woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) who has a positive urine pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to randomization. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required\n* Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent or with an agent directed to another stimulatory or co-inhibitory T-cell receptor (e.g., CTLA-4, OX-40, CD137)\n* Has received prior systemic anti-cancer therapy including investigational agents within 4 weeks prior to randomization\n\n  * Note: Participants must have recovered from all adverse events (AEs) due to previous therapies to =< grade 1 or baseline. Participants with =< grade 2 neuropathy may be eligible\n  * Note: If participant received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting study treatment\n* Has received prior radiotherapy within 2 weeks of start of study treatment.
