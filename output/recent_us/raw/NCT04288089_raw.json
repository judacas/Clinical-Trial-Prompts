Patients must also not breastfeed while on study treatment and for 2 weeks after the last dose of dabrafenib and for 4 months after the last dose of trametinib or cabozantinib.\n\n  * NOTE: Patients of childbearing potential who are on hormonal contraceptives may be at risks because dabrafenib may decrease the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives. An effective non-hormonal contraception should be used during therapy and for 2 weeks following discontinuation of dabrafenib and at least 4 months following the last dose of trametinib and cabozantinib\n* Patient must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. Patients with impaired decision-making capacity (IDMC) who have a legally authorized representative (LAR) or caregiver and/or family member available will also be considered eligible\n* Hemoglobulin (Hgb) ≥ 8 g/dL obtained ≤ 28 days prior to protocol randomization\n* Leukocytes ≥ 3,000/mcL obtained ≤ 28 days prior to protocol randomization\n* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,500/mcL obtained ≤ 28 days prior to protocol randomization\n* Platelets ≥ 100,000/mcL obtained ≤ 28 days prior to protocol randomization\n* Total bilirubin ≤ 2.0 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) obtained ≤ 28 days prior to protocol randomization\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)(serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase [SGPT]) ≤ 3.0 × institutional ULN or < 5.0 x ULN with the presence of hepatic metastasis obtained ≤ 28 days prior to protocol randomization\n* Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m² obtained ≤ 28 days prior to protocol randomization\n* Urine protein/creatinine (UPC) ratio ≥ 1 obtained ≤ 28 days prior to protocol randomization\n* Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients on effective anti-retroviral therapy with undetectable viral load within 6 months of randomization are eligible for this trial\n* For patients with evidence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, the HBV viral load must be undetectable on suppressive therapy, if indicated\n* Patients with a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection must have been treated and cured. For patients with HCV infection who are currently on treatment, they are eligible if they have an undetectable HCV viral load\n* Patients with treated brain metastases are eligible if follow-up brain imaging obtained after central nervous system (CNS)-directed therapy (radiotherapy and/or surgery) shows no evidence of progression. CNS disease must be stable for at least 4 weeks prior to randomization; patients must be neurologically asymptomatic and without corticosteroid treatment at time of randomization\n* Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen are eligible for this trial\n* Patients must have corrected QT interval calculated by the Fridericia formula (QTcF) ≤ 500 ms obtained within 28 days prior to randomization.\n\n  * NOTE: If a single electrocardiogram (ECG) shows a QTcF with an absolute value > 500 ms, two additional ECGs at intervals of approximately 3 minutes (min) must be performed within 30 min after the initial ECG, and the average of these 3 consecutive results for QTcF will be used to determine eligibility\n* Patient must be English or Spanish speaking to be eligible for the quality of life (QOL) component of the study.\n\n  * NOTE: Sites cannot translate the associated QOL forms\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
