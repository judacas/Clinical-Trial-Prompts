    "inclusion_criteria": "* One of the following diagnoses:\n\n  * Histologically or radiographically diagnosed stage I-IIA (AJCC, 8th ed.) non-small cell lung cancer .\n\n    * Clinical AJCC stage I defined as stage 1A1 (T1a1N0M0, T1a tumor less than or equal to 1 cm), stage 1A2 (T1bN0M0, T1b tumor between 1 and 2 cm), and stage 1A3 (T1cN0M0, T1c tumor between 2 and 3 cm).\n    * Clinical AJCC stage IB defined as T2aN0M0, T2a tumor between 3 and 4 cm.\n    * Clinical AJCC stage IIA defined as T2bN0M0, T2b tumor between 4 and 5 cm.\n  * Oligometastatic lung tumor secondary to a primary cancer of any type/histology. Oligometastatic patients may include patients with:\n\n    * 1-5 sites of metastatic disease with at least one lung lesion intended to be treated with SBRT\n    * More than 5 sites of metastatic disease with oligo-progressive disease in the lung intended to be treated with SBRT.\n* Lesions must be small and peripheral.\n\n  * Small is defined as max tumor dimension of 5 cm or less.\n  * Peripheral is defined as greater than 2 cm from the proximal bronchial tree/mediastinum.\n* Tumors and anatomy amenable to one-fraction lung SBRT confirmed by meeting of one-fraction lung SBRT target and constraint metrics on a diagnostic-scan based preplan.\n\n  * Patients who do not meet this criterion will be screen fails and triaged to the standard lung SBRT workflow and treated off trial.\n* Lesions must have a maximum superior to inferior motion of 1 cm on 4D-CT imaging.\n\n  * Patients who do not meet this criteria will be screen fails and triaged to the standard lung SBRT workflow and treated off trial.\n* At least 18 years of age.\n* Able to understand and willing to sign an IRB approved written informed consent.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Past history of radiotherapy within the projected treatment field of any of the disease sites to be treated by ONE STOP SBRT.\n* Pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Patient must have a negative pregnancy test within 14 days of ONE STOP SBRT.",
