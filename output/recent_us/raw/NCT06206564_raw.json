    "inclusion_criteria": "* INCLUSION CRITERIA:\n* High radiological suspicion of hepatocellular carcinoma (LR4 or LR5 based on the most current version of LI-RADS) with at least one measurable lesion on standard imaging modality (CT and/or MRI).\n* Eligible for local therapies (included but not limited to surgical resection, stereotactic radiation therapy, transarterial chem/radio/bland embolization, microwave ablation, radiofrequency ablation).\n* Ability to take oral medication and be willing to adhere to the study intervention regimen.\n* Age >=18 years.\n* ECOG performance status <=2.\n* Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals must be on effective anti-retroviral therapy with undetectable viral load within 6 months.\n* Known chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infected individuals, must be on suppressive therapy with undetectable viral load.\n* Individuals with a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection must have been treated and cured.\n* The effects of 18F-DCFPyL (study drug) on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because this agent as well as other therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for 2 months after each study PET/CT imaging.
