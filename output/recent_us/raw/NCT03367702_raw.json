Be scheduled to receive platinum chemotherapy (specifically oxaliplatin or cisplatin) without other neurotoxic chemotherapy (taxanes, bortezomib, thalidomide).

Have physical limitations (e.g., cardiorespiratory, orthopedic, central nervous system) that contraindicate participation in maximal physiological fitness testing and a low/moderate intensity home-based walking and progressive resistance exercise program.\n3. Have planned surgery or radiation treatment in the 12 weeks after baseline.\n\nAdditional exclusion criteria only for patients completing MRI (approximately 40 of 60 enrolled subjects; subjects must not...)\n\n1. Have current or prior cancer in the spine, brainstem, or brain (to allow standard brain MRI analysis)\n2.
