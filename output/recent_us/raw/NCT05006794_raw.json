study treatment.\n\n  --Note: If a single ECG shows a QTcF with an absolute value > 500 ms, two additional ECGs at intervals of approximately 3 min must be performed within 30 min after the initial ECG, and the average of these three consecutive results for QTcF will be used to determine eligibility.\n* Inability to swallow tablets\n* Previously identified allergy or hypersensitivity to components of the study treatment formulations.\n* Known HIV infection with a detectable viral load within 6 months of the anticipated start of treatment.\n\n  --Note: Subjects on effective

evaluation that includes clinical history, physical examination, radiographic findings, and TB testing in line with local practice), hepatitis B (known positive HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) result), or

Subjects positive for hepatitis C (HCV) antibody are eligible only if polymerase chain reaction is negative for HCV RNA.\n* Medical, psychiatric, cognitive, or other conditions that may compromise the subject's ability to understand the subject information, give informed consent, comply with the study protocol or complete the study.\n* Subjects taking prohibited medications as described in Section 6.8.2.
