    "official_title": "A Phase II Study of Total Consolidative Metastasis-and-primary Directed Therapy (MPDT) for Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC).",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (mixed histology acceptable but must have clear cell component)\n* Metastatic clear cell RCC with 5 or fewer metastases at enrollment (excluding pulmonary nodules <1.0cm)\n* Stable disease or partial response as assessed by investigators following at least 6 months of immune checkpoint blockade-based therapy.\n* Has disease amenable for total consolidative focal therapy (this will be determined by a multidisciplinary team which may include a combination of medical oncologists, urologists, interventional radiologists, and radiation oncologists).\n* ECOG performance status < 2\n* Must have archival tissue (slide or Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded tissue) preceding prior systemic treatment for comparison to tissue from consolidation\n* Consolidation surgery and biopsies are strongly encouraged to be within 42 days +/- 7 days of holding systemic therapy.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Subjects who have progressed during the first 6 months of immune checkpoint-blockade based therapy as determined by study investigator.\n* Subjects who have a need for urgent focally directed therapy (i.e. symptomatic brain or spinal metastases). Stable spinal metastases resected and/or treated with SBRT in advance of or concurrently with immune checkpoint-blockade based therapy are allowed to participate.\n* Any female of child-bearing potential who has a positive urine pregnancy test within 72 hours before screening. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required. Participants must be excluded/discontinued from the trial in the event of a positive or borderline positive serum pregnancy test result.",
