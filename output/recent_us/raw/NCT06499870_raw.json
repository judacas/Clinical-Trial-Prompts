(Pregnancy test can be urine or serum.)\n\n  * NOTE: If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required.\n  * A female of childbearing potential is a sexually mature female who:\n\n    * 1) Has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral hysterectomy; or\n    * 2) Has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months (i.e. has had menses at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months)\n* Provide informed written consent ≤ 28 days prior to registration\n* Willing to return to enrolling institution for follow-up (during the active monitoring phase of the study, i.e., active treatment)\n* Willing to provide mandatory blood specimens for correlative research purposes\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Any of the following because this study involves an investigational agent whose genotoxic, mutagenic, and teratogenic effects on the developing fetus and newborn are unknown:\n\n  * Pregnant persons\n  * Nursing persons\n  * Persons of childbearing potential who are unwilling to employ adequate contraception (men and women)\n* Co-morbid systemic illness or other severe concurrent disease which, in the judgement of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into the study or interfere significantly with the proper assessment of safety and toxicity of the prescribed regimens\n* Receiving any other investigational agent which would be considered treatment for the primary neoplasm ≤ 2 weeks prior to registration\n* Active uncontrolled autoimmune disease or syndrome (i.e. moderate or severe rheumatoid arthritis, moderate or severe psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, active inflammatory bowel disease) that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e. with use of disease-modifying agents, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive drugs) or who are receiving systemic therapy for an autoimmune or inflammatory disease (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency) is not considered a form of systemic treatment. Subjects are permitted to enroll if they have vitiligo, resolved childhood asthma/atopy, type I diabetes mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only requiring hormone replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger\n* Has a severe acute or chronic medical condition including immune colitis, inflammatory bowel disease (may be enrolled at the discretion of the principal investigator [PI]), immune pneumonitis, or laboratory abnormalities that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study treatment administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study\n* A history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to epacadostat, retifanlimab, bevacizumab, or other agents used in the study\n* Has had an allogeneic tissue/solid organ transplant\n* Has uncontrolled human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (HIV ½ antibodies). Well-controlled HIV is defined as CD4+ count > 300 cells, undetectable viral load, and receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)/antiretroviral therapy (ART). Study specific HIV testing is not required for patients who do not have any prior history of HIV\n* Has uncontrolled active hepatitis B (HBV) (e.g., hepatitis B serum antigen [HBsAg] reactive or HBV dioxyribonucleic acid [DNA] detected by quant real time polymerase chain reaction [RT PCR]) or hepatitis C (e.g. hepatitis C serum antigen [HCsAg] reactive or hepatitis C virus [HCV] ribonucleic acid [RNA] [qualitative or quantitative] is detected)\n* Receipt of live attenuated vaccine within 30 days before the first dose of study treatment. Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g. FluMist) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed",
