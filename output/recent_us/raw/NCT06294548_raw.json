    "inclusion_criteria": "* Participants must have histologically or cytologically confirmed invasive breast cancer with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic disease. Participants without pathologic or cytologic confirmation of metastatic disease should have unequivocal evidence of metastasis from physical examination or radiologic evaluation; i.e., visible chest wall disease or metastases on imaging meeting standard radiology criteria (i.e., lymph nodes larger than 1 cm in the short axis diameter).\n* The most recent pathology results will be considered for enrollment according to local testing of ER, PR and HER2 in a CLIA-certified environment. ER, PR and HER2 status per local testing must be known prior to study registration.\n* Participants with any HR status will be allowed on study. All participants must have history of HER2-low breast cancer (determined in any prior tumor sample), as defined below. The most recent tumor sample may be either HER2-low or HER2-0:\n\n  * HR-positive cohorts: ER and/or PR expression ≥1%\n  * HR-negative cohorts: ER and PR expression <1%\n  * All cohorts: The most recent HER2 pathology result must be HER2-0 or HER2-low (i.e., must not be HER2-positive).\n  * HER2-0: IHC 0+/ISH- or IHC 0+/ISH untested.\n  * HER2-low: IHC 2+/ISH-, IHC 1+/ISH-, or IHC 1+/ISH untested (note: ISH may be determined by either fluorescence in situ hybridization [FISH] or dual in situ hybridization [DISH]).\n* Participants must have measurable disease per RECIST 1.1.\n* Participants must be willing to undergo research tissue biopsies (at baseline prior to ADC1, after 3 weeks of treatment with ADC1, at progression on ADC1 or baseline prior to ADC2, and at progression on ADC2), if tumor is safely accessible.\n* Prior endocrine therapy: Participants with HR-positive breast cancer considered to be candidates for endocrine therapy must have: a) progressed on or within 12 months of adjuvant endocrine therapy or received at least one line of endocrine therapy in the metastatic setting, and b) received prior CDK4/6 inhibitor. Prior endocrine therapy does not require washout.\n* Prior chemotherapy: Prior lines of chemotherapy allowed in the metastatic setting are specified below. Prior topoisomerase I inhibitor therapy is not allowed in any setting, except as specified below for ADC2 cohorts. Participants may have discontinued all chemotherapy at least 14 days prior to study treatment initiation.

Confirmation of documented progressive disease on Dato-DXd (single-agent) as the most recent therapy is required prior to enrollment. No other topoisomerase I inhibitor is allowed in the metastatic setting.\n  * ADC2 Dato-DXd cohorts: Participants must have progressed on 1-2 prior lines in the metastatic setting, including T-DXd (single-agent) as the most recent therapy. Confirmation of documented progressive disease on T-DXd (single-agent) as the most recent therapy is required prior to enrollment. No other topoisomerase I inhibitor is allowed in the metastatic setting.\n* Prior biologic or targeted therapy: Patients must have discontinued all biologic or targeted therapy (e.g., CDK4/6 inhibitor) at least 14 days prior to study treatment initiation.

All toxicities related to prior investigational agents must have resolved to CTCAE v5.0 grade 1 or lower, unless otherwise specified per protocol.\n* Prior radiation therapy: Patients may have received prior radiation therapy. Radiation therapy must be completed at least 14 days prior to the initiation of study treatment (at least 7 days for SRS), and all toxicities related to prior radiation therapy must have resolved to CTCAE v5.0 grade 1 or lower, unless otherwise specified per protocol. A 7-day washout is permitted for palliative radiation (≤ 2 weeks of radiotherapy) to non-CNS disease.\n* Patients with history of treated CNS metastases are eligible, provided the following criteria are met:\n\n  * Disease outside the CNS is present.\n  * Prior SRS/SRT or WBRT should be completed ≥ 7 days before study treatment initiation.\n  * Recovery from acute toxicity associated with the treatment to ≤ CTCAE v5.0 grade 1 or baseline (with the exception of alopecia), with no requirement for escalating doses of corticosteroids over the past 7 days.\n* Patients with new or progressive brain metastases (active brain metastases) or leptomeningeal disease are eligible if the treating physician determines that immediate CNS specific treatment is not required and is unlikely to be required during the first cycle of therapy, there is no requirement for corticosteroids, and the patient is asymptomatic.\n* Participants on bisphosphonates or RANK ligand inhibitors may continue receiving therapy during study treatment and also may initiate therapy with these agents on study if clinically indicated.\n* The subject is ≥ 18 years old.\n* ECOG performance status 0-1 (Karnofsky > 60%).\n* Participants must have adequate organ and marrow function within 2 weeks prior to study treatment initiation as defined below:\n\n  * Absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mcL\n  * Platelets ≥ 100,000/mcL\n  * Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dl\n  * INR/PT/aPTT ≤ 1.5 × ULN unless participant is receiving anticoagulant therapy and PT or aPTT is in therapeutic range of anticoagulant\n  * Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) (or ≤ 3.0 x ULN in patients with documented Gilbert's Syndrome)\n  * AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤ 2.5 × institutional ULN or ≤ 5.0 × institutional ULN for participants with documented liver metastases\n  * Serum or plasma creatinine ≤ 1.5 × institutional ULN OR creatinine clearance (as calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault equation) ≥ 30 mL/min/ 1.73m2 for participants with creatinine levels above institutional ULN.\n* Resolution of all toxicities related to prior anticancer therapy to Grade ≤ 1 or baseline, including toxicities from ADC1 before enrolling to ADC2, unless otherwise specified per protocol.\n* For T-DXd cohorts, baseline LVEF ≥ 50% prior to registration, as measured by echocardiogram (or multiple-gated acquisition [MUGA] scan if an echocardiogram cannot be performed or is inconclusive).\n* Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to study treatment initiation.
