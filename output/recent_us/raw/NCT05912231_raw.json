    "inclusion_criteria": "* Age ≥ 18 years at the time of consent.\n* ECOG Performance Status of ≤ 2 within 28 days prior to registration.\n* Unresectable advanced or metastatic RCC to include both clear cell and non-clear histologies.\n\noPatients who have suspected metastatic RCC, which has not yet been pathologically proven, may be enrolled if they plan to undergo a cytoreductive nephrectomy, metastectomy, or biopsy. Fresh tissue from one of these procedures can be used for the clinical trial requirements (eligibility #4) as well as serve as pathologic confirmation of RCC.

If a target lesion is biopsied at screening, this lesion must be followed as non-target lesion after the biopsy unless it is the patient's only target lesion. If there is only one target lesion, it should be followed as a target lesion regardless.\n\n  * The archival specimen must contain adequate viable tumor tissue.\n  * The specimen may consist of a tissue block (preferred and should contain the highest grade of tumor) or at least 30 unstained serial sections. Fine-needle aspiration, brushings, cell pellet from pleural effusion, bone marrow aspirate/biopsy are not acceptable.\n* Previously untreated or treated subjects with no limit on prior lines of systemic therapies are allowed. Patient may have received prior adjuvant therapy.\n* Measurable disease as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors RECIST 1.1 within 28 days prior to registration.\n\n  * Demonstrate adequate organ function as defined in the table below.

Subjects with documented liver or bone metastases should have alkaline phosphatase ≤ 5 x ULN\n* Subjects with known Gilbert's disease should have a serum bilirubin ≤ 3 x ULN.\n\n  --Albumin > 2.5 g/dL\n* Coagulation\n\n  * International Normalized Ratio (INR) or Prothrombin Time (PT)\n  * Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) ≤ 1.5 × ULN (unless on prophylactic or therapeutic dosing with low molecular weight heparin)\n\n    * Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 28 days prior to registration. NOTE: Females are considered of child bearing potential unless they are surgically sterile (have undergone a hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or they are naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months.\n    * Females of childbearing potential and males must be willing to abstain from heterosexual activity or to use 2 forms of effective methods of contraception from the time of informed consent until 120 days after treatment discontinuation. The two contraception methods can be comprised of two barrier methods, or a barrier method plus a hormonal method.\n    * As determined by the enrolling physician or protocol designee, ability of the subject to understand and comply with study procedures for the entire length of the study.\n\nExclusion Criteria\n\n* Subjects meeting any of the criteria below may not participate in the study:\n* Prior use of systemic checkpoint inhibitors for the management of metastatic RCC is excluded. Prior IFN-α or IL-2 is allowed.\n* Receipt of any type of small molecule kinase inhibitor (including investigational kinase inhibitors) within 2 weeks of enrollment or receipt of any anti-cancer therapy (including investigational therapy, monoclonal antibodies, cytokine therapy) within 4 weeks of enrollment.\n* Treatment with systemic immunosuppressive medications including but not limited to:\n* prednisone, dexamethasone, cyclosporin, azathioprine, methotrexate, thalidomide, anti- tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents within 2 weeks of first study dose.\n* Subjects who have received acute, low-dose systemic immunosuppressant medications may be enrolled (such as steroids for acute nausea or cancer-related pain ≤ 10 mg prednisone) may be enrolled sooner than 2 weeks of first study dose.\n* Subjects with adrenal insufficiency on physiologic replacement doses of steroids may be enrolled (≤ 10 mg prednisone).\n* The use of inhaled, topical, ocular or intra-articular corticosteroids and mineralocorticoids are allowed.\n* Treatment with a receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) inhibitor (e.g. denosumab) within 2 weeks of first study dose.\n* Radiotherapy for RCC within 14 days of first study treatment with the exception of a single fraction of radiation administered for palliation of symptoms.\n* Known active metastases to the brain, spinal cord or leptomeninges unless adequately treated with radiotherapy, radiosurgery, or surgery and stable for at least 4 weeks of first study treatment as documented by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computerized tomography (CT) imaging and having no ongoing requirement for steroids.\n* Malignancies other than RCC within 5 years of first study treatment with the exception of those with negligible risk of metastases or death and/or treated with expected curative outcome (carcinoma in situ of the cervix, basal or squamous cell skin cancer, localized prostate cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast, non-muscle invasive urothelial carcinoma).\n* History of severe allergic, anaphylactic, or other hypersensitivity reactions to chimeric or humanized antibodies or fusion protein.\n* Known hypersensitivity to any component of the nivolumab or ipilimumab product.\n* Any active or recent history (within 6 months of first study dose) of autoimmune disease or syndrome that requires systemic corticosteroids (>10 mg daily prednisone equivalent) or immunosuppressive medications including but not limited to: myasthenia gravis, myositis, autoimmune hepatitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, vascular thrombosis associated with anti-phospholipid syndrome, Wegner's granulomatosis, Sjogren's syndrome, Guillain-Barre syndrome, multiple sclerosis, vasculitis, or glomerulonephritis.
