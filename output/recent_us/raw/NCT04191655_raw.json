For this reason, pregnant women will be excluded (Urine test for screening), women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. This includes all female participants, between the onset of menses (as early as 8 years of age) and 55 years unless the participant presents with an applicable exclusionary factor which may be one of the following:\n\n   Postmenopausal (no menses in greater than or equal to 12 consecutive months).
