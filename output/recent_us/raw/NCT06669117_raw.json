Systemic treatment with radionuclides within 6 weeks before first dose of study treatment. Subjects with clinically relevant ongoing complications from prior radiation therapy are not eligible\n* Known brain metastases or cranial epidural disease unless adequately treated with radiotherapy and/or surgery (including radiosurgery) and stable for at least 4 weeks prior to first dose of study treatment after radiotherapy or at least 4 weeks prior to first dose of study treatment after major surgery (e.g., removal or biopsy of brain metastasis).

Eligible subjects must be neurologically asymptomatic and without corticosteroid treatment at the time of first dose of study treatment\n* Administration of a live, attenuated vaccine within 30 days before first dose of study treatment\n* The subject has uncontrolled, significant intercurrent or recent illness including, but not limited to, the following conditions:\n\n  * Any condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (> 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days before first dose of study treatment. Note: Inhaled, intranasal, intra-articular, or topical steroids are permitted. Adrenal replacement steroid doses ≤ 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent are permitted. Transient short-term use of systemic corticosteroids for allergic conditions (e.g., contrast allergy) is also allowed\n  * Active infection requiring systemic treatment.
