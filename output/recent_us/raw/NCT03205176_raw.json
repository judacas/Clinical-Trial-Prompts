    "exclusion_criteria": "* Use of an investigational agent or an investigational device within 4 weeks or within a time interval less than at least 5 half-lives of the investigational agent, whichever is shorter, before administration of first dose of study drug.\n* Active, known or suspected autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment within the past 2 months or a documented history of clinically severe autoimmune disease that requires systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents. (Exceptions include any patient on 10 mg or less of prednisone or equivalent, patients with vitiligo, hypothyroidism stable on hormone replacement, Type I diabetes, Graves' disease, Hashimoto's disease, alopecia areata, eczema, or with PI approval.)\n* History of allergy or hypersensitivity to study drug components\n* History of organ transplant that requires use of immune suppressive agents\n* Current active pneumonitis within 90 days of planned start of the study or a known history of interstitial lung disease, drug-related pneumonitis, or radiation pneumonitis requiring steroid treatment.\n* Prior surgery or radiotherapy encompassing >20% of the bone marrow within 14 days of therapy. Patients must have recovered from all radiation-related toxicities.\n* Active infection requiring systemic therapy; a known history of active tuberculosis.\n* Has known active hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (e.g., hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] reactive) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (e.g., HCV ribonucleic acid [RNA] qualitative is detected)\n* Has known immunodeficiency or active human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1/2 antibodies) with CD 4 count < 400 for in the past 6 months.\n* Prolonged corrected QT interval (QTcF) > 450 ms for men\n* History of unstable or deteriorating cardiac disease within the previous 6 months prior to screening including but not limited to the following:\n\n  1.
