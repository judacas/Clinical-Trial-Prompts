Therapeutic anticoagulation with warfarin is allowed if target INR =< 3 on a stable dose of warfarin or on a stable dose of low molecular weight (LMW) heparin for > 2 weeks (14 days) at the time of enrollment.\n* Patients with controlled brain metastases are allowed on protocol if they had solitary brain metastases that was surgically resected or treated with radiosurgery or Gamma knife, without recurrence or edema for 1 month (4 weeks).\n* Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of human chorionic gonadotropin [HCG]) within 24 hours prior to the start of the study drug.\n* Women must not be breastfeeding.\n* WOCBP must agree to follow instructions for method(s) of contraception from the time of enrollment for the duration of treatment with study drug (s) plus 5 half-lives of study drug (s) plus 30 days (duration of ovulatory cycle) for a total of 5 months post treatment completion.\n* Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must agree to follow instructions for method(s) of contraception for the duration of treatment with study drug (s) plus 5 half-lives of study drug (s) plus 90 days duration of sperm turnover for a total of 5 months post-treatment completion.\n* Azoospermic males and WOCBP who are continuously not heterosexually active are exempt from contraceptive requirements. However WOCBP must still undergo pregnancy testing as described in these sections.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Patients must not have any other malignancies within the past 2 years except for in situ carcinoma of any site, or adequately treated (without recurrence post-resection or post-radiotherapy) carcinoma of the cervix or basal or squamous cell carcinomas of the skin.\n* Patients currently receiving anticancer therapies or who have received anticancer therapies (including chemotherapy and targeted therapy) within 2 weeks (14 days) prior to study day are excluded. Patients who have completed palliative radiation therapy more than 14 days prior to the first dose of the combination ipilimumab plus nivolumab are eligible.\n* Patients, who have had a major surgery or significant traumatic injury (injury requiring > 4 weeks [28 days] to heal) within 4 weeks (28 days) of start of study drug, patients who have not recovered from the side effects of any major surgery (defined as requiring general anesthesia) or patients that are expected to require major surgery, other than cytoreductive nephrectomy +/- retroperitoneal lymph node dissection, during the course of the study.\n* Patients who have organ allografts.\n* Known or suspected autoimmune disease. Patients with a history of inflammatory bowel disease (including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) and autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic progressive sclerosis (scleroderma), systemic lupus erythematosus or autoimmune vasculitis (e.g., Wegener's granulomatosis) are excluded from this study.

If hepatitis C antibody test is positive then active infection has to be confirmed by hepatitis C RNA testing for the patient to be excluded.\n* Any underlying medical condition, which in the opinion of the investigator, will make the administration of study drug hazardous or obscure the interpretation of adverse events, such as a condition associated with frequent diarrhea, uncontrolled nausea or vomiting.\n* Patients must not have received prior anticancer therapy with anti-PD1, anti-PD-L1, or anti- CTLA-4 immune checkpoint inhibitors.\n* Patients receiving any concomitant systemic therapy for renal cell cancer are excluded.\n* Patients must not be scheduled to receive another experimental drug while on this study.\n* Patients who are on high dose steroid (e.g., > 10 mg prednisone daily or equivalent) or other more potent immune suppression medications (e.g., infliximab).

A brief course (< 48 hours) of systemic corticosteroids for prophylaxis (e.g., from contrast dye allergy) is permitted.

Uncontrolled adrenal insufficiency.\n* Patients must not have history of other diseases, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that contraindicates the use of ipilimumab or nivolumab or that might affect the interpretation of the results of the study or render the subject at high risk from treatment complications.\n* Patients should not receive immunization with attenuated live vaccines within one week (7 days) of study entry or during study period; Note: Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist) are live attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.\n* Uncontrolled brain or leptomeningeal metastases, including patients who continue to require glucocorticoids for brain or leptomeningeal metastases.\n* Female patients who are pregnant or breast feeding, or adults of reproductive potential who are not using effective birth control methods as defined above.
