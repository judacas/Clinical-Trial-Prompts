Has symptomatic anemia defined as hemoglobin < 10.5 g/dL with any of the following.\n\n   * Tachypnea\n   * Shortness of breath\n   * Fatigue\n   * Malaise\n   * Worsening of cardiovascular function\n   * Asthenia\n   * Dyspnea on exertion\n   * Angina\n   * Other subject symptoms the subject reports as being associated with being anemic.\n7. Stated willingness to comply with all study procedures and availability for the duration of the study\n8. Ability to take oral medication and be willing to adhere to the medication regimen.\n9.

For males of reproductive potential: agreement to use of condoms\n11. Adequate organ function defined as:\n\n    * Hepatic function: total bilirubin <1.5 x ULN (unless attributable to Gilbert's disease), AST or ALT < 3x ULN\n    * Renal function: creatinine clearance > 30 mL/minute, calculated by Cockcroft-Gault formula\n12. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign the IRB approved informed consent document.\n13.
