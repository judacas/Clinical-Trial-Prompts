A minimum of 5/10 match is required and will be considered sufficient evidence that the donor and recipient share one HLA haplotype.\n* No more than 30 years of age\n* Lansky or Karnofsky performance status > 50%\n* Adequate organ function as defined below:\n\n  * Cardiac: LVEF ≥ 40% at rest or SF ≥ 26%\n  * Hepatic:\n\n    * Total bilirubin < 3 x IULN for age\n    * AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) < 5 x IULN\n  * Renal: GFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73m2 as estimated by updated Schwartz formula for ages 1-17 years (see Appendix B), 24-hour creatinine clearance, or renal scintigraphy. If GFR is abnormal for age based on updated Schwartz formula, accurate measurement should be obtained by either 24-hour creatinine clearance or renal scintigraphy. Renal function may also be estimated by serum creatinine based on age/gender. A minimum serum creatinine of 2x upper limit of normal is required for inclusion on this protocol.\n  * Pulmonary:\n\n    * O2 saturation ≥ 92% on room air without positive pressure support\n    * FEV1, FVC, and DLCO ≥ 50% of predicted (for children unable to perform a pulmonary function test, a high-resolution CT chest may be obtained)\n* The effects of these treatments on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, patients of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control, abstinence) prior to study entry and for 24 months following transplant. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she must inform her treating physician immediately.\n* Ability to understand and willingness to sign an IRB approved written informed consent document (or that of legally authorized representative, if applicable).\n\nRecipient\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have maximum age of 30 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Available matched related donor. A patient with a matched unrelated donor is eligible if urgent transplantation is required. A prior unrelated donor search is not required for enrollment.\n* Active non-hematologic malignancy. History of other malignancy is acceptable as long as therapy has been complete and there is no evidence of disease.\n* Currently receiving any other investigational agents.\n* Active CNS or extramedullary disease. History of CNS or extramedullary disease now in remission is acceptable.\n* A history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to conditioning agents used in the study.\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection (bacterial, viral with clinical instability, or fungal), symptomatic congestive heart failure, or unstable cardiac arrhythmia.\n* Presence of significant anti-donor HLA antibodies per institutional standards. Anti-donor HLA Antibody Testing is defined as a positive crossmatch test of any titer (by complement dependent cytotoxicity or flow cytometric testing) or the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of any anti-donor HLA antibody by solid phase immunoassay.\n* Presence of a second major disorder deemed a contraindication for HSCT.\n* Pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 14 days of the start of conditioning.\n\nDonor Eligibility Criteria:\n\n* At least 6 months of age\n* Meets the selection criteria as defined by the Foundation for the Accreditation of Hematopoietic Cell Therapy (FACT).\n* Able to understand and willing to sign an IRB-approved written informed consent document (or that of legally authorized representative, if applicable).",
