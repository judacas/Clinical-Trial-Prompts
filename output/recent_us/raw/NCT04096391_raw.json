    "official_title": "Phase II Trial of Ixazomib Combined with Gemcitabine and Doxorubicin in Patients with Renal Medullary Carcinoma",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Patients with locally advanced or metastatic RMC histologically confirmed by expert pathology review and loss of SMARCB1 staining by immunohistochemistry. Also eligible are patients with other rare SMARCB1-negative tumors of the kidney, such as advanced or metastatic unclassified renal cell carcinoma with medullary phenotype (a rare RMC variant occurring in individuals without sickle hemoglobinopathies), and adult-onset malignant rhabdoid tumors. The principal investigator (PI) is the final arbiter in questions related to eligibility.\n* Patients will be eligible regardless of whether they have had prior nephrectomy or still have their primary tumor in-situ. Patients with prior nephrectomy can be screened for enrollment at any time following the procedure.\n* Patients must have at least one measurable site of disease, defined as a lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) and measures >= 15 mm with conventional techniques or >= 10 mm with more sensitive techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or spiral computed tomography (CT) scan. If the patient has had previous radiation to the marker lesion(s), there must be evidence of progression since the radiation. Patients with disease confined to bone may be eligible if a measurable lytic defect is present or a serum marker is elevated (> 4 x upper limit of normal [ULN]). The PI is the final arbiter in questions related to measurability.\n* Patients can have received prior immunotherapies such as anti-PD1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-CTLA-4 immune checkpoint inhibitors, or targeted therapies such as sunitinib, pazopanib, axitinib, cabozantinib, bevacizumab, erlotinib, and everolimus, or any cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens with the exception of regimens using a combination of gemcitabine >= 800 mg/m^2 plus adriamycin >= 30 mg/m^2. In addition, the total lifetime dose of doxorubicin prior to enrollment must not exceed 382 mg/m^2 as these would preclude patients from receiving at least 4 cycles of induction therapy of the trial protocol. Patients must not have received any proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib or carfilzomib.\n* There must be evidence of progression on or after last treatment regimen received.\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2. NOTE: If subject is unable to walk due to paralysis, but is mobile in a wheelchair, subject is considered to be ambulatory for the purpose of assessing their performance status.\n* Adolescent patients age 12 years and older are allowed with signed assent and parental consent according to institutional guidelines and requirements, as long as their body surface area (BSA) is >=1.2 given that this is the lower limit for which the independence between BSA and ixazomib exposure has been ascertained.\n* Hemoglobin >= 9 g/dl (treatment allowed). May receive transfusion (within 14 days of the first dose of the study drugs).\n* Absolute neutrophil count >= 1000/uL. Without growth factor support (filgrastim or pegfilgrastim) for at least 14 days (within 14 days of the first dose of the study drugs).\n* Platelets >= 75,000/uL. Platelet transfusions to help patients meet eligibility criteria are not allowed within 3 days before study enrollment (within 14 days of the first dose of the study drugs).\n* Total bilirubin =< 1.5 mg/dl. For patients with Gilbert's disease, total bilirubin should be =< 3 mg/dL (=< 51.3 umol/L) (within 14 days of the first dose of the study drugs).\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT]) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT]) =< 2.5 X institutional ULN, except in known hepatic metastasis, wherein may be =< 5 x ULN as per current American Society of Clinical Oncology recommendations. Approximately 15% of patients with RMC develop liver metastases (within 14 days of the first dose of the study drugs).\n* Creatinine clearance > 30 mL/kg/1.73 m^2. If creatinine is not < 1.5 x ULN, then calculate by Cockcroft-Gault methods or local institutional standard (within 14 days of the first dose of the study drugs).\n* International normalized ratio (INR) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) =< 1.5 x ULN prior to study entry. Therapeutic anticoagulation with warfarin is allowed if target INR =< 3 on a stable dose of warfarin or other oral anticoagulant, or on a stable dose of low molecular weight (LMW) heparin for > 2 weeks (14 days) at the time of enrollment. Patients who have liver metastases resulting in INR and/or PTT > 1.5 x ULN and require chronic (>= 3 months) anticoagulation are not allowed.\n* Patients must have a measured ejection fraction of at least 45% as measured by either multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan, echocardiogram, stress test, or ventriculography.\n* Patients with controlled brain metastases are allowed on protocol if they have solitary brain metastasis that is asymptomatic and not requiring treatment or that was surgically resected or treated with radiosurgery or gamma knife, without recurrence or edema for 1 month (4 weeks).\n* Female patients who\n\n  * Are postmenopausal for at least 1 year before the screening visit, OR\n  * Are surgically sterile, OR\n  * Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of human chorionic gonadotropin [HCG]) within 24 hours prior to the start of the study drug.\n* Women must not be breastfeeding.\n* WOCBP must agree to practice 2 effective method(s) of contraception, at the same time, from the time of enrollment for the duration of treatment with study drug (s) plus 5 half-lives of study drug (s) plus 30 days (duration of ovulatory cycle) for a total of 5 months post treatment completion, or agree to practice true abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. (Periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception). Complete abstinence is defined as complete avoidance of heterosexual intercourse and is an acceptable form of contraception for all study drugs.\n* Abstinence is only acceptable when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, profession of abstinence for entry into a clinical trial, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. Subjects who choose complete abstinence are not required to use a second method of contraception, but female subjects must continue to have pregnancy tests. Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective contraception must be discussed in the event that the subject chooses to forego complete abstinence.\n* Men who are sexually active with WOCBP, even if surgically sterilized (i.e., status post-vasectomy), must agree to follow instructions for method(s) of contraception for the duration of treatment with study drug (s) plus 5 half-lives of study drug (s) plus 90 days duration of sperm turnover) for a total of 5 months post-treatment completion.\n* Azoospermic males and WOCBP who are continuously not heterosexually active are exempt from contraceptive requirements. However WOCBP must still undergo pregnancy testing as described in these sections.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 12 Years",
