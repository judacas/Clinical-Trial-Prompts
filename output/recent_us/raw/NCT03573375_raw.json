The donor and recipient must be HLA identical for at least one antigen (using high resolution DNA based typing) at the following genetic loci: HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, and HLA-DRB1.

Acute severe vaso-occlusive pain episodes requiring hospitalization and recalcitrant to maximum medical therapy. Episodes of pain to be adjudicated by selected committee.\n   5. One acute chest syndrome episode resulting in intensive care admission requiring non-mechanical ventilatory support: simple nasal cannula, face mask that requires oxygen content (venti mask, non-rebreather), simple nasal cannula, face mask O2(e.g. ventimask, rebreather), CPAP, SiPAP, BiPAP, high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) or invasive mechanical ventilatory support (delivered by ETT or trach).\n   6. Right heart catheterization confirmed pulmonary artery pressure >25 mmHG or mean pulmonary vascular resistance 206(57-421) dyn·s·cm-5\n   7. Essential hypertension on antihypertensive medications >95% upper limit of normal age (as defined according to the American Academy of Pediatrics)\n   8. Recurrent priapism (episodes lasting at least 4 hours at least twice in the last 12 months or 3 times in the last 24 months) recalcitrant to medical treatment or unable to use hydroxyurea due to SCD phenotype with the approval of the adjudication committee\n\nInclusion Criteria for Stratum 2: Adults Ages 15.00 - 45.99 at enrollment\n\nParticipants with sickle cell anemia (Hb SS or Sß° Thalassemia) who are 15.00 - 45.99 years of age at enrollment AND who have one or more of the following:\n\n1. Age 15.00 - 45.99 years at Segment A enrollment\n2. Participants with sickle cell anemia (Hb SS or Sß° Thalassemia) who have one or more of the following:\n\n   1.

History of three or more severe vaso-occlusive pain crises per year in the 2-year period preceding enrollment despite the institution of supportive care measures (i.e. a pain management plan and/or treatment with hydroxyurea); painful episodes related to priapism, osteonecrosis or any sickle-related complication are acceptable;\n   4.

    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Participants who have an HLA-matched sibling who is able and willing to donate bone marrow. Patients with a HLA-matched unrelated donor are not excluded.\n2. Uncontrolled bacterial, viral or fungal infection in the 6 weeks before enrollment (currently taking medication with evidence of progression of clinical symptoms or radiologic findings).\n3.

Participants who have had an Encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis (EDAS) procedure in the 6 months prior to enrollment\n6. Participants who have received a prior solid organ transplant\n7. Participants who have participated in another clinical trial in which the patient received an investigational or off-label use of a drug or device within 3 months of enrollment.\n8. Females who are pregnant or breastfeeding.\n9. Participants with clinically significant, uncontrolled autoimmune disease, requiring active medical management (immunosuppressive therapy or chemotherapy), which, in the judgment of the local Principal Investigator, indicates that the patient could not tolerate transplantation.\n10. Females of child bearing potential (to include all female participants > 10 years of age, unless postmenopausal for a minimum of 1 year before the time of consent or surgically sterilized), who do not agree to practice two (2) effective methods of contraception at the same time, or do not agree to practice true abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject, from the time of signing of informed consent through 12 months post-transplant.\n11. Males (even if surgical sterilized) who do not agree to practice effective barrier contraception, or who do not agree to practice true abstinence from the time of signing informed consent through 12 months post-transplant.\n12. Presence of anti-donor specific HLA antibodies. HLA antibody presence and specificity will be determined by solid phase immunoassays. An anti-donor specific HLA antibody will be considered positive when the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) is higher than the cut-off defined by each institution. Recommended cut-off values are MFI >1000 for donor specific antibody to HLA-A, -B, and DRB1 and MFI >2000 for HLA-C, DQB1 and DPB1. This must be measured before the final donor selection, and < 100 days before enrollment in Segment A (preferably < 30 days before Segment A enrollment). If MFI >1000 for donor specific antibody to HLA-A, -B, DRB1 and/or MFI >2000 for HLA-C, DQB1 and DPB1, documentation must be submitted to the DCC coordinator for review and approval by a Protocol Chair and/or Protocol Officer prior to enrollment",
