Treatment for ≥3 months with inadequate efficacy response defined as <10% spleen volume reduction by MRI or <30% decrease from baseline in spleen length by physical examination or regrowth to these parameters following an initial response; and/or\n  2. Treatment for ≥28 days complicated by either\n\n  i. Development of a red blood cell transfusion requirement (at least 2 units/month for 2 months) ii. National Cancer Institute (NCI) CTCAE grade ≥ 3 AEs of thrombocytopenia, anemia, hematoma, and/or hemorrhage while being treated with a dosage of < 20 mg BID\n* Recovery to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline of any toxicities due to prior systemic treatments, excluding alopecia\n* Women of child bearing potential (WCBP), defined as a sexually mature woman not surgically sterilized or not post-menopausal for at least 24 consecutive months if ≤55 years or 12 months if >55 years, must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening and cycle 1 day 1 and must agree to use adequate methods of birth control throughout the study. Adequate methods of contraception include use of oral contraceptives or Depo-Provera, with an additional barrier method (diaphragm with spermicidal gel or condoms with spermicide), double-barrier methods (diaphragm with spermicidal gel and condoms with spermicide), partner vasectomy, and total abstinence.\n* Male subjects should agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting with the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy.\n* Must have adequate organ function as demonstrated by the following:\n\n  1. ALT (SGPT) and/or AST (SGOT) ≤ 3x upper limit of normal (ULN), or ≤ 4 x ULN (if upon judgment of the treating physician, it is believed to be due to extramedullary hematopoiesis [EMH] related to MF);\n  2. Direct bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN; or ≤ 2x ULN (if upon judgment of the treating physician, it is believed to be due to extra-medullary hematopoiesis related to MF or documented Gilbert's syndrome);\n  3. Serum creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dL;\n  4. Platelet count ≥25 x 109/L\n* Ability to adhere to the study visit schedule and all protocol requirements\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
