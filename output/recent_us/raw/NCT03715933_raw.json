    "inclusion_criteria": "* INCLUSION CRITERIA:\n* Participants must have histologically or cytologically confirmed cancer that falls into one of three cohorts: (1) metastatic melanoma or advanced locoregional melanoma not amenable to curative surgical resection and refractory to anti-PD-1 therapy; (2) metastatic renal cell carcinoma (clear cell histology) refractory to at least one line of PD1/PDL1 based therapy; (3) metastatic or advanced locoregional melanoma not amenable to curative surgical resection and naive to anti-PD-1 therapy.\n* Participants must have measurable disease (per RECIST v1.1 criteria), metastatic melanoma or renal cell cancer.\n* Age >=18 years of age.\n* Clinical performance status of ECOG 0 or 1.\n* Willing to practice birth control from the time of enrollment on this study and for four months after treatment.\n* Must have a negative pregnancy test because of the potentially dangerous effects of the treatment on the fetus.\n* Seronegative for HIV antibody. (The experimental treatment being evaluated in this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Participants who are HIV seropositive may have decreased immune-competence and thus be less responsive to the experimental treatment and more susceptible to its toxicities.)\n* Seronegative for hepatitis B antigen and for hepatitis C antibody. If hepatitis C antibody test is positive, then participant must be tested for the presence of antigen by RT-PCR and be HCV RNA negative.\n* Participants must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:\n\n  * ANC > 1000/mm^3 without the support of filgrastim\n  * WBC >= 3000/mm^3\n  * Platelet count >= 100,000/mm^3\n  * Hemoglobin > 8.0 g/d (Subject may be transfused to reach this cut-off)\n  * Serum ALT/AST <= 5.0 x ULN\n  * Serum creatinine <= 1.6 mg/dL\n  * Total bilirubin <= 2.0 mg/dL, except in participants with Gilbert s Syndrome, who must have a total bilirubin < 3.0 mg/dL.\n* More than four weeks must have elapsed since completion of any prior systemic therapy at the time of enrollment.\n\nNote: Participant may have undergone minor surgical procedures or limited field radiotherapy within the four weeks prior to enrollment, as long as related major organ toxicities have recovered to <= grade 1.\n\n* Ability of subject to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n* Willing to sign a Durable Power of Attorney Form.\n* Subject must be co-enrolled on protocol 03-C-0277\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\n* Participant is nursing because of the potentially dangerous effects of the treatment on the fetus or infant.\n* Concurrent systemic steroid therapy.\n* Active systemic infections requiring anti-infective treatment, coagulation disorders, or any other active or uncompensated major medical illnesses.\n* Any form of primary immunodeficiency (such as Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Disease and AIDS).\n* History of major organ autoimmune disease.\n* Grade 3 or 4 major organ irAEs following treatment with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monotherapy, including but not limited to myocarditis, pneumonitis, colitis, and hepatotoxicity.\n* Concurrent opportunistic infections (The experimental treatment being evaluated in this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Participants who have decreased immune-competence may be less responsive to the experimental treatment and more susceptible to its toxicities.)\n* History of severe immediate hypersensitivity reaction to pembrolizumab or aldesleukin.\n* History of coronary revascularization or ischemic symptoms.\n* For select participants with a clinical history prompting cardiac evaluation: last known LVEF <= 45%.\n* For select participants with a clinical history prompting pulmonary evaluation: known FEV1 <= 50%.\n* Participant is receiving any other investigational agents.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
