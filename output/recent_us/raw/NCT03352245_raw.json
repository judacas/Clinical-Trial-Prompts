Ability to follow study instructions and likely to complete all study requirements.\n9. Written informed consent obtained, including consent for tissue to be examined and stored by the Central Histology Lab.\n10. Written consent to allow photographs of the target isSCC lesion to be used as part of the study data and documentation.\n11. For females of childbearing potential, a negative pregnancy test at screening and using an acceptable form of birth control (oral / implant/ injectable/ transdermal contraceptives, intrauterine device, condom, diaphragm, abstinence, or a monogamous relationship with a partner who has had a vasectomy).\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
