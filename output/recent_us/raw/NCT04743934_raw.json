Prior treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy or immunotherapy is allowed for both cohorts. Up to 3 lines of prior therapy is allowed.\n9. Patients must have adequate hematologic, coagulation, hepatic, and renal function. All laboratory tests must be obtained less than 4 weeks from study entry. This includes:\n\n   * ANC >/= 2,000/mm3 and white blood cells >/= 3,000/mm3\n   * platelet count >/=150,000/mm3\n   * HgB ≥ 8.5 g/dL\n   * Creatinine ≤ 30 mL/minute (using Cockroft-Gault formula).\n   * Total Serum Bilirubin ≤ ULN (unless with documented Gilbert Syndrome diagnosed by genetic testing)\n   * SGOT, SGPT ≤ 1.5 X ULN\n   * Cholestrol ≤ 350 mg/dL, 9.1 mmol/L, and triglyceride ≤ 500 mg/dL, 5.6 mmol/.\n10. Females of childbearing potential must not be breast feeding and must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 7 days of starting of treatment. The patient must agree to use adequate contraception for a minimum of two weeks prior to receiving study medication until 3 months after discontinuation of the study medication. Acceptable methods of contraception include total and true sexual abstinence, hormonal contraceptives that are not prone to drug-drug interactions (IUS Levonorgestrel Intra Uterine System (Mirena), Medroxyprogesterone injections (Depo-Provera)), copper-banded intra-uterine devices, and vasectomized partner. All hormonal methods of contraception should be used in combination with the use of a condom by their sexual male partner. Females of childbearing potential are defined as those who are not surgically sterile (i.e., bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or complete hysterectomy) or postmenopausal (defined as 12 months with no menses without an alternative medical cause). Women will be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrheic for the past 12 months without an alternative medical cause. The following age-specific requirements must also apply: Women < 50 years old: they would be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrheic for the past 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal treatments. The levels of Luteinizing Hormone (LH) and Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH) must also be in the post-menopausal range (as per the institution). Women ≥ 50 years old: they would be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrheic for the past 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments, or have had radiation-induced oophorectomy with the last menses > 1 year ago, or have had chemotherapy-induced menopause with >1 year interval since last menses, or have had surgical sterilization by either bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy.\n11. Non-sterilized males who are sexually active with a female partner of childbearing potential must use adequate contraception for the duration of the study and 3 months after the last dose of study medication. Adequate contraception methods include: birth control pills (e.g. combined oral contraceptive pill), barrier protection (e.g. condom plus spermicide, cervical/vault cap or intrauterine device), and abstinence. Patients should not father a child for 6 months after completion of the study medication. Patients should refrain from donating sperm from the start of dosing until 6 months after discontinuing the study medication. If male patients wish to father children they should be advised to arrange for freezing of sperm samples prior to the start of the study medication.\n12. Patients who meet eligibility criteria to either Cohort A or B will be allowed to enroll to the run-in cohort.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
