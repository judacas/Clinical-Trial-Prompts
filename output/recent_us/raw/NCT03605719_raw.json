    "official_title": "Phase I/II Study of Neoadjuvant mFOLFIRINOX in Combination With Peri-operative Oral Hydroxychloroquine (FHQ) in Subjects With Resectable Adenocarcinoma of the Pancreas.",
    "inclusion_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria\n\n* Subjects with biopsy-proven adenocarcinoma of the pancreas\n* Pancreatic protocol helical CT scan demonstrating absence of venous or arterial involvement, consistent with NCCN guidelines for resectable disease\n* ECOG performance status ≤ 1\n* No active second malignancy except for basal cell carcinoma of the skin\n* Normal renal, hepatic, and hematologic function at the time of enrollment as evidenced by:\n\n  * Serum creatinine level ≤1.5 the upper limits of normal\n  * Serum total bilirubin level ≤1.5 X ULN\n* White blood cell count ≥ 3.5x109/ml per ml and platelet count ≥ 100x109 per ml\n* For subjects with obstructive jaundice, the biliary tract must be drained with a temporary plastic or a short permanent metallic biliary stent\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n\nExclusion Criteria\n\n* Subjects deemed surgically unresectable or subjects unwilling to undergo surgical resection.\n* Subjects who have received chemotherapy within 12 months prior to study entry.\n* Subjects who are found to have loss-of-function mutations in DPYD or UGTA1 by Oneome pharmacogenomic testing, resulting in increased risk of mFOLFIRINOX toxicity. DPYD mutations have been noted in 5% of the overall population. Homozygous UGT1A1 mutations have been noted in 10% of North Americans.\n* Prior use of radiotherapy or investigational agents for pancreatic cancer.\n* Any evidence of metastasis to distant organs (liver, lung, peritoneum).\n* Cross sectional imaging suggesting portal vein, superior mesenteric artery, hepatic artery involvement that would make the patient borderline resectable or locally advanced\n* Symptomatic or endoscopic evidence of gastric outlet obstruction.\n* Concurrent malignancies with evidence of active or measurable disease except basal cell carcinoma of the skin.\n* Inability to adhere to study and/or follow-up procedures.\n* History of allergic reactions or hypersensitivity to the study drugs (chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, 5-Fluorouracil, Leucovorin, Oxaliplatin, Irinotecan).\n* Other concurrent experimental therapy.\n* The effects of HCQ, and mFOLFIRINOX on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. All females of childbearing potential must have a blood test or urine study within two weeks prior to registration to rule out pregnancy. Should a woman become pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. If a man impregnates a woman while participating in this study, he should inform his treating physician immediately as well.\n* Because patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with bone marrow-suppressive therapy, HIV-positive patients are excluded from the study. For patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy, the potential impact of pharmacokinetic interactions with HCQ and mFOLFIRINOX is unknown. Appropriate studies may be undertaken in patients with HIV and those receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy in the future.\n* Due to the risk of disease exacerbation, patients with porphyria are ineligible.\n* Patients with psoriasis are ineligible unless the disease is well controlled and they are under the care of a specialist who agrees to monitor the patient for exacerbations.\n* Patients requiring the use of enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic medication that includes: phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, primidone or oxcarbazepine are excluded.\n* Patients with previously documented macular degeneration or diabetic retinopathy are excluded.\n* Baseline EKG with QTc >470 msec (including subjects on medication). Subjects with ventricular pacemaker for whom QT interval is not measurable will be eligible on a case-by-case basis.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
