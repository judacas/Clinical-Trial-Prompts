    "official_title": "A Phase 1b / 2a, Open-label Platform Study to Evaluate Mirdametinib as Monotherapy or in Combination With Other Anticancer Agents in Patients With Advanced Solid Cancers Harboring MAPK-activating Mutations",
    "inclusion_criteria": "Subjects are eligible to start the treatment in the study only if all of the following criteria apply:\n\nArm 1 (metastatic breast cancer):\n\n* Female adults (≥18 years of age on the date of informed consent)\n* Postmenopausal or receiving ovarian suppression (including GnRH agonists such as goserelin)\n* Histologically confirmed hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer with evidence of progression on at least 1 prior line of therapy for metastatic disease which should have included a CDK4/6 inhibitor in combination with endocrine therapy. Prior chemotherapy is permitted.\n* ER+ as defined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) ≥1% by local laboratory testing (as per the ASCO-CAP guidelines)\n* HER2-negative, as defined by the negative in situ hybridization test (FISH, CISH, or SISH) or an IHC status of 0, 1+ or 2+ by local laboratory testing. If IHC is 2+ (i.e.\n\nindeterminate), then a negative in situ hybridization test (FISH, CISH, or SISH) is required (as per the ASCO-CAP guidelines).\n\n* NF1 loss of function or another MAPK-activating genomic alteration documented by a CLIA-certified NGS assay at any time before the start of treatment. Note: archival tissue, if available and collected within 6 months of enrollment, may be used for this testing in lieu of fresh tissue.\n\nArm 2 (advanced solid cancers):\n\n* Male or female adults (≥18 years of age on the date of informed consent)\n* Histologically confirmed advanced, metastatic solid tumor cancer for which there is no available therapy known to confer clinical benefit. Colorectal, anal, small bowel, biliary or ampullary cancers are not eligible.\n* Class 1 or class 2 MEK1 or MEK2 mutations, as described below, documented by a CLIA-certified NGS assay at any time before the start of treatment. Class 3 MEK1 or MEK2 mutations as described in that paper are excluded. A complete list of the mutations allowed based on that paper can be found below, however, rare mutations not listed in this table may be permitted at the discretion of the principal investigator of the study. Note: archival tissue, if available and collected within 6 months of enrollment, may be used for this testing in lieu of fresh tissue.\n\nClass 1 - Permitted: MEK1 D67N, MEK1 P124L, MEK1 P124S Class 2 - Permitted: MEK1 K57N, MEK1 C121S, MEK1 F53L, MEK1 Q56P Class 3 - Excluded: MEK1 L98-I103, MEK1 I99-K104, MEK1 E102-I103\n\nThe permitted mutations shown above are for MEK1. MEK1 and MEK2 are closely related, are structurally similar, share 79% amino acid identity, and they share equal ability to phosphylate their ERK substrates30. While the experiments performed above classify individual MEK1 mutations only, the class 3 mutations in MEK1 all share in-frame deletions that remove a potent negative regulatory element of MEK1. These are easily distinguishable from other mutations in MEK1. Therefore, the identification of exclusionary class 3 MEK2 alterations will be straightforward as well, with paralogous mutant residues in MEK1 and MEK2 defined in the manuscript above. A table showing the permitted enrolling paralogous class 1 and class 2 residues are shown in the table below, again with the caveat that rare mutations in MEK2 not listed in the table below may be eligible at the discretion of the principal investigator.\n\nMEK1: F53, Q56, K57, V60, D67, C121, P124, Y130, E203 MEK2: F57, Q60, K61, V64, D71, C125, P128, Y134, E207\n\nAll Arms:\n\n* Patient (or Legally Authorized Representative [LAR]) must sign written informed consent form before any study-specific procedure is performed\n* ECOG performance score of 0 or 1\n* Life expectancy of ≥3 months\n* At least one tumor lesion measurable by RECIST 1.1.

Note: Anti-hypertensive medications are permitted, and if a patient does not meet these eligibility criteria at time of screening, treatment with additional anti-hypertensive agents is permissible at the discretion of the investigator, and blood pressure can be rechecked at a subsequent visit. Measured blood pressures that fall out of this range after screening do not render patients ineligible, however every effort should be made to medically manage these elevated blood pressures at the investigator's discretion.\n  * LVEF ≥50% by MUGA or ECHO.\n  * No clinically significant ECG waveform abnormalities at the investigator's discretion\n  * QTcF ≤470 ms\n* Adequate serum lipid profile at screening, as determined by\n\n  ° Serum cholesterol <300 mg/dL\n\n  ° Serum triglycerides <300 mg/dL\n* Adequate glycemic control at screening, as determined by\n\n  ° Fasting blood glucose <140 mg/dL or\n\n  ° Random blood glucose <250 mg/dL Note: Anti-hyperglycemic medications are permitted if a patient does not meet these eligibility criteria at time of screening. Blood glucose measurements that fall out of this range do not render patients ineligible, and appropriate glycemic control at subsequent visits is at the discretion of the investigator.\n* Blood calcium and phosphate levels within normal levels per institutional lab standard at screening (calcium level may be corrected for albumin at the investigator's discretion)\n* Adequate ophthalmological exam in both eyes at screening, as determined by ° Intraocular pressure ≤21 mmHg\n\n  ° No clinically significant abnormalities on the ocular tomography (OCT), including no evidence of ocular abnormality that would be considered a significant risk factor for central serous retinopathy, retinal vein occlusion (RVO), or neovascular macular degeneration (mild and controlled / stable age-related macular degeneration may be acceptable at the investigator's discretion).\n* Able and willing to comply with all aspects of the protocol\n\nContraception and Pregnancy Testing\n\nArm 1 (ER-positive metastatic breast cancer):\n\n* Not applicable (subjects must be female and postmenopausal or receiving ovarian suppression)\n\nArm 2 (advanced solid cancers with MEK1 or MEK2 mutations):\n\n* Male subjects must agree to the following during the treatment period and for at least 6 months after the last dose of study treatment: ° Refrain from donating sperm\n\nAND either:\n\n° Be abstinent from heterosexual intercourse as their preferred and usual lifestyle (abstinent on a long term and persistent basis) and agree to remain abstinent\n\nOR\n\n* Must agree to use a male condom when having sexual intercourse with a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP).\n\n  - Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must\n* Have a negative pregnancy test at screening and within 72 hours before the start of treatment\n\nAND\n\n° Must agree to use a contraceptive method that is highly effective during the treatment period and for at least 6 months after the last dose of study treatment.
