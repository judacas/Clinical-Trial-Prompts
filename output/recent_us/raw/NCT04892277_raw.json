    "inclusion_criteria": "* Histological or cytological diagnosis of advanced, unresectable, and/or metastatic or relapsed/refractory solid tumor\n* Part 1A: Participants with solid tumors where anti-PD-(L)1 is an established treatment. Participants must have progressed on or following prior anti-PD-(L)1 therapy if approved, available, tolerable, and eligible\n* Part 1B: Participants either meeting Part 1A criterion, or participants with \"cold\" solid tumors where anti-PD-(L)1 therapy is not an established treatment\n* Part 2: Participants with NSCLC (2A Arm 1 and 2B) must have received platinum-based chemotherapy and anti-PD-(L)1 or have intolerability to or refusal of standard therapies. Participants with NSCLC who have not been previously treated with a prior anti-pd-(L) will be enrolled in Part 2C.\n* Participants with MSS CRC (Part 2A Arm 2) must have received fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan-based chemotherapy, an anti-VEGF agent and anti-EGFR inhibitor (if RAS wildtype) and/or other molecularly targeted therapy if appropriate. Participants with RCC (Part 2A Arm 3) must have received prior tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), anti-PD-(L)1 (if not receiving anti-PD-1 on protocol), anti-CTLA-4 (optional), hypoxia-inducible factor 2 alpha (HIF2a) inhibitor, or mTOR inhibitor or have documented intolerance to the standard therapy.\n* At least 1 measurable lesion based on RECIST 1.1 that has not been previously irradiated (Part 1 exceptions permitted after review and approval)\n* Able to provide pre-treatment (and optional on-treatment) tumor tissue\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Treatment with any systemic anticancer therapy within 4 weeks or 5 half-lives (whichever is shorter) prior to planned first dose\n* Active or history of clinically significant autoimmune disease or other medical condition that required chronic systemic immunosuppressive therapy within recent 2 years\n* Prior treatment with another LILRB1 (ILT2), LILRB2 (ILT4), and/or LILRB1/2 (B1 and B2) antagonist antibodies or pathway targeting agents, including HLA conformers and HLA-G antibodies.\n* Lack of adequate organ (bone marrow, renal, liver) function\n* History of severe immune-mediated adverse event or cytokine release syndrome that was considered related to prior immune modulatory therapy that required immunosuppressive therapy",
