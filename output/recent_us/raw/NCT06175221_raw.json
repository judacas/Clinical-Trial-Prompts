Additional mutations may be considered with principal investigator approval.\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 0-1.\n* At least 18 years of age.\n* Ability to swallow tablets.\n* Life expectancy >/=3 months\n* Ability to comply with outpatient treatment, laboratory monitoring, and required clinic visits for the duration of study participation.\n* Patients with cholangiocarcinoma must have adequate biliary drainage (per investigator's discretion), with no evidence of ongoing infection.\n* Willingness of men and women of reproductive potential to observe conventional and effective birth control for the duration of treatment and for 3 months following the last dose of study treatment.\n* Measurable or non-measurable disease as determined by RECIST 1.1.\n* Adequate organ function defined as:\n\n  * ALT or AST ≤ 3 × the ULN in the absence of liver metastases, OR ≤ 5 × ULN with documented liver metastases\n  * Total bilirubin ≤ 2.0 × ULN in the absence of Gilbert's Disease, OR ≤ 3 × ULN with Gilbert's Disease provided direct bilirubin is ≤ ULN\n  * Serum Creatinine ≤ 1.5 × ULN OR calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 60ml/min\n  * Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL (≥ 90 g/L)\n  * Absolute Neutrophil Count ≥ 1.5 x 109/L\n  * Platelets ≥ 75 x 109/L\n  * INR or PT, aPTT or PTT ≤ 1.5 × ULN unless participant is receiving anticoagulant therapy\n  * NOTE: Transfusions to increase a patient's hemoglobin level or initiation of erythropoietin or G-CSF therapy to meet enrollment criteria are not allowed in the 14 days preceding the first dose of study drug. If a patient receives transfusions, erythropoietin, or G-CSF therapy ≥ 14 days prior to the first dose, the hematologic criteria listed above must be met following the 14-day window and prior to the first dose of study therapy\n\nDose expansion cohort 1: Patients should fulfill the eligibility criteria above for all patients in addition to the following:\n\n* Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma\n* No prior treatment with a selective FGFR inhibitor treatment\n* FGFR2 fusion, in-frame rearrangement, or extracellular domain in-frame deletion on tumor profiling in tumor tissue as determined by testing routinely performed on tumor biopsy at a CLIA or other similarly certified laboratory. If the FGFR alteration is present on ctDNA analysis alone, the patient may be eligible with principal investigator approval.\n* An archived tumor tissue sample is available in patients not undergoing fresh tumor biopsy. Patients who do not have adequate archival tumor tissue available are required to undergo a fresh tumor biopsy. If a fresh biopsy cannot be safely performed, the patient may be eligible with principal investigator approval.\n\nDose expansion cohort 2: Patients should fulfill the eligibility criteria above for all patients in addition to the following:\n\n* Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma\n* Prior FGFR inhibitor treatment at any time prior to treatment start is required\n* FGFR2 fusion, in-frame rearrangement, or extracellular domain in-frame deletion for which they derived clinical benefit (objective response of any duration or stable disease for at least 6 months) from prior FGFR inhibitor therapy, as determined by testing routinely performed on tumor biopsy at a CLIA or other similarly certified laboratory. If the FGFR alteration is present on ctDNA analysis alone, the patient may be eligible with principal investigator approval\n* An archived tumor tissue sample after progression on or intolerance of prior FGFR inhibitor available in patients not undergoing fresh tumor biopsy. Patients who do not have adequate archival tumor tissue available are required to undergo a fresh tumor biopsy. If a fresh biopsy cannot be safely performed, the patient may be eligible with principal investigator approval.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Known hypersensitivity to afatinib or pemigatinib or excipients of pemigatinib\n* For patients treated with a prior FGFR inhibitor, those with known activating mutation(s) in the FGFR2 kinase domain on ctDNA or biopsy analysis within 8 weeks of start of study drugs; activating mutations in the FGFR2 kinase domain seen on ctDNA or biopsy analysis prior to the 8-week timepoint may be allowed after discussion with the study PI.\n* Systemic or liver-directed anticancer therapy within 2 weeks; or anticancer monoclonal antibody within 4 weeks prior to planned start of pemigatinib and afatinib.\n* Patient has adverse events from prior therapy that have not resolved to ≤ grade 1; exceptions for non-clinically meaningful adverse events (AEs) can be made with input from the principal investigator.\n* Major surgery within 4 weeks prior to planned start of pemigatinib and afatinib (tumor biopsy, biliary stent or catheter placement, and feeding tube placement are not considered major surgical procedures).\n* Received prior palliative non-CNS radiation within 2 weeks or extended-field radiation administered within 4 weeks of first dose of study drug. Subjects must have recovered from all radiation-related toxicities, not require corticosteroids, and not have had radiation pneumonitis. Fibrotic pulmonary disease from prior radiotherapy is permissible with approval of the study PI.\n* Known pre-existing interstitial lung disease\n* Current hypovitaminosis D requiring supraphysiologic (eg 50,000 IU/weekly) to replenish the deficiency. Vitamin D supplements are allowed.\n* History and/or current evidence of clinically significant ectopic mineralization/calcification or non-tumor related alteration of calcium-phosphorus homeostasis.\n* History and/or current evidence of clinically significant corneal or retinal disorder confirmed by ophthalmological examination\n* Child-Pugh B and C cirrhosis\n* Chronic nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea considered to be clinically significant in the opinion of the investigator.

Those on active HBV therapy with viral loads under 2000 IU/ml (104 copies/ml) should stay on antiviral therapy throughout the study treatment.\n* Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and on anti-retroviral therapy for HIV(excluded due to potential drug-drug interactions between anti-retroviral medications and study treatment but HIV itself is not an exclusion).\n* Known or suspected active drug or alcohol use\n* Concomitant treatment with known strong p-gp inhibitor.\n* Use of any potent CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers or moderate CYP3A4 inducers within 14 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) before the first dose of study treatment.\n\n  -- Note: Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors are not prohibited\n* Pregnancy during the study or within 30 days of the last dose of study intervention. Also excluded are any persons of childbearing potential, including men who are able to father a child, who are unwilling to use a medically acceptable method of contraception during the trial (see below section 3.3).
