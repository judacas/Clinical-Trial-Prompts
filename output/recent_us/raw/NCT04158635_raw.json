For patients undergoing diagnostic laparoscopy, surgeon considers that optimal debulking is feasible either by MIS or laparotomy.\n* Timeframe of < 6 weeks (42 days) from the last cycle of NACT to interval debulking surgery. Overall timeframe may be extended per MD Anderson PI discretion.\n* ECOG performance status 0-2\n* Signed informed consent and ability to comply with follow-up\n* Negative pregnancy test by blood or urine (within 14 days prior to surgery)\n* Disease free of other active malignancies in the previous five years, except basal and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be FEMALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
