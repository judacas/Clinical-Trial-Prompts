    "official_title": "Effects of Simulated Solar Radiation on Human Skin",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Ages 18-100 years. The investigators anticipate recruiting few if any patients over age 80 as nevi tend to disappear as people age. Both men and women of all races and ethnic groups will be included\n* Participants must have 2 clinically benign melanocytic nevi 3-5 mm in diameter confirmed by clinical dermatoscopic examination by a medically-qualified study team member and suitable for biopsy (i.e. not at a site that would be functionally or cosmetically damaged by the biopsy). The minimum size restriction arises from the need for collection of tissue sufficient for single nucleus ribonucleic acid sequencing (RNAseq) analysis. The maximum size is dictated by the requirement that the entire nevus be removed with a 6 mm punch biopsy, thereby eliminating any concerns that might arise from regrowth of the nevus that can happen after incomplete removal\n* All participants must be able to understand and be willing to sign a written informed consent document\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 100 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Undergoing systemic therapy for melanoma or any other cancer\n* Sensitivity to anesthetic agent\n* Photosensitivity\n* Currently taking supplements such as nicotinamide or antioxidants that might protect from skin cancer or alter the response of their skin to simulated solar radiation (SSR)",
