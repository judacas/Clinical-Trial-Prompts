    "official_title": "A Phase 1/2 Study of Gemcitabine and Docetaxel in Combination With Hydroxychloroquine (Autophagy Inhibitor) in Patients With Recurrent Osteosarcoma",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Patient or patient's legally acceptable representative has provided informed consent\n* Patients must have a pathological diagnosis of osteosarcoma at original diagnosis or time of recurrence\n* Patients must have relapsed or become refractory to conventional therapy, with a regimen containing some combination of high dose methotrexate, doxorubicin, cisplatin, and/or ifosfamide\n* Patients may have either unresectable or potentially resectable disease. However, patients with potentially resectable disease must be willing to await surgery until after the primary efficacy endpoint is reached at 4 months\n* Patients must have measurable disease by RECIST 1.1\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of =< 2. Use Karnofsky for patients > 16 years old and Lansky for patients =< 16\n* Has archived tumor tissue and is willing to provide a tumor block or unstained slides or the patient is willing to undergo a pretreatment biopsy. Biopsy during cycle #2 of therapy is required. Biopsy at progression is strongly encouraged but will be optional\n* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >= 1.0 x 10^9/L\n* Platelet count >= 100 x 10^9/L\n* Hemoglobin > 8 g/dL\n* Prothrombin time (PT) or partial thromboplastin time (PTT) < 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN), except subjects on anticoagulation for venous thromboembolism\n* Calculated creatinine clearance or radioisotope glomerular filtration rate (GFR) > 60 mL/min\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) < 2.5 x ULN for age\n* Total bilirubin < 1.5 x ULN for age\n* Serum albumin >= 2\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 12 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Any disorder that compromises the ability of the patient or patient's legally acceptable representative to give written informed consent and/or to comply with the study procedures\n* Patients who will not be available for protocol required study visits, to the best of the subject and investigator's knowledge\n* History of hypersensitivity to any of the study agents (gemcitabine, docetaxel, or hydroxychloroquine) or to any component of the formulation\n* Patients who have previously received gemcitabine or docetaxel\n* Men and woman of reproductive potential, unwilling to practice a highly effective method of birth control for the duration of the study and continuing for 2 weeks (for women) and 12 weeks (for men) after receiving the last dose of study drug. Highly effective methods of birth control include sexual abstinence (men, women); vasectomy or a condom used with spermicide (men) in combination with barrier methods, hormonal birth control or intrauterine device (IUD) (women)\n* Women who are lactating/breastfeeding or planning to become pregnant during the duration of the study\n* History or current diagnosis of a second neoplasm. Exception: adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer, curatively treated in-situ disease, or other solid tumors curatively treated with no evidence of disease for >= 2 years\n* Myocardial infarction within 6 months of study day 1, symptomatic congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association > class II), unstable angina, or unstable cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication, or uncontrolled hypertension (systolic > 160 mmHg or diastolic > 100 mmHg)\n* Active infection requiring intravenous (IV) antibiotics within 2 weeks of study enrollment\n* Significant gastrointestinal disorder(s) that in the opinion of the investigator (e.g., Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, extensive gastrointestinal resection) may influence drug absorption\n* Known positive test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\n* Subjects with acute hepatitis B and C are not eligible. Subjects with chronic hepatitis B or C are eligible if their condition is stable and, in the opinion of the investigator and Amgen physician, if consulted, would not pose a risk to subject safety\n* Toxicities from prior anti-tumor therapy not resolved to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade 0 or 1, or to levels dictated in the eligibility criteria. Grade 2 toxicities from prior anti-tumor therapy that are considered irreversible (defined as having been present and stable for > 4 weeks), such as stable grade 2 peripheral neuropathy or ifosfamide-related proteinuria, may be allowed if they are not otherwise described in the exclusion criteria AND there is agreement to allow by the principal investigator\n* Prior participation in an investigational study and/or procedure within 21 days of study day 1\n* Anti-tumor therapy within 21 days of study day 1 including chemotherapy, antibody therapy, or other investigational agent. Enrollment of subjects that have received molecularly targeted agents less than 28 days prior to study day 1 will be permitted if more than 14 days and at least 5 drug half-lives have passed prior to receiving the first dose of HCQ\n* Major surgery within 28 days of study day 1\n* Any co-morbid medical disorder that may increase the risk of toxicity, in the opinion of the investigator\n* All herbal supplements, vitamins, and nutritional supplements taken within the last 30 days prior to dosing on day 1 (and continued use, if appropriate), must be reviewed and approved by the principal investigator (PI)\n* Patients with pre-existing maculopathy or retinopathy of the eye",
