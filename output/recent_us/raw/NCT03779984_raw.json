Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (eg, FluMist®) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.\n\n* Is currently participating in or has participated in a study of an investigational agent within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment. NOTE: Participants who have entered the follow-up phase of an investigational study may participate as long as it has been 4 weeks after the last dose of the previous investigational agent.\n* Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy (in dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug.\n* Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or has required active treatment within the past 3 years. NOTE: Participants with basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, well-differentiated thyroid cancer, follicular lymphoma, carcinoma in situ (e.g. breast carcinoma, cervical cancer in situ) invasive cancer derived from RRP, or other indolent malignancy not requiring active treatment are not excluded.\n* Patients with invasive squamous cell carcinoma derived from their RRP who are not considered appropriate for surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy by their treating oncology team may be considered eligible for the study.\n* History of allergic reactions (&amp;amp;gt; Grade 3) attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to pembrolizumab or lenvatinib and/or any of its excipients.\n* Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs).

The degree of tumor invasion/infiltration of major blood vessels (e.g. carotid artery) should be considered because of the potential risk of severe hemorrhage associated with tumor shrinkage/necrosis following lenvatinib therapy.\n* Has &amp;amp;gt;1+ proteinuria on urine dipstick testing unless a 24-hour urine collection for quantitative assessment indicates that the urine protein is &amp;amp;lt; 1g/24 hours.\n* Has clinically significant gastrointestinal malabsorption syndrome or any other condition that might affect the absorption of lenvatinib.\n* Has a known history of colitis.\n* Has preexisting &amp;gt; Grade 3 gastrointestinal or non-gastrointestinal fistula\n* Active hemoptysis (bright red blood of at least 0.5 teaspoon) within 3 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug.\n* Has a known history of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES).\n* Participants with history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the subject's participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.\n* Participants with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the study, starting with the screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with pembrolizumab and/or lenvatinib, and breastfeeding should be discontinued.",
