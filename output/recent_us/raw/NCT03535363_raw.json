Participants with transformed FL are eligible, provided DLBCL or HGBL-DH/TH histology is biopsy-confirmed prior to study entry and a treatment regimen as described above has been administered. The Sponsor retains the option to limit the number of participants enrolled with transformed FL.\n\nPart 2, Group 2: Patients identified with DE-DLBCL (expression MYC ≥40%, BCL2 > 50%) and or HGBL-DH/TH, relapsed or refractory to >= 1 course of chemotherapy including an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, and not eligible for ASCT (including due to chemorefractory disease). Patients with transformed follicular lymphoma (FL) are eligible, provided DE-DLBCL and/or HGBL-DH/TH histology is biopsy-confirmed prior to study entry and a treatment regimen as described above has been administered. The Sponsor retains the option to limit the number of participants enrolled with transformed FL.\n\n* Part 1 and Part 2: Willing to provide the protocol specified tumor biopsy(ies): at screening a fresh biopsy (if no archival biopsy tissue of less than 3 months prior to treatment and without intercurrent treatment is available); Part 2: Willing to provide an additional biopsy on Cycle 2 Day 15 (+ 2 days).\n* Acceptable liver function, as specified below:\n\n  * Total bilirubin ≤ 2 times upper limit of normal (ULN). (Participants with known Gilbert's disease who has serum bilirubin ≤ 3 × ULN may be enrolled).\n  * Aspartate transaminase (AST; SGOT), alanine transaminase (ALT; SGPT) ≤ 2.5 × ULN, (or ≤ 5 × ULN if tumor involvement (liver) is present).\n  * Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 × ULN.\n* Acceptable renal function, as specified below:\n\n  • Creatinine clearance (CrCl) calculated by Cockroft-Gault formula of ≥ 60 mL/min.\n* Acceptable hematologic status (growth factors cannot be used within the previous 7 days), as specified below:\n\n  * Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1000 cells/μL\n  * Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL\n  * Platelet count ≥ 75,000 (platelets/μL)\n* Uncontrolled symptomatic hypercalcemia.\n* Acceptable coagulation status, as specified below:\n\n  * Prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) ≤ 1.2 × ULN (unless receiving anticoagulation therapy, if receiving anticoagulation therapy, eligibility will be based upon international normalized ratio [INR]).\n  * INR ≤ 1.6 (unless receiving anticoagulation therapy).\n  * If receiving warfarin: INR ≤ 3.0 and no active bleeding (i.e., no bleeding within 14 days prior to first dose of study therapy).\n* Acceptable method of contraception\n\nExclusion Criteria\n\n* Current central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma or leptomeningeal infiltration.\n* New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV cardiac disease, myocardial infarction, within the past 6 months, unstable arrhythmia, or known pericardial disease.\n* Fredericia-corrected QT interval (QTcF) >470 msec (female) or >450 msec (male), or history of congenital long QT syndrome.\n* Any electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormality, which in the opinion of the Investigator would preclude safe participation in the study.\n* Active, uncontrolled bacterial, viral, or fungal infections, within 7 days of study entry requiring systemic therapy.\n* Clinically important respiratory impairment\n* Grade ≥ 3 sensory or motor neuropathy.\n* Any Grade >1 (according to the NCI CTCAE 4.03) adverse reaction unresolved from previous treatments and not readily managed and controlled with supportive care.\n* Serious non-malignant disease that could compromise protocol objectives in the opinion of the Investigator and/or the Sponsor.\n* History of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML).\n* History of other malignancy within 2 years prior to screening, except for ductal carcinoma in situ not requiring chemotherapy, appropriately treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix, non-melanoma skin carcinoma, low-grade, localized prostate cancer (Gleason score ≤ 7) not requiring treatment or appropriately treated Stage I uterine cancer.\n* Completion of ASCT within 100 days prior to Day 1 of Cycle1.\n* Prior standard or investigational anti-cancer therapy, as specified below:\n\n  * Radio-immunoconjugate 4 weeks or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer prior to Day 1 of Cycle 1.\n  * Monoclonal antibody or antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) therapy within 3 weeks prior to Day 1 of Cycle 1.\n  * Radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or targeted small-molecule therapy within 2 weeks prior to Day 1 of Cycle 1.\n  * CAR T-cell therapy 30 days prior to Day 1 of Cycle 1.\n* History of major solid organ transplant (i.e., heart, lungs, liver and kidney).\n* History of an allogeneic bone marrow transplant.\n* Major surgical procedure within 28 days prior to Day 1 of Cycle 1.\n* Treatment with systemic corticosteroids ≥ 20 mg/day prednisone or equivalent, for non-lymphoma treatment reasons.
