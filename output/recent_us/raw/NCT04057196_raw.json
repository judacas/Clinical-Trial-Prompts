Participant has International Prognostic Index (IPI) score 0-5 in Part 1 and IPI 2-5 in Part 2. For the CELMoD and polatuzumab-R-CHP cohort, the subject must also have IPI score 0 to 5 in Part 2A and IPI 2 to 5 in Part 2B.\n  4. Participants must have measurable disease defined by at least one FDG-avid lesion for FDG-avid subtype and one bi-dimensionally measurable (> 1.5 cm in longest diameter) disease by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), as defined by the Lugano classification (Cheson, 2014).\n  5. Participant has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1, or 2.\n  6. Participants must have the following laboratory values:\n\n     1.

    "exclusion_criteria": "* The presence of any of the following will exclude a participant from enrollment:\n\n  1. Any significant medical condition, active infection (including SARS-CoV-2 suspected or confirmed), laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric illness that would prevent the participant from participating in the study.\n  2. Any condition including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which places the participant at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study.\n  3. Any other subtype of lymphoma.\n  4. Documented or suspected CNS involvement by lymphoma.\n  5. Persistent diarrhea or malabsorption ≥ Grade 2 (NCI CTCAE v5.0), despite medical management.\n  6. Peripheral neuropathy ≥ Grade 2 (NCI CTCAE v5.0).\n  7. Subjects with a history of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.\n  8. Chronic systemic immunosuppressive therapy or corticosteroids\n  9. Impaired cardiac function or clinically significant cardiac disease, including any of the following:\n\n     a. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 45% as determined by multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan or echocardiogram (ECHO)\n  10.
