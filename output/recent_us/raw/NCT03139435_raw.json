    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Provide written consent on an Informed Consent Form (ICF), approved by an Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC), prior to any study-specific evaluation.

Female patients must be nonlactating and have a negative serum pregnancy test result at screening and baseline.\n4. Male patients must agree to use effective contraception (must agree to use 2 forms of contraception, 1 of which must be a barrier method) for the duration of study participation and for 6 months after the final dose of study drug.\n5. Have a histologic or cytologic diagnosis of malignant solid tumor for which there are no standard of care treatment options known to confer a clinical benefit or for which the patient is ineligible or declines.\n\n   A. For Phase 1 dose escalation: histologic or cytologic diagnosis of malignant solid tumor of any type. The Sponsor may remove specific tumor indications based on emerging, real-time study data.\n\n   B. For Phase 1b dose expansion:\n\n   i. Cohort A: Histologic or cytologic diagnosis of NSLC (adenocarcinoma and SCC).\n\n   ii. Cohort B: Histologic or cytologic diagnosis of TNBC or HR positive, HER2 negative breast cancer.\n\n   iii. Cohort C: Histologic or cytologic diagnosis of the following advanced metastatic solid tumors refractory to standard treatment: pancreatic adenocarcinoma, gastric adenocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, ovarian adenocarcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma including, but not limited to, primary malignancies of the head and neck, esophagus, cervix, and skin. The Sponsor may add or remove specific tumor indications based on emerging, real-time study results.\n6. Availability of a tumor tissue sample (formalin-fixed paraffin embedded [FFPE]) must be confirmed for analysis of EphA5 expression based on IHC. Tumor biopsies are not required and should not be performed to assess eligibility.\n\n   A. For Dose Escalation (Phase 1) and Dose Expansion (Phase 1b), tumor EphA5 expression will not be required for enrollment.\n7. For Dose Escalation (Phase 1), patients may have evaluable disease or measurable disease according to RECIST v1.1). For Dose Expansion (Phase 1b) and Phase 2, patients must have measurable disease according to RECIST v1.1.\n8. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 2.\n9. Life expectancy ≥ 3 months as assessed by the investigator.\n10. Hematologic function, as follows (no red blood cell [RBC] or platelet transfusions are allowed within 14 days of the first dose of MBRC-101):\n\n    A. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.0 × 109/L B. Platelet count ≥ 100 × 109/L C. Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL\n11. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 30 mL/min by the CKD-EPI or similar equation or as measured by 24-hour urine collection.\n12. Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × upper limit normal (ULN).\n13. AST ≤ 3.0 × ULN.\n14. ALT ≤ 3.0 × ULN.\n15. International normalised ratio (INR) < 1.5 (or ≤ 3.0 if on therapeutic anticoagulation).\n16. Treatment with other agents for cancer, if received, must have been discontinued ≥ 2 weeks prior to first dose of study drug.\n\nPrior ADC therapy is allowed. Prior agents conjugated to MMAE are allowed for Phase 1 but not for Phase 1b or Phase 2. These exclusionary agents include brentuximab vedotin, polatuzumab vedotin, enfortumab vedotin, disitamab vedotin, tisotumab vedotin, and any MMAE-conjugated agents approved subsequent to the publication of this Protocol.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Preexisting sensory neuropathy Grade ≥ 2.\n2. Preexisting motor neuropathy Grade ≥ 2.\n3. Uncontrolled central nervous system metastases.\n4. Use of any investigational drug within 14 days prior to the first dose of study drug.\n5. Any anticancer therapy within 14 days prior to the first dose of study drug, including: small molecules, immunotherapy, chemotherapy, monoclonal antibody therapy, radiotherapy, or any other agents to treat cancer (anti-hormonal therapy given for advanced prostate cancer or as adjuvant therapy for early stage, hormone receptor (HR) positive breast cancer is not considered cancer therapy for the purpose of this Protocol).\n6. Strong CYP3A or inducers within 14 days prior to the first dose of study drug.\n\n8. 7. Thromboembolic events and/or bleeding disorders 14 days (e.g., venous thromboembolism [VTE] or pulmonary embolism [or PE]) prior to the first dose of study drug.\n\n8. Documented history of a cerebral vascular event (stroke or transient ischemic attack), unstable angina, myocardial infarction, or cardiac symptoms (including congestive heart failure) consistent with New York Heart Association Class 3-4 within 6 months prior to the first dose of MBRC-101.\n\n9. A baseline QT (time from the beginning of the Q wave to the end of the T wave) interval as corrected by Fridericia's formula (QTcF) > 470 msec.\n\n10. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection with 1 or more of the following: A. Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDs)-defining opportunistic infection within 6 months of the start of screening; B. A change in antiretroviral therapy within 3 months of the start of screening and viral load > 500 copies/mL; C. Receiving antiretroviral therapy that may interfere with study drug; D. CD4 count < 350 at screening. 11. Active or symptomatic viral hepatitis. Patients who have been properly treated for hepatitis C infection can be included if they do not have active hepatitis C.\n\n12. Known sensitivity to any of the ingredients of the investigational product MBRC-101.\n\n13. Major surgery within 28 days prior to first dose of study drug. 14. History of another malignancy within 3 years before the first dose of study drug, or any evidence of residual disease from a previously diagnosed malignancy. Allowed exceptions are patients with: A. Non-melanoma skin cancer considered completely cured; B. Localized prostate cancer treated with curative intent with no evidence of progression; C. Low-risk or very low-risk (per standard clinical guidelines) localized prostate cancer under active surveillance without immediate intent to treat; D. Malignancy that is otherwise considered cured with minimal risk of recurrence.\n\n15. Currently receiving systemic antimicrobial treatment for active infection (bacterial, viral, or fungal) at the time of first dose of MBRC-101. Routine antimicrobial prophylaxis is permitted.\n\n16. Condition or situation which, in the investigator's opinion, may put the patient at significant risk, may confound the study results, or may interfere significantly with patient's participation in the study.\n\n17.
