Females of child-bearing potential (defined as a sexually mature woman who (1) has not undergone hysterectomy [the surgical removal of the uterus] or bilateral oophorectomy [the surgical removal of both ovaries] or (2) has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months [i.e., has had menses at any time during the preceding 24 consecutive months]) must:\n\n    1.

    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Patients must have received no previous radiotherapy, surgery, chemotherapy or investigational therapy for the treatment of metastatic disease. Prior treatments in the neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant setting with gemcitabine and/or 5-FU based therapies or gemcitabine and/or 5FU administered as a radiation sensitizer are allowed, provided at least 6 months have elapsed since completion of the last dose and no lingering toxicities are present.\n2. Palliative surgery and/or radiation treatment less than 4 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment.\n3. Exposure to any investigational agent within 4 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment.\n4.
