    "inclusion_criteria": "PARTICIPANT INCLUSION CRITERIA\n\nRECIPIENT SCREENING INCLUSION CRITERIA\n\n* Diagnosis of high-risk solid tumors known to express at least 2 targeted antigens by either histology or historical reference: Ewing sarcoma, Wilms tumor, neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, soft tissue sarcoma, and osteosarcoma.\n* HLA type and match through at least one allele with antigen-specific activity.\n* Refractory disease, residual detectable disease following conventional therapy or relapsed disease.\n* Arm A: age ≥18 years and <70 years\n* Arm B: age ≥6 years to <18 years\n* Patient or parent/guardian capable of providing informed consent.\n\nRECIPIENT INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR INITIAL TAA-T ADMINISTRATION AND FOR SUBSEQUENT INFUSION\n\n* No systemic steroid exposure within 1 week of TAA-T infusion.\n* Karnofsky/Lansky score of ≥50% (see Appendix 4).\n* Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) >50% or left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) >27% if history of total body irradiation (TBI) (may be performed within the last 6 months).\n* Hemoglobin >7.0 g/dL (level can be achieved with transfusion).\n* Bilirubin ≤2.5 mg/dL.\n* Aspartate transaminase (AST)/Alanine transaminase (ALT) ≤5 x the upper limit of normal for age.\n* Serum creatinine <1.0 mg/dL or 2x the upper limit of normal for age (whichever is higher).\n* Pulse oximetry of >90% on room air.\n* Negative pregnancy test in female patient of childbearing age.\n* Agree to use contraceptive measures during study protocol participation (when age appropriate).\n* Patients receiving lymphodepleting chemotherapy must have:\n\n  * Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >1000 /ul.\n  * Platelet count >75,000 /ul.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 6 Years\nMust have maximum age of 70 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "PARTICIPANT EXCLUSION CRITERIA RECIPIENT SCREENING EXCLUSION CRITERIA\n\n* Patients with known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.\n* Pregnant or lactating females.\n* Patients who have undergone previous allogeneic stem cell transplant.\n* Patients who have undergone previous autologous stem cell transplant within the past 60 days.\n\nRECIPIENT EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR INITIAL AND SUBSEQUENT TAA-T INFUSION\n\n* Patients with uncontrolled infections. Uncontrolled infections are defined as bacterial, fungal, or viral infections with either clinical signs of worsening despite standard therapy. Progressing infection is defined as hemodynamic instability, worsening physical signs, or radiographic findings attributable to infection. Persisting fever without other signs or symptoms will not be interpreted as progressing infection.\n\n  * For bacterial infections, patients must be receiving definitive therapy and have no signs of progressing infection within 7 days prior to TAA-T infusion.\n  * For fungal infections, patients must be receiving definitive systemic anti-fungal therapy and have no signs of progressing infection within 7 days prior to TAA-T infusion.\n* Patients who received ATG, Campath or other immunosuppressive T cell monoclonal antibodies within 28 days prior to TAA-T infusion.\n* For patients receiving lymphodepleting chemotherapy: exposure to chemotherapy or immunomodulatory medications within the last 2 weeks prior to treatment.\n* Pregnant or lactating females.",
