Male and Female patients age ≥ 18 years on day of signing informed consent.\n3. Willing to comply with all protocol-required visits, assessments, and procedures.\n4. Patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors who have had disease progression on all available standard of care or for whom no reasonable standard of care exists that would confer clinical benefit.\n5. Recovery from all toxicities associated with prior therapy to acceptable baseline status (for laboratory toxicities, see limits for inclusion). NCI CTCAE v5.0 Grade 0 or 1, except for toxicities not considered a safety risk (e.g., alopecia or vitiligo).\n6. Measurable disease per RECIST v1.1.\n7. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1 with no deterioration during Screening.\n8. Adequate bone marrow and organ function, defined by the following laboratory results obtained within 14 days before first dose of study drug.\n9. Patients with recent major surgery must have adequately recovered with no ongoing complications from the surgery prior to receiving study treatment.\n10. Willingness to adhere to the study treatment-specific contraception requirements.\n11.

    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency.\n2. Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy within 4 weeks prior to study treatment.\n3. History of or known intolerance, significant hypersensitivity, or anaphylaxis to any components of PTX-912 or any of the excipients.\n4. Unresolved toxicities from prior systemic therapy greater than NCI CTCAE grade 1 at time of first dose, except alopecia, vitiligo, and grade 2 neuropathy due to prior chemotherapy.\n5. Experienced clinically significant immune-related toxicity from prior immunotherapy that in the opinion of the investigator would preclude protocol therapy or would make the patient inappropriate for the study.\n6. Major surgery within 30 days prior to first dose of study drug (with the below exceptions), or anticipation of major surgery during study treatment.\n7. Active autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment within the past 3 months or have a documented history of clinically severe autoimmune disease that requires systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents.\n8. Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus or other uncontrolled immune-related endocrinopathies in the opinion of the investigator.\n9.

History of allogenic, bone marrow, or solid organ transplants.\n13. Received a live-virus vaccination ≤14 days prior to first dose of study drug (seasonal flu and other inactivated vaccines that do not contain live virus are permitted).\n14. Clinically significant bleeding within 2 weeks prior to first dose of study drug dy.\n15.
