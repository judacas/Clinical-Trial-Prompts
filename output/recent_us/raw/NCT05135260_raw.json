    "official_title": "An Open-Label, Multicenter, Phase 1b/2 Study to Establish Safety, Tolerability, and Optimal Dosing Strategy of GLR2007 in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors",
    "inclusion_criteria": "1. For Part 1 (Dose Escalation): Participants with advanced solid tumors who are refractory or intolerant to therapies known to provide clinical benefit.\n\n   1. For Part 1 (Dose Escalation): The participant must have histological or cytological evidence of cancer (a solid tumor) that is advanced and/or metastatic. Biopsy is allowed by protocol if no histology or cytology records are available.\n   2. For Part 2 (Dose Expansion): The participant must have histological or cytological evidence of cancer that is advanced and/or metastatic.\n2. For Part 1 (Dose Escalation): The participant has measurable or non-measurable disease.\n3. For Part 2 (Dose Expansion): The participant has measurable disease.\n4. The participant has given written informed consent prior to all study-specific procedures.\n5. The participant has adequate hematologic, hepatic, and renal function.\n6. The participant has discontinued all prior cancer therapies (including chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and investigational therapy) for at least 21 days for myelosuppressive agents or 14 days for radiotherapy and non-myelosuppressive agents, prior to receiving GLR2007, and has recovered from the acute effects of therapy (treatment related toxicity resolved to ≤Grade 1) except for residual alopecia.\n7. The participant is willing and able to make themselves available for the duration of the study and is willing and able to follow study procedures.\n8. The participant meets contraceptive requirements.\n9. The participant has an estimated life expectancy of ≥3 months.\n10. The participant agrees to minimize ultraviolet exposure and sunlight for the duration of their study participation.\n11. A diagnostic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain must be performed within 28 days prior to registration. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) is acceptable if MRI is not possible.\n\nCohort-specific inclusion criteria Part 2 (Cohort A, NSCLC)\n\n1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed NSCLC.\n2. Participants must have received at least 1 line of standard therapy for metastatic disease, including platinum-based chemotherapy and an immune checkpoint inhibitor given together or as separate lines of therapy, unless participants are ineligible for or cannot tolerate such therapy.\n3. Participants with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase ROS (ROS1), v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF), and neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase 1 (NTRK) aberrations must have received therapy directed at their molecular aberration in order to enroll on this study.\n\nPart 2 (Cohort B, Brain metastases of breast or NSCLC origin)\n\n1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed NSCLC or breast cancer at primary site.\n2. Participants with inoperable brain metastases (prior radiation therapy and/or stereotactic radiosurgery is allowed). A neurosurgical consult is at the discretion of the investigator.\n3. Participants with brain metastases of NSCLC origin must have received at least 1 line of standard therapy for metastatic disease, including platinum-based chemotherapy and an immune checkpoint inhibitor given together or as separate lines of therapy, unless participants are ineligible for or cannot tolerate such therapy.\n4. Participants with ALK, EGFR, ROS1, BRAF, and NTRK aberrations must have received therapy directed at their molecular aberration in order to enroll on this study.\n5. Participants with brain metastases from breast cancer who have previously received CDK4/6 inhibitors.\n\nPart 2 (Cohort C, GBM)\n\n1. Histologically confirmed diagnosis of a recurrent primary World Health Organization Grade IV malignant glioblastoma. Participants with recurrent disease whose diagnostic pathology confirmed glioblastoma will not need re-biopsy. Participants with prior low-grade glioma or anaplastic glioma are eligible if histologic assessment demonstrates transformation to GBM.\n2. First recurrence of GBM.\n3. Candidate for surgical partial or gross-total resection.\n4. Radiographic demonstration of disease progression by contrast-enhanced CT or MRI following prior therapy.\n5. At least 2 weeks between prior surgical resection and adequate wound healing.\n6. At least 12 weeks from prior radiotherapy unless there is either histopathologic confirmation of recurrent tumor or new enhancement on MRI outside of the treatment field.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. The participant has a personal history of any of the following conditions: major surgical resection involving the stomach or small bowel recurrent, unexplained or cardiac-related syncopal episodes within the last 6 months or ventricular arrhythmia (including but not limited to ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation).\n2. Any concurrent malignancies currently requiring treatment or for which treatment would be deemed necessary within 3 months of enrollment; prostate cancer with androgen deprivation therapy, basal cell cancer, and squamous cell cancers are allowed.\n3. The participant is pregnant or lactating.\n4. The participant is immunocompromised and known to be human immunodeficiency virus positive. The participant has an active bacterial, fungal, and/or known viral infection (for example, hepatitis B surface antigen or hepatitis C antibodies).\n\nCohort-specific exclusion criteria:\n\nPart 2 (Cohort A, NSCLC): The participant has NSCLC with worsening symptoms within 14 days prior to receiving GLR2007.\n\nPart 2 (Cohort B, Brain metastases of breast or NSCLC origin): The participant has CNS metastasis with worsening symptoms within 14 days prior to receiving GLR2007.\n\nPart 2 (Cohort C, GBM): The participant has GBM with worsening symptoms within 14 days prior to receiving GLR2007.",
