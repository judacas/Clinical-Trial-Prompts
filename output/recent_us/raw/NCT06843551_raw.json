    "official_title": "A Randomized Trial of Early, Upfront Palliative Radiation Therapy Versus Standard of Care for Patients With Highest Risk Asymptomatic or Minimally Symptomatic Bone Metastases",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Histologically confirmed solid tumor malignancy with greater than 5 sites of metastatic disease detected on imaging.\n* Has high risk bone metastases that are asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic (not requiring opioids). High risks metastases are defined as: 1. bulkiest sites of osseous disease ≥ 2cm, 2. disease involving the hip (acetabulum, femoral head, femoral neck), shoulder (acromion, glenoid, humeral head), or sacroiliac joints 3. disease in long bones with1/3-2/3 cortical thickness (humerus, radius, ulna, clavicle, femur, tibia, fibula, metacarpus, phalanges) 4. disease in junctional spine (C7-T1, T12-L1, L5-S1) and/or disease with posterior element involvement.\n* ECOG performance status 0 - 2.\n* Age ≥ 18 years.\n* Able to provide informed consent.\n* Patients at reproductive potential must agree to practice an effective contraceptive method. Women of childbearing potential must not be pregnant or lactating.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Previous radiotherapy to the intended treatment site that precludes developing a treatment plan that respects normal tissue tolerances.\n* Serious medical co-morbidities precluding radiotherapy.\n* Pregnant or lactating women.\n* Target lesion(s) is/are complicated bone metastases that include clinical or radiological evidence of spinal cord compression or impending pathological fracture.\n* Leptomeningeal disease.\n* Malignant pleural effusion.\n* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) <1.0 K/mcL and platelet count <50 K/mcL at time of enrollment.\n* Patients whose entry to the trial will cause unacceptable clinical delays in their planned management.",
