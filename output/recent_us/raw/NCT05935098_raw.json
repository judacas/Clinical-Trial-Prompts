    "exclusion_criteria": "* Known uncontrolled brain metastases. Stable brain metastases either treated or being treated with a stable dose of steroids/anticonvulsants, with no dose change in the previous 4 weeks, are permitted\n* Active fungal, bacterial and/or known viral infection including HIV or Hepatitis A, B, C\n* Concomitant malignancies or previous malignancies with less than 2 years disease-free interval at the time of enrollment, with the exception of non-metastatic, non-melanomatous skin cancers, carcinoma in-situ, melanoma in-situ, prostate cancer with undetectable PSA, indolent thyroid cancer that are adequately treated\n* Has clinically significant (ie, active) cardiovascular disease: cerebral vascular accident/stroke (< 6 months prior to enrollment), myocardial infarction (< 6 months prior to enrollment), unstable angina, congestive heart failure (> New York Heart Association Classification Class II), QTc ≥ 470 msec, or serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication\n* Uncontrolled or severe intercurrent medical condition\n* Gastrointestinal condition that could impair absorption of study intervention or inability to ingest study intervention\n* In the judgement of the investigator, any important medical illness or abnormal laboratory finding that would increase the risk of participating in this study\n* Received any cancer directed therapy (chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, biologic, etc.) within 28 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is shorter) of starting study intervention. For Arm 7 (NRAS Q61 mutated anaplastic thyroid cancer) in Part B (Expansion), participants who have received radio-sensitizing chemotherapy (low-dose chemotherapy) are permitted a wash-out period of 7 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter (a discussion with the sponsor is required).
