    "exclusion_criteria": "* Receipt of a previous allogeneic HSCT.\n* Received allogeneic HSCT with ex-vivo graft manipulation, in vivo T cell depletion with alemtuzumab, or haploidentical allogeneic HSCT with high dose anti-thymocyte globulin.\n* Received allogeneic HSCT for multiple myeloma or, for participants ≥18 years of age only, for any nonmalignant diseases except sickle cell disease and aplastic anemia.\n* Persistent or relapsed primary disease after allogeneic HSCT.\n* History of severe GVHD (Grade 3 or 4 GVHD) after allogeneic HSCT.\n* Planned organ transplantation after allogeneic HSCT.\n* History of culture-positive pneumococcal disease occurring after allogeneic HSCT.\n* Known hypersensitivity to any component of pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, or any diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccine.\n* History of acquired immunodeficiency such as documented HIV infection, or anatomic asplenia.\n* Coagulation disorder contraindicating intramuscular vaccinations.\n* Severe hepatic impairment (defined as Child-Pugh Class C) at Screening.\n* Serum aspartate transaminase (AST) or alanine transaminase (ALT) >6 × upper limit of normal (ULN) or serum total bilirubin >2.5 × ULN at Screening.\n* A WOCBP who has a positive urine or serum pregnancy test before the 1st vaccination.\n* Received chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy or checkpoint inhibitor directed therapy (i.e., anti-Programmed Cell Death (PD)-1) after allogeneic HSCT.\n* Received or planned to receive anti-Cluster of Differentiation (CD) 20 B-cell targeted therapy (e.g., rituximab) after allogeneic HSCT.\n* Non-study pneumococcal vaccine administered after allogeneic HSCT, or is expected to receive non-study pneumococcal vaccine during participation in the study.\n* Is currently participating or has participated in an interventional clinical study with an investigational compound/agent or device within 2 weeks of participating in this current study, or plans to receive any investigational compound/agent or device (in addition to existing therapy) within 2 weeks of any vaccination, that in the opinion of the investigator would interfere with the evaluation of the study objectives.\n* Is, at the time of signing informed consent, a user of recreational or illicit drugs or has had a recent history (within the last year) of drug or alcohol abuse or dependence as assessed by the study investigator.\n* Has history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, laboratory test result abnormality, or other circumstance that might expose the participant to risk by participating in the study, confound the results of the study, or interfere with the participant's participation for the full duration of the study.\n* Is or has an immediate family member who is investigational site or Sponsor staff directly involved with this study.",
