    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Signed Informed Consent Form\n2. Age ≥ 18 years at time of signing Informed Consent Form\n3. Histologically or cytologically confirmed squamous cell carcinoma\n4. Measurable disease per RECIST v1 .1 • Note that protocol specified imaging is not necessary to fulfill this criterion. For example, a patient presenting with a visible 4cm primary lesion who has obviously RECIST evaluable disease may be considered eligible prior to baseline imaging stipulated in the protocol.\n5. Availability of a representative tumor specimen that is suitable for determination of PD-L 1 immunohistochemical stain evaluation.\n6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 or 1\n7. Adequate hematologic and end-organ function appropriate for surgery as determined by routine preoperative evaluation. If liver function, renal function and hematologic laboratory test results are within limits acceptable for elective surgery.\n\n   Laboratory results that will need to be obtained within 28 days prior to initiation of study treatment:\n\n   • Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), Alanine aminotransferas (ALT), total bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) ≤ 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN.).\n\n   • Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) < 13\n\n   • Patients with a history of a high TSH who are receiving levothyroxine replacement at the time of eligibility evaluation and have no clinical evidence of hypothyroidism are eligible.\n8. For patients receiving therapeutic anticoagulation: stable anticoagulant regimen\n9. Negative hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) test at screening\n10. For women of childbearing potential: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive methods, as defined below: Women must remain abstinent or use contraceptive methods with a failure rate of < 1 % per year during the treatment period and for 5 months after the final dose of atezolizumab. A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarchal, has not reached a postmenopausal state 3 (12 continuous months of amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone surgical sterilization (removal of ovaries and/or uterus). The definition of childbearing potential may be adapted for alignment with local guidelines or requirements. Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of< 1 % per year include bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, hormonal contraceptives that inhibit ovulation, hormone-releasing intrauterine devices, and copper intrauterine devices. The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation\n11. For men: Agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use a condom, and agreement to refrain from donating sperm, as defined below: With a female partner of childbearing potential or pregnant female partner, men must agree to remain abstinent or use a condom during the treatment period and for 5 months after the final dose of atezolizumab to avoid exposing the embryo.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Patients not eligible for standard of care surgical resection\n2. Distant metastatic disease\n3. Uncontrolled pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, or ascites requiring recurrent drainage procedures (once monthly or more frequently) • Patients with indwelling catheters (e.g., PleurX) are allowed.\n4. Uncontrolled or symptomatic hypercalcemia (ionized calcium > 1.5 mmol/L, calcium > 12 mg/dl or corrected serum calcium > ULN)\n5.

Treatment with therapeutic oral or IV antibiotics within 2 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment\n\n* Patients receiving prophylactic antibiotics (e.g., to prevent a urinary tract infection or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation) are eligible for the study.\n\n  11. Prior allogeneic stem cell or solid organ transplantation\n\n  12. Any other disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding that contraindicates the use of an investigational drug, may affect the interpretation of the results, or may render the patient at high risk from treatment complications\n\n  13. Treatment with a live, attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment, or anticipation of need for such a vaccine during atezolizumab treatment or within 5 months after the final dose of atezolizumab\n\n  14.
