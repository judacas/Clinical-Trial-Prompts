    "exclusion_criteria": "* Subjects with a history of myocardial infarction, angina, congestive heart failure exacerbation, hospitalization for cardiac etiology, stroke or transient ischemic attack in the past 12 months.\n* Neurologic, musculoskeletal, osteoarthritis, or any other condition that in the opinion of the investigator limits subject's ability to complete study physical assessments.\n* Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones).\n* Subjects with a history of cholecystectomy.\n* Subjects with a history of malignancy that is not in complete remission for at least 2 years or 1 year for non-melanoma skin carcinoma.\n* Subjects with a family history of early onset prostate cancer or familial prostate cancer (multiple family members).\n* Diseases known to cause malabsorption of protein or energy, such as inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, pancreatic insufficiency, etc.\n* Current or planned administration of cholestyramine or strong oral or injectable cytochrome P-450 isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4) inducers.\n* Current or planned use of any prescription drugs known to affect muscle mass, including androgen supplements, anti-androgens (such as luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone [LHRH] agonists), anti-estrogens (tamoxifen, etc.), recombinant growth hormone, megesterol, etc.\n* Use of oral steroids concurrently or within 4 weeks preceding the screening visit.\n* The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational product within the following time-period prior to randomization in the current study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the investigational product (whichever is longer).\n* Subjects with values outside the specified ranges for the following Key Clinical Laboratory Tests must be excluded from the study: a) Renal function: Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) <30 milliliter per minute per 1.73 meter square (mL/min/1.73 m^2). Subjects receiving dialysis are excluded from this study. b) Metabolic-glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) >7.5%. c) ALT >2 times upper limit of normal (ULN) and bilirubin >1.5 times ULN (isolated bilirubin >1.5 times ULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin <35%). d) Hematology - Hemoglobin <10.0 grams per deciliter (g/dL) at screening. e) Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) >4.0 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL).\n* Presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), positive hepatitis C antibody test result at screening or within 3 months prior to first dose of study treatment.\n* QT interval corrected for heart rate by Bazett's formula (QTcB) or QT interval corrected for heart rate by Fridericia's formula (QTcF) >450 milliseconds (msec) or QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) >480 msec in subjects with Bundle Branch Block based on a single ECG.\n* A positive test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody.\n* More than two moderate/severe COPD exacerbations within the past year. Exacerbation is defined as worsening of two or more of the following major symptoms: dyspnea, sputum volume, sputum purulence OR worsening of any one major symptom together with at least one of the following additional symptoms: sore throat, colds (nasal discharge and/or nasal congestion), fever >37.5 degree Celsius without any explained cause, increased cough, increased wheeze. A moderate exacerbation is defined as an exacerbation that requires treatment with antibiotics and/or oral steroids. A severe exacerbation is defined as an event that is additionally associated with hospitalization or emergency room visit.\n* Any moderate/severe COPD exacerbation in the 4 weeks preceding the screening visit.\n* Subjects on long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT), defined as prescribed continuous oxygen use for >14 hours/day.\n* Clinically diagnosed history of drug or alcohol abuse within 5 years prior to randomization.\n* History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.\n* Participation in a formal pulmonary rehabilitation exercise program outside or inside the home, either currently or completed within the previous 6 months.\n* For subjects who opt to have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at participating study sites, there must be no contraindications to MRI, for example known claustrophobia or a pacemaker. Specific MRI contraindications will be determined by the type of MRI scanner available at each site and study personnel should confirm local eligibility requirements.",
