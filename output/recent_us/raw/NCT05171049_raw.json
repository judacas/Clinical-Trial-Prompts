Has no history of another primary malignancy, with the exception of:\n\n   1. Malignancy treated with curative intent and with no known active disease ≥ 3 years before the first dose of study drug and of low potential risk for recurrence.\n   2. Adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer or lentigo maligna without evidence of disease and superficial bladder cancer.\n8. Patients must provide a sufficient and adequate FFPE tumor tissue sample preferably from the most recent biopsy of a tumor lesion, collected either at the time of or after the diagnosis of advanced or metastatic disease has been made AND from a site not previously irradiated. Archival tumor tissue must be ≤ 3 years old. If no tumor tissue is available, a fresh biopsy will be required (See Section 7.2.3.1 for details).\n\n   Note: Tissue from core biopsy or excisional biopsy or from resection is required.\n9. Patients must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening (within 72 hours of first dose of study medication) if of childbearing potential or be of non-childbearing potential. Non-childbearing potential is defined as (by other than medical reasons):\n\n   1. ≥45 years of age and has not had menses for greater than 1 year,\n   2. Amenorrheic ≥ 2 years without a hysterectomy and oophorectomy and a follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) value in the postmenopausal range upon pretrial (screening) evaluation,\n   3. History of hysterectomy, oophorectomy or tubal ligation.\n   4. Definitive pelvic radiation for the treatment of cervical cancer.\n10. If of childbearing potential, female patients must be willing to use 2 adequate barrier methods throughout the study, starting with the screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of study treatment. Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the established and preferred contraception for the patient.\n11. Is willing and able to comply with the requirements of the protocol.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be FEMALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "The patient must be excluded from participating in the trial if the patient:\n\n1. Is currently participating and receiving study therapy or has participated in a study of an investigational agent and received study therapy or used an investigation device within 4 weeks of the first dose of treatment.\n2. Has an inadequate washout period prior to first dose of study drug defined as:\n\n   1. Received systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy or biological therapy within 3 weeks before first dose,\n   2. Received radiation therapy within 3 weeks before first dose, or\n   3. Had major surgery within 4 weeks before first dose.\n3. Has received prior therapy with:\n\n   1.

Has known severe hypersensitivity reactions to fully human monoclonal antibodies (NCI-CTCAE Grade ≥3), any history of anaphylaxis, or uncontrolled asthma.\n7. Has received systemic corticosteroid therapy ≤ 7 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment or receiving any other form of systemic immunosuppressive medication (corticosteroid use on study for management of immune-related adverse events (AE), and/or a premedication for IV contrast allergies/reactions is allowed). Patients who are receiving daily corticosteroid replacement therapy are an exception to this rule. Daily prednisone at doses of up to 5 mg or equivalent hydrocortisone dose are examples of permitted replacement therapy.\n8.
