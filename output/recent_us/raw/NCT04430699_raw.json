    "inclusion_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria\n\n1) Signed Written Informed Consent\n\n1. Participants must have signed and dated an IRB/IEC approved written informed consent form in accordance with regulatory and institutional guidelines. This must be obtained before the performance of any protocol related procedures that are not part of normal participant care.\n2. Participants must be willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment schedule, laboratory testing, tumor biopsies, and other requirements of the study.\n3. All consented participants should be registered in the institutional database CORe 2) Type of Participant and Target Disease Characteristics\n\n   Cohort 1:\n\n   Melanoma (n=35 patients)\n   1. Histologically confirmed stage III (unresectable) or stage IV melanoma, as per American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Version 8 staging system (Appendix A). Patients must consent to BRAF testing or have documented BRAF status as per regionally acceptable V600 mutational status testing. Specifically, 10 melanoma patients will be initially enrolled, and an additional 25 melanoma patients will be enrolled in expansion cohort. Patients with biopsiable disease will have tissue collected including patients in the expansion cohorts. Archival tumor tissue samples may be collected in place of the biopsy after PI consultation. If biopsy is not feasible, or the patient declines to participate due to the biopsy, the patient may still enroll with PI approval.\n   2. Treatment-naïve participants (ie, no prior systemic anticancer therapy for unresectable or metastatic melanoma) with the exception of prior adjuvant treatment for melanoma with approved agents (eg, BRAF/MEK inhibitors, ipilimumab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab or interferon). Participants who have had recurrence within the 6 months of completing adjuvant treatment are not eligible.\n\n   Cohort 2:\n\n   Urothelial Carcinoma (n=10 patients) 1. Histologically or cytologically documented locally advanced or transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelium including renal pelvis, ureters, urinary bladder, or urethra. Patients with mixed histologies are required to have a dominant transitional cell pattern.\n\n   2. Enrollment of urothelial carcinoma 1st line patients who are cisplatin-ineligible and who, after consultation with the investigator, choose to forego front-line chemotherapy or immunotherapy.\n\n   3. Treatment naïve, cisplatin-eligible patients who refuse chemotherapy standard of care or treatment naive, cisplatin-ineligible patients who meet at least one of the following criteria:\n\n   - Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5 Grade ≥ 2 audiometric hearing loss. CTCAE v5 Grade ≥ 2 peripheral neuropathy.\n   * Cisplatin ineligibility defined as: GFR less than 60 and ≥ 15 mL/min or; CHF NYHA class III or higher or; peripheral neuropathy grade 2 or higher or ECOG PS 2 or higher or; impaired hearing grade 2 or higher.\n   * GFR is either measured using a 24 hour urine, calculated using Cockroft-Gault, or estimated using the MDRD method from the National Kidney Disease Education Program (NKDEP) (the method reported by MDACC laboratories).\n\n     a. Cockroft-Gault formula: CLcr = [(140-age) • wt(kg)]/[72 •Creat (mg/dL)] (Multiply by 0.85 for females).\n\n     4. No prior chemotherapy for inoperable locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma.\n\n     5. Prior local intravesical chemotherapy is allowed if completed at least 4 weeks prior to the initiation of study treatment.\n\n     6. For patients who received prior adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemo-radiation for urothelial carcinoma, a treatment-free interval of more than 12 months between the last treatment administration and the date of recurrence is required to be considered treatment naive in the metastatic setting. Patients must not have received neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy with any immuno-oncology regimens. Please note that this small population of patients will be excluded.\n\n   Cohort 3: (n=10 patients)\n   1. Subjects diagnosed with histologically or cytologically confirmed locally advanced/metastatic NSCLC with EGFR mutation known to be associated with EGFR TKI sensitivity (including G719X, exon 19 deletion, L858R, L861Q).\n   2. Subjects must have received one prior line of therapy with an EGFR TKI in the locally advanced/metastatic setting.\n   3. Subjects need to meet either A or B. A) Must have received and progressed on an approved first or second generation EGFR TKI (eg, erlotinib or gefitinib [first generation] or afatinib [second generation]) and must be T790M negative by an approved testing assay on tumor biopsy at the time of progression. B) Patient must have received third generation TKI Osimertinib and progressed on this therapy for study entry. C) TKI needs to be the last therapy. D) Prior chemotherapy received in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant settings will not be considered a line of therapy.\n\n   Common Inclusion Criteria for all three Cohorts\n\n   1. Participants must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status less than or equal to 1 (adults 18 years or older).\n\n   2. Measurable disease by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) per RECIST 1.1 criteria.\n\n   3. Participants with stable brain metastases <=3cm, with no clinical requirement for local intervention (surgery, radiosurgery, corticosteroid therapy) or other systemic therapy are allowed to enroll. Subjects must be free of neurologic signs and symptoms related to metastatic intracranial lesions and must not have required or received systemic corticosteroid therapy within 10 days prior to first treatment.\n\n   4. All participants must have tissue submitted during screening. Either a formalin-fixed, paraffin- embedded (FFPE) tissue block or unstained tumor tissue sections, obtained within 3 months prior to enrollment. Biopsy should be excisional, incisional, punch biopsy, core needle or surgical specimen. Fine needle aspiration is unacceptable for submission. Biopsies of bone lesions that do not have a soft tissue component are also unacceptable for submission. If the patient refuses the biopsy, the patient may still enroll with PI approval.\n\n   5. Prior palliative radiotherapy is allowed. Radiation-related toxicities should have resolved to grade 1 or less prior to study entry. Please note that radiated lesions cannot be used as measurable lesions unless there is clear evidence of progression 6. Participants must be able and willing to comply with the study visit schedule and study procedures.\n\n   3) Age and Reproductive Status\n\n<!-- -->\n\n1. Males and females, ages 18 years or older\n2.
