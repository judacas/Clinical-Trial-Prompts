    "inclusion_criteria": "* World Health Organization (WHO)-defined acute lymphoblastic leukemia and either:\n\n  * Relapsed after achieving remission\n  * Refractory to therapy\n  * Newly diagnosed and ineligible for intensive chemotherapy induction Note: patients with T lineage and B lineage ALL are eligible for this trial; likewise, patients with Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) (as long as they are not candidate for other therapies for Ph+) and Ph- ALL are eligible\n* Bone marrow blasts of at least 10%\n* At least 4 weeks away from any previous antineoplastic or investigational agent; patients may receive hydroxyurea or glucocorticoids for suppression of leukocytosis, but these must be stopped at least 24 hours (h) prior to initiation of therapy\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =< 2\n* Life expectancy of > 2 months\n* Total bilirubin =< 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT]) =< 2.5 x institutional upper limit of normal\n* Creatinine =< 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal\n* Fasting blood glucose (FBG) < 130 mg/dL\n* Hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) < 7.0%\n* Relapse after SCT is allowed but no active graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) as per treating physician; also must not exceed the number of prior induction regimens listed above; SCT does not count as line of therapy\n* Negative serum pregnancy test result; Note: women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use 1 highly effective method of contraception and 1 additional effective (barrier) method, at the same time, from the time of signing the informed consent through 90 days (or longer, as mandated by local labeling [e.g. United States product insert (USPI), Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC), etc]) after the last does of study drug; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately; men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use highly effective barrier contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 4 months after completion of MLN0128 (TAK-228) administration\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document\n* No prior therapy with mTOR inhibitors except for rapalog treatment as part of graft-versus-host (GVH) prophylaxis or treatment\n* Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected patients (if HIV positive)\n\n  * HIV infected individuals are eligible provided they meet all the protocol eligibility criteria in addition to the following:\n\n    * No history of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) defining illness other than a historic CD4+ T-cell nadir < 200/mm^3\n    * Prior to leukemia diagnosis, the HIV disease was uncomplicated as evidenced by:\n\n      * The CD4+ T-cell counts were generally in excess of 300/mm^3\n      * The HIV viral loads were less than 200 copies/ml if on anti-HIV therapy\n      * If the HIV is newly diagnosed or there is no history of using anti-HIV therapy, there are no AIDS defining conditions or other HIV-related symptoms\n      * Zidovudine is not allowed as part of the anti-HIV therapy\n* Patients with diabetes controlled by diet or medication are allowed on trial; controlled diabetes is defined as FBG < 130 mg/kL in the context of this study\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy =< 4 weeks prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier; treatment with glucocorticoids, hydroxyurea, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors is allowed up to 24 hour prior to initiation of therapy\n* Patients with white blood cell (WBC) > 30,000 are not eligible to start therapy; however, it is permissible to use glucocorticoids and/or hydroxyurea to diminish peripheral WBC to less than 30,000 provided these agents are stopped at least 24 hours prior to the first dose of MLN0128 (TAK-228)\n* Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents\n* Patients with known other active cancers; skin cancers (basal or squamous) are exempted\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to MLN0128 (TAK-228)\n* There are no prohibitions of specific medications on the basis of anticipated drug-drug interactions\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, hypertension, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements; no ischemic myocardial or cerebrovascular event, placement of pacemaker, or pulmonary embolism within six months of receiving first dose of MLN0128 (TAK-228)\n* Any patient receiving chronic corticosteroid administration prior to study enrollment is ineligible\n* Baseline prolongation of the rate-corrected QT interval (QTc) > 480 milliseconds or history of congenital long QT syndrome or Torsades de pointes\n* Concomitant administration of any proton pump inhibitor (PPI) is not permitted during the study; patients receiving PPI therapy before enrollment must stop using the PPI for 7 days before their first dose of study drugs",
