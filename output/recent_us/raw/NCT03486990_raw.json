Hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL (red blood cell transfusions permitted provided the anemia is disease-related).\n   3. Platelet count ≥ 100 x 10^9/L and no platelet transfusions during the 7 days before first dose (without transfusions). (Dose expansion cohorts will be allowed to have platelets counts ≥ 75 x 10^9/L with no platelet transfusions during the prior 7 days).\n8. Must have at least 2 negative serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) pregnancy test result obtained prior to initiating therapy. The first test should be performed within 10-14 days and the second within 24 hours prior to initiating therapy if the patient is a female of childbearing potential (FCBP; defined as a sexually mature woman who has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months).\n9. Men and women of childbearing potential must agree to not donate sperm and eggs (ova and oocytes) throughout study therapy and for 3 months after the last treatment.\n10. Men and women agree to use acceptable contraceptive methods for the duration of time on the study, and continue to use acceptable contraceptive methods for 3 months after the last treatment with study treatment.\n\n    1. Women of childbearing potential must agree to 2 methods of reliable birth control simultaneously while receiving study treatment and until 100 days after last dose of study treatment: one highly effective form of contraception (tubal ligation, intrauterine device, hormonal [oral, injectable, transdermal patches, vaginal rings or implants] or partner's vasectomy, and 1 additional effective contraceptive method (male latex or synthetic condom, diaphragm or cervical cap).\n    2. Males must agree to always use a latex or synthetic condom during any sexual contact with females of reproductive potential.\n11. All patients should be encouraged to be fully vaccinated prior to initiation of therapy including being up-to-date on vaccines against pneumococcus, yearly influenza, Coronavirus disease (COVID) booster(s), and any age appropriate vaccine.

Has received treatment with cytotoxic (alkylators) within 3 weeks, biologic (IMiDs/PIs) within 2 weeks, targeted therapies (monoclonal antibodies) within 4 weeks, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell (CAR-T)or autologous stem cell transplant therapy within 3 months or any novel therapy within 5- 1/2 lives of therapy.\n4.

Has any active or uncontrolled infection including any viral, bacterial or fungal infection; and/or HIV, active hepatitis (Hep) C and active Hep B (hepatitis B (HB) surface antigen (HBsAg) (+), HB core antigen (HBcAb) (+) or (+) Hep B deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) by polymerase chain reaction (pcr), Hep C ribonucleic acid (RNA) (+) by pcr. Patients who have received Intravenous immunoglobulin therapy (IVIG) replacement therapy may have (+) HBcAb results from the IVIG therapy. These patients can enroll if Hep B DNA by pcr test is negative. These patients need to be on antiviral therapy and be monitored for hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA throughout study therapy per local guidelines and as clinically indicated.\n7. Has an additional active malignancy that may confound the assessment of the study endpoints. If the patient has a past cancer history (active malignancy within 2 years before study entry) with substantial potential for recurrence, this must be discussed with the sponsor/investigator before study entry. Patients with the following concomitant neoplastic diagnoses are eligible: nonmelanoma skin cancer and carcinoma in situ (including transitional cell carcinoma, cervical cancer, anal carcinoma, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and melanoma in situ), any cancer resected with curative intent, low-grade cancer not requiring therapy.\n8. Is pregnant or breast feeding.\n9. Has clinically significant cardiovascular disease including, albeit not limited to:\n\n   1.

Has uncontrolled, clinically significant organ dysfunction that in the opinion of the investigator would put the patient at significant risk for toxicity from study therapy.\n12. Has recent major surgery within 4 weeks or significant gastrointestinal (GI) disease that would interfere with GI absorption of oral medications.\n13. Has a condition, including autoimmune disease, requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (> 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days before study therapy administration. Inhaled or topical steroids and adrenal replacement doses <10 mg daily prednisone equivalents are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease.\n14.
