Participants must have recovered from all radiation-related toxicities, not require corticosteroids, and not have had radiation pneumonitis.\n* Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug. Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster (chicken pox), yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (eg, FluMist®) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.\n* Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy (in dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug.\n* Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or has required active treatment within the past X 3 years prior to screening. Note: Participants with basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or cervical carcinoma in situ are not excluded. Patients with prior ductal/lobular carcinoma in situ are not excluded if they were treated exclusively with mastectomy > 3 years prior to diagnosis of current breast cancer.\n* Has severe hypersensitivity (≥Grade 3) to pembrolizumab or olaparib and/or any of its excipients.\n* Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment.\n* Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment.\n* Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or has current pneumonitis\n* Severe infections within 4 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment, including but not limited to hospitalization for complications of infection, bacteremia, or severe pneumonia.\n* Treatment with therapeutic oral or IV antibiotics within 2 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment.\n\n  a.
