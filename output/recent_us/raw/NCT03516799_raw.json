Additional tumor histologies, including MSI-H tumors, may be allowed with approval from the medical monitor.\n* Measurable disease per RECIST v1.1.\n\nParts 1B and 2B:\n\n• Histologic confirmation of the cohort-specific tumor types specified below: Cohort 1 - Advanced or metastatic melanoma Cohort 2 - Advanced or metastatic NSCLC Cohort 3 - Recurrent or metastatic SCCHN Cohort 4 - Advanced or metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma\n\n* Cohorts 1-3 must have received 1 prior PD-1/L1 treatment and have experienced PD during or after that treatment and have progressed on other SOC therapy(ies); Cohort 4 must be PD-1/L1 treatment naïve but have progressed on SOC therapy(ies).\n* Measurable disease per RECIST v1.1.\n* Must be willing to submit to a fresh baseline tumor biopsy and an on-treatment biopsy between Cycle 2 Day 1 and Cycle 3 Day 1.\n* Care should be taken to biopsy the same lesion for the baseline and on-treatment samples. If a participant has a solitary target lesion, this should not be biopsied.\n\nPart 1C:\n\n* Participants with relapsed/refractory AML following standard therapy; acute promyelocytic leukemia (M3) and therapy-related AML are excluded.\n* FLT3-ITD and IDH1/2 wild-type or mutated are eligible; appropriate targeted therapy for participants with actionable mutations must have been received.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Laboratory values not within the protocol-defined range.\n* History of retinal disease as defined in the protocol.\n* Clinically significant cardiac disease as per protocol-defined criteria.\n* History or presence of an ECG that, in the investigator's opinion, is clinically meaningful as per protocol-defined criteria.\n* Untreated brain or central nervous system (CNS) metastases or brain or CNS metastases that have progressed as per protocol-defined criteria.\n* Active or inactive autoimmune disease or syndrome that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years or receiving systemic therapy for an autoimmune or inflammatory disease.\n* Prior Grade 3 or higher immune-related AEs or any ocular toxicity on prior immunotherapy as per protocol-defined criteria.\n* Receipt of any vitamin K antagonists, systemic corticosteroids, live vaccines, or treatment with any anticancer medications or investigational drugs within the protocol-defined intervals.\n* Has not recovered to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline from toxic effects of prior therapy and/or complications from prior surgical intervention before starting study treatment.\n* Active infection requiring systemic therapy.\n* Evidence of hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus infection or risk of reactivation.\n* Known history of HIV (HIV 1/2 antibodies).",
