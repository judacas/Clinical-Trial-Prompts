Patients emergently needing surgical debulking due to symptoms of their disease are not eligible.\n* Recovered from toxicities of prior therapy to grade 0 or 1\n* ECOG performance status ≤ 2.\n* Life expectancy of at least 3 months.\n* Acceptable liver function:\n* Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times upper limit of normal\n* AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) ≤ 3.0 times upper limit of normal (ULN);\n* Adequate renal function: calculated creatinine clearance ≥30mL/minute according to the Cockcroft and Gault formula\n* Acceptable hematologic status (without hematologic support)\n* ANC ≥1500 cells/uL\n* Platelet count ≥100,000/uL\n* Hemoglobin ≥9.0 g/dL\n* All women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test and male and female subjects must agree to use effective means of contraception (surgical sterilization or the use or barrier contraception with either a condom or diaphragm in conjunction with spermicidal gel or an IUD) with their partner from entry into the study through 6 months after the last dose.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* The subject is receiving warfarin (or other coumarin derivatives) and is unable to switch to low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) before the first dose of study drug.\n* The subject has evidence of acute intracranial or intratumoral hemorrhage either by MRI or computerized tomography (CT) scan. Subjects with resolving hemorrhage changes, punctate hemorrhage, or hemosiderin are eligible.\n* The subject is unable to undergo MRI scan (eg, has pacemaker).\n* The subject has received enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic agents within 14 days of study drug (eg, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone).\n* Patients whose only lesion undergoing resection has received stereotactic radiation within the past 3 months\n* The subject has received any of the following prior anticancer therapy:\n\n  * Biologic agents (antibodies, immune modulators, vaccines, cytokines) within 21 days prior to first dose of study drug\n  * Prior treatment with Sacituzumab Govitecan\n* Patients receiving UGT1A1 (Uridine diphosphate glucuronosyl transferase 1A1) inhibitors or inducers.\n* History of significant cardiovascular disease, defined as:\n\n  * Congestive heart failure greater than New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II according to the NYHA Functional Classification.\n  * Unstable angina or myocardial infarction within 6 months before enrollment.\n  * Serious cardiac arrhythmia.\n* Clinically significant ECG abnormality, including:\n\n  * Marked Baseline prolonged QT/QTc interval (ie, a repeated demonstration of a QTc interval >500 ms) demonstrated on ECG at Screening.\n  * History of risk factors for torsade de pointes (eg, heart failure, hypokalemia, family history of long QT Syndrome).\n* Any medical or other condition which, in the opinion of the Investigator, causes the subject to be medically unfit to receive Sacituzumab Govitecan, or unsuitable for any other reason.",
