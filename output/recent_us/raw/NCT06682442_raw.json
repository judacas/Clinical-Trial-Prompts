Participants <3 years of age, considered not suitable for radiotherapy may be eligible.\n* Minimum of 4 weeks between completion of radiation and Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1).\n* Maximum of 8 weeks between completion of radiation and C1D1. Exceptional circumstances can be discussed with the medical monitor.\n* Acute effects of prior therapies must be Grade ≤1 unless deemed clinically insignificant by the investigator.\n* Adequate hematologic and organ function ≤7 days prior to C1D1\n* Life expectancy of ≥8 weeks and deemed likely to complete at least 1 cycle of treatment.\n* A performance score of ≥60 using:\n\n  1. Lansky scale for participants <16 years\n  2. Karnofsky scale for participants ≥16 years\n* Able to swallow and/or have a gastric/nasogastric tube.\n* Any current systemic steroid use dose must be stable or decreasing at least 7 days prior to C1D1.\n* Able and willing to adhere to study procedures, including frequent blood draws and MRI.\n* At least 28 days since any major surgery, laparoscopic procedure, or a significant traumatic injury.\n* Has a body surface area (BSA) of ≥0.2 m2.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 0 Years\nMust have maximum age of 20 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "Participants are excluded if any of the following apply:\n\n* Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG) or diffuse midline glioma located in the pons.\n* Recurrent or refractory HGG including any recurrence/progression during/after radiotherapy.\n* Secondary HGG, defined as a previously treated low-grade glioma that now meets high- grade criteria, or that resulted from a previously treated malignancy.\n* Have known pathogenic somatic mutations appropriate for an anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), B-rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma (BRAF), or neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK ) inhibitor, in regions where these therapies are available and deemed appropriate by the investigator.\n* Prior HGG treatment (including bevacizumab), except for surgery and radiotherapy (with or without concomitant temozolomide).\n* Current enrollment in another trial deemed incompatible with this study.\n* Treatment with an investigational product within the last 30 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer).\n* Prior malignancy within the previous 3 years that, per the investigator and the medical monitor, may affect interpretation of study results.\n* A preexisting medical condition(s) that, per the investigator, would preclude study participation.\n* Any serious, active, systemic infection requiring IV antibiotic, antifungal, or antiviral therapy, including acute hepatitis B or C, or Human Immunodeficiency Virus at C1D1.\n* Intolerability or hypersensitivity such as urticaria, anaphylaxis, toxic necrolysis, and/or Stevens-Johnson syndrome to temozolomide, and/or abemaciclib, their excipients, or dacarbazine.\n* Received a live virus vaccine within 28 days of C1D1.\n* Pregnant, breastfeeding, or intend to become pregnant during the study.",
