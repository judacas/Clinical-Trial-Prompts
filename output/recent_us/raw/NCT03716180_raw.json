NOTE: Participants who completed treatment for in-situ carcinomas (e.g., breast, cervix, bladder), or basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin are eligible if no ongoing treatment is needed per Standard of Care.\n* Arterial or venous thromboembolism within 6 months prior to apheresis.\n* History of cerebrovascular accident or stroke (transient ischemic attack, hemorrhagic or ischemic) within 6 months prior to apheresis.\n* Functional or objective cardiac dysfunction: New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Capacity III or IV or Objective Assessment C or D.\n* Fridericia's corrected QT interval (QTcF) >= 480 msec or evidence of third-degree AV block on screening electrocardiogram (ECG).\n* Ejection fraction by screening echocardiogram < 50 percent.\n* Participants requiring therapeutic anticoagulation regimen(s) (e.g., warfarin, rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, low molecular weight heparin [e.g., enoxaparin, dalteparin, tinzaparin], heparin, fondaparinux).\n* History of gastrointestinal or non-gastrointestinal fistula >= Grade 3 (CTCAE v.5.0).\n* Radiographic evidence of major blood vessel invasion/infiltration.\n* History of hemoptysis or tumor bleeding within 1 month prior to apheresis.\n* Current gastrointestinal malabsorption, gastrointestinal anastomosis, or any other condition that might affect the absorption of lenvatinib.\n* Any form of primary immunodeficiency.\n* Participants with active autoimmune disease or a history of autoimmune disease, which require immune suppressive treatment such as systemic corticosteroids or other systemic immune suppressants (e.g., methotrexate, cyclosporine, and biologics). NOTE: Participants with vitiligo, endocrine deficiencies on replacement dose are eligible.\n* Systemic corticosteroid therapy of higher than a physiologic dose (the equivalent of prednisone 10 mg/day) within 14 days prior to apheresis.
