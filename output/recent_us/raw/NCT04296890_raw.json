Have hypersensitivity to nivolumab, relatlimab or any of their excipients.\n6.

Have had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy within 3 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from clinically significant adverse events due to a previously administered agent.\n\n   * Note: Subjects with ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy are an exception to this criterion and may qualify for the study.\n   * Note: If subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting therapy.\n   * Note: Patients will be allowed necessary and palliative radiation therapy to limited fields during the trial, as long as it does not encompass a target lesion.\n8. Have a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment. Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy, in situ cervical cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), incidentally discovered asymptomatic thyroid cancer, Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) recurrence of prostate cancer stable on hormonal therapy with no otherwise detectable disease, and a previous diagnosis of malignancy that has shown no evidence of disease progression for 5 years or longer.\n9. Have known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis as well as a history of previous or current significant brain hemorrhage. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least four weeks prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using steroids to treat edema for at least 7 days prior to trial treatment. This exception does not include carcinomatous meningitis, which will be excluded regardless of clinical stability.\n10. Have active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g. thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment.\n11.

Are patients with impaired decision-making capacity\n22. Are prisoners or participants who are involuntarily incarcerated.
