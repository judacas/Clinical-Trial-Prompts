Female participants: contraceptive use should be consistent with local regulations regarding the methods of contraception for those participating in clinical studies.\n\n   A female participant is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant or breastfeeding, and at least one of the following conditions applies:\n   * Is not a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) OR\n   * Is a WOCBP and using a contraceptive method that is highly effective (with a failure rate of <1% per year), preferably with low user dependency (as described in Appendix 3), during the intervention period and for at least 4 months after the last dose of study intervention and agrees not to donate eggs (ova, oocytes) for the purpose of reproduction during this period. The investigator should evaluate the effectiveness of the contraceptive method in relationship to the first dose of study intervention.\n\n   A WOCBP must have a negative highly sensitive serum pregnancy test (as required by local regulations) within 72 hours before the first dose of study intervention.\n\n   The investigator is responsible for review of medical history, menstrual history, and recent sexual activity to decrease the risk for inclusion of a woman with a nearly undetected pregnancy.\n\n   Nonchildbearing potential is defined as follows (by other than medical reasons):\n   * ≥45 years of age and has not had menses for >1 year\n   * Patients who have been amenorrhoeic for <2 years without history of a hysterectomy and oophorectomy must have a follicle stimulating hormone value in the postmenopausal range upon screening evaluation\n   * Post-hysterectomy, post-bilateral oophorectomy, or post-tubal ligation. Documented hysterectomy or oophorectomy must be confirmed with medical records of the actual procedure or confirmed by an ultrasound. Tubal ligation must be confirmed with medical records of the actual procedure.\n7. Male participants: contraceptive use should be consistent with local regulations regarding the methods of contraception for those participating in clinical studies.\n\n   Male participants are eligible to participate if they agree to the following during the intervention period and for 6 months after the last dose of study treatment to allow for clearance of any altered sperm:\n\n   • Refrain from donating sperm\n\n   PLUS either:\n\n   • Be abstinent from heterosexual intercourse as their preferred and usual lifestyle (abstinent on a long term and persistent basis) and agree to remain abstinent.\n\n   OR\n\n   • Must agree to use contraception/barrier as detailed below: Agree to use a male condom, even if they have undergone a successful vasectomy, and female partner to use an additional highly effective contraceptive method with a failure rate of <1% per year as when having sexual intercourse with a woman of childbearing potential (including pregnant females)\n8.

Participant must not have received prior treatment with a monoclonal antibody within 30 days of receiving the first dose of study drugs\n9. Participant must not have had major surgery ≤ 4 weeks prior to initiating study treatment\n10. Participant must not have any evidence of active mucosal or internal bleeding\n11. Participant must not have evidence of cardiovascular risk including any of the following:\n\n    * Evidence of current clinically significant uncontrolled arrhythmias, including clinically significant ECG abnormalities such as 2nd degree (Mobitz Type II) or 3rd degree atrioventricular (AV) block.\n    * History of myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndromes (including unstable angina), coronary angioplasty, or stenting or bypass grafting within three (3) months of Screening.\n    * Class III or IV heart failure as defined by the New York Heart Association functional classification system [NYHA, 1994]\n    * Uncontrolled hypertension\n12.
