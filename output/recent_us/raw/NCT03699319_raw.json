    "inclusion_criteria": "General Inclusion Criteria\n\n* Male/female participants who are at least 18 years of age on the day of signing informed consent with advanced/metastatic cutaneous melanoma, NSCLC or MSS mCRC who meet the following criteria will be enrolled in this study.\n* Male participants:\n\n  o A male participant must agree to use a contraception during the treatment period and for at least 120 days after the last dose of study treatment and refrain from donating sperm during this period.\n* Female participants:\n\n  * A female participant is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant, not breastfeeding, and at least one of the following conditions applies:\n  * Not a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP);OR\n  * A WOCBP who agrees to follow the contraceptive guidance during the treatment period and for at least 120 days after the last dose of study treatment.\n\nCohort 1 (MSS mCRC)\n\n* MSS is defined as 0-1 allelic shifts among 3-5 tumor microsatellite loci using a PCR-based assay or immunohistochemistry.\n* Must have received prior therapy with a fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan.\n* Prior treatment with an anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 or anti-CTLA-4 antibody is not allowed.\n* Prior treatment with BRAF/MEK inhibitor therapy (if BRAF mutated) and/or EGFR targeted antibody (if KRAS WT) are allowed.\n* No more than 2 prior lines of therapy for metastatic disease.\n* Adjuvant therapy will count as 1 prior line of therapy if received within the prior 6 months; but if not does not count towards prior line of therapy.\n* PIV (pan-immune-inflammation) cutoff of 1200 obtained on labs obtained during Screening.\n\nCohort 2 (PD-1 R/R melanoma)\n\n* PD-1 refractory disease as defined as progression on treatment with anti-PD-(L)1 inhibitor administered either as monotherapy or in combination with other checkpoint inhibitors or other therapies. PD-1 treatment progression is defined by meeting all of the following criteria:\n\n  * Receipt of at least 2 doses of an approved or investigational anti-PD-(L)1 inhibitor.\n  * Demonstrated PD after anti-PD-(L)1 inhibitor as defined by RECIST v1.1. The initial evidence of PD is to be confirmed by a second assessment no less than 4 weeks from the date of the first documented PD, in the absence of rapid clinical progression (as defined by the criteria in the sub-point below).\n  * Progressive disease that has been documented within 12 weeks from the last dose of anti-PD-(L)1 inhibitor.\n* Progressive disease is determined according to iRECIST.\n* This determination is made by the investigator. Once PD is confirmed, the initial date of PD documentation will be considered the date of disease progression.\n* Subjects who progressed on/within 3 months of adjuvant therapy with anti-PD-(L)1 inhibitor will be allowed; an adjuvant therapy will count as 1 prior line of therapy if received within the prior 6 months.\n* Prior treatment with an anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) antibody is allowed but not required.\n* Prior treatment with BRAF/MEK inhibitor therapy (if BRAF mutated) is allowed but not required.\n* No more than 5 prior lines of therapy.\n\nCohort 3 (PD-1 R/R NSCLC)\n\n* PD-1 refractory disease as defined as progression on treatment with anti-PD-(L)1 inhibitor administered either as monotherapy or in combination with other checkpoint inhibitors or other therapies. PD-1 treatment progression is defined by meeting all of the following criteria:\n\n  * Has received at least 2 doses of an approved or investigational anti-PD-(L)1 inhibitor.\n  * Has demonstrated PD after anti-PD-(L)1 inhibitor as defined by RECIST v1.1. The initial evidence of PD is to be confirmed by a second assessment no less than 4 weeks from the date of the first documented PD, in the absence of rapid clinical progression (as defined by the criteria in the sub-point below).\n  * Progressive disease has been documented within 12 weeks from the last dose of anti-PD-(L)1 inhibitor.\n* Progressive disease is determined according to iRECIST.\n* This determination is made by the investigator. Once PD is confirmed, the initial date of PD documentation will be considered the date of disease progression.\n* Subjects who progressed on/within 3 months of adjuvant therapy with anti-PD-(L)1 inhibitor will be allowed; an adjuvant therapy will count as 1 prior line of therapy if received within the prior 6 months.\n* Prior treatment with an anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) antibody is allowed but not required.\n* Prior treatment with BRAF/MEK inhibitor therapy (if BRAF mutated) must have received and progressed or have demonstrable intolerance to approved targeted therapy.\n* Patients with NSCLC with known oncogenic driver (including but not limited to EGFR, ALK, ROS, MET alterations) must have received and progressed past driver-specific therapy.\n* No more than 5 prior lines of therapy.\n\nOther Criteria\n\n* The participant (or legally acceptable representative if applicable) provides written informed consent for the trial.\n* Have measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1. Lesions situated in a previously irradiated area are considered measurable if progression has been demonstrated in such lesions.\n* Have provided newly obtained core or excisional biopsy of a tumor lesion not previously irradiated to undergo tumor biopsy (core, punch, incisional or excisional).\n\n  o Biopsy must meet minimal sampling criteria.\n* Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1. Evaluation of ECOG is to be performed within 28 days prior to the date of enrollment.\n* Adequate organ function. Screening labs obtained within 4 weeks of Cycle 1 day 1\n* Proteinuria exceeding 1gram in a 24 hour period.\n* A pan-immune-inflammation (PIV) cutoff of 1200 (obtained on labs during Screening)\n* Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required.\n* Female subjects of childbearing potential should be willing to use 2 methods of birth control or be surgically sterile or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course of the study through 120 days after the last dose of study medication. Subjects of childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not been free from menses for > 1 year.\n* Male subjects should agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting with the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy.\n* Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and preferred contraception for the subject.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
