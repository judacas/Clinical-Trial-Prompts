Positive test for hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg). If the patient is negative for HBsAg) but has positive hepatitis B core antibody, then hepatitis B surface antibody [Anti-HBs] testing is necessary (Hepatitis B core antibody testing is not required for screening but if this is done and is positive, then anti-HBs testing is necessary). Undetectable anti-HBs in this setting would suggest unclear and possible infecition and needs exclusion. Patients receiving antiviral therapy for Hepatitis B or C are not eligible.\n19.

[*] Subject or subject's legally acceptable representative has provided signed and dated written informed consent prior to initiation of any study specific activities/procedures in accordance with ICH-GCP guidelines and the local legislation.\n2. [*]Age > 18 years old.\n3. [*]Histologically or cytologically confirmed previously untreated non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. If a diagnostic biopsy is available, a pre-treatment biopsy is not required. Patients with a suspected lung cancer are eligible, but pathology must be confirmed prior to initiating treatment on study. Pure squamous cell carcinomas are not eligible but mixed histologies (for example adenosquamous carcinoma) are eligible. Sarcomatoid carcinomas are not eligible.\n\n   Neuroendocrine carcinomas are not eligible. Carcinomas with neuroendocrine differentiation are eligible. Patients with mixed small-cell lung cancer and NSCLC are not eligible.\n4. Identification of a KRAS p.G12C mutation in tumor tissue or plasma by an approved diagnostic device for detection of KRAS p.G12C in NSCLC or through any nucleic acid-based diagnostic testing method [including droplet-digital PCR, real-time PCR based methods such as the Idylla KRAS Mutation Assay (Biocartis), tissue and circulating tumor DNA -based next generation sequencing, Sanger-sequencing etc] performed in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified or equivalently accredited laboratory. Patients meeting [*] highlighted criteria will be offered study-provided droplet digital PCR or alternative PCR-based method such as the Idylla KRAS Mutation Assay (Biocartis) for detection of KRAS p.G12C using tumor tissue (1st choice if adequate tissue is available) or plasma (if tumor tissue is not available or cannot be accessed within 5 working days). Turnaround time for reporting of the presence or absence of a KRAS p.G12C mutation will be ≤ 5 working daysfor plasma-based testing and ≤7 working days from the date of confirmation of tissue availability for tissue-based testing. If analysis of tumor tissue fails due to technical reasons, the same patient can undergo analysis of circulating tumor DNA using droplet-digital PCR or alternative PCR-based method such as the Idylla KRAS Mutation Assay (Biocartis). If plasma-based analysis failes to detect a KRAS p.G12C mutation and tumor tissue becomes available, the same patient can undergo analysis of tumor tissue using droplet digital PCR or alternative PCR-based method such as the Idylla KRAS Mutation Assay (Biocartis).\n5. Patients with disease stage IIA to select stage IIIB (T3-4N2) (according to version 8 of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer Staging Manual in Thoracic Oncology [IASLC Staging Manual in Thoracic Oncology 2016]). Patients with multistation N2 disease are eligible provided that complete surgical resection is considered feasible by multidisciplinary evaluation which must include a thoracic surgeon that performs lung cancer surgery as a prominent part of his/her practice Invasive mediastinal staging with endosonography (EBUS or EUS) with fine-needle aspiration (FNA) and/or mediastinoscopy should be completed within 42 days from the start of treatment in the following cases:\n\n   * In case of mediastinal lymph nodes that are enlarged by CT criteria and/or PET-positive mediastinal lymph nodes.\n   * In case of tumors > 3 cm in maximum diameter\n   * In case of centrally located tumors\n   * For tumors with N1 nodes (cN1) Invasive mediastinal staging should include evaluation of contralateral stations 2 and/or 4 to exclude N3 disease as well as of subcarinal (station 7) lymph nodes. When there are no enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes by CT criteria and there is no uptake on PET/CT (cN0) direct surgical resection with lymph node dissection is indicated for tumors ≤ 3cm that are located in the outer third of the lung.\n6. [*] Absence of unequivocal evidence of stage IV disease based on contrast-enhanced CT chest, abdomen, pelvis or PET/CT and brain MRI with IV contrast (or contrast-enhanced CT of the head) performed within 60 days is sufficient for study registration but must be confirmed with whole-body PET/CT as well as contrast-enhanced CT chest and abdomen (or contrast-enhanced CT chest including the whole liver and both adrenal glands) and brain MRI with IV contrast (or contrast-enhanced CT of the head) within 28 days prior to the start of treatment. Patients with lesions that are considered equivocal for metastatic disease in the opinion of the local principal investigator are elibile to register and undergo molecular testing if they meet all other [*] marked criteria but must meet the full trial eligibility criteria prior to study enrollment. In patients with severe allergy to iodinated contrast absence of stage IV disease on PET/CT and brain MRI with IV contrast performed within 28 days prior to enrollment suffices to satisfy this eligibility criterion.\n7.
