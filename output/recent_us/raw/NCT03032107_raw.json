    "official_title": "A Multicenter Phase 1 Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and/or Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of the Combination of Rogaratinib and Copanlisib in Patients With FGFR-positive, Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* High FGFR mRNA expression levels (RNAscope score of ≥3; measurement is part of this protocol) in archival or fresh tumor biopsy specimen.\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) of 0 or 1.\n* At least 1 measurable lesion according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) in contrast enhanced (unless contraindicated) CT or MRI.\n* Adequate bone marrow, liver and renal function.\n* Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m*2 according to the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula.\n* Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) equal to or above the lower limit of normal (LLN) at the institution.\n* Life expectancy of at least 3 months.\n* For the dose escalation part: Patients with histologically confirmed, locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors who are not candidates for or refuse standard therapy or whose disease progressed and for which standard anti-cancer treatment is no longer effective, excluding primary brain or spinal tumors. Patients who have been advised with all standard treatment options and still refuse them must be documented and can be allowed to enter the trial.\n* For the dose expansion part: Patients with histologically confirmed, locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (transitional cell carcinoma) including urinary bladder, renal pelvis, ureters, urethra who are not candidates for or refuse standard therapy or whose disease progressed and for which standard anticancer treatment is no longer effective. Patients who have been advised with all standard treatment options and still refuse them must be documented and can be allowed to enter the trial.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Previous or concurrent cancer that is distinct from tumor for which the patient is enrolled in the study, except\n\n  * curatively treated cervical carcinoma in situ\n  * treated basal-cell carcinoma\n  * localized prostate cancer treated with curative intent and known absence of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) relapse or incidental prostate cancer (T1/T2a, Gleason score ≤ 6, and PSA ≤ 10 ng/mL undergoing active surveillance and treatment-naïve)\n  * any cancer curatively treated > 3 years before planned start of study treatment.\n* Ongoing or previous anti-cancer treatment within 4 weeks of study treatment start (or 6 weeks for mitomycin C, nitrosoureas and monoclonal antibodies); with exceptions.\n* Prior toxicity to anti-FGFR-directed or anti-PI3K-directed therapies leading to treatment discontinuation (previous exposure is allowed in other circumstances). If prior toxicity to anti-FGFR-directed or anti-PI3K-directed therapies leading to treatment discontinuation is different from the known safety profile of rogaratinib or copanlisib, enrollment is allowed.\n* Symptomatic brain or meningeal metastatic tumors unless the patient is >6 months from definitive therapy, has no evidence of tumor growth on an imaging study and is clinically stable with respect to the tumor at the start of study treatment. Also the patient must not be undergoing acute steroid therapy or taper (chronic steroid therapy is acceptable provided that the dose is stable for one month prior to and following screening radiographic studies).\n* History or current condition of an uncontrolled cardiovascular disease including congestive heart failure NYHA > Class 2, unstable angina (symptoms of angina at rest) or new-onset angina (within last 3 months) or myocardial infarction within past 6 months and cardiac arrhythmias requiring anti-arrhythmic therapy (beta-blockers or digoxin are permitted).\n* Active hepatitis B (HBV) or C (HCV) infection.\n* Active clinically serious infections (≥ CTCAE v4.03 Grade 2).",
