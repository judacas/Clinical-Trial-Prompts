    "inclusion_criteria": "Depressed participants will be required to be in good general health (as evaluated during Visit 1, including EKG) and to be 18-55 years of age. Depressed participants will be required to have symptoms of depression (i.e. a PHQ-9 score ≥10) and be unmedicated for at least 3 weeks (8 weeks for fluoxetine) or treated with only one anti-depressant medication. Half the depressed participants (N=50) will be required to have a high-sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (CRP) score of ≥3 mg/L, and half the participants will be required to have a CRP score of ≤1 mg/L.\n\nGeneral\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 55 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Pregnancy\n* Previous history of fainting during blood draws.\n\nMedical Conditions:\n\n* A history of a head injury with loss of consciousness.\n* Presence of co-morbid medical conditions not limited to but including cardiovascular (e.g., history of acute coronary event, stroke) and neurological diseases (e.g., Parkinson's disease), as well as pain disorders.\n* Presence of co-morbid inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis or other autoimmune disorders.\n* Presence of an uncontrolled medical condition that is deemed by the investigators to interfere with the proposed study procedures, or to put the study participant at undue risk.\n* Presence of chronic infection that may elevate pro-inflammatory cytokines.\n* Presence of an acute infectious illness or receipt of a vaccination in the two weeks prior to an experimental session.\n\nPsychiatric Disorders:\n\n* Current severe suicidal ideation or attempt within the past 12 months.\n* Psychosis\n* Bipolar disorder\n* Substance abuse or dependence within the previous 6 months\n* Age of onset of depression >40 years\n\nContraindications for MRI:\n\n* Severe claustrophobia\n* Bodily implants of unsafe paramagnetic materials such as pace-makers and aneurysm clips.\n\nMedications:\n\n* Current and/or past regular use of hormone-containing medications (excluding contraceptives)\n* Current use of non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs that is deemed by the investigators to potentially confound the results of the study\n* Current and/or past regular use of immune modifying drugs that target specific immune responses such as TNF antagonists\n* Current use of analgesics such as opioids or history of addiction to opioids or other analgesics\n* Current and/or past regular use of cardiovascular medications, including antihypertensive, antiarrhythmic, anti-anginal, and anticoagulant drugs (does not apply where medications are taken for different purpose e.g. anti-hypertensives for migraine).\n* Evidence of recreational drug use from urine test.\n* Lifetime use of methamphetamine\n\nHealth Factors:\n\n* BMI > 35 because of the effects of obesity on pro-inflammatory cytokine activity\n* Clinically significant abnormalities on screening laboratory tests\n* Abnormal EKG\n* In addition, participants who on arrival to the study, show any of the following symptoms will not be allowed to complete the study:\n\n  1. screening supine systolic blood pressure >140 mmHg or <100 mmHg\n  2. screening supine diastolic blood pressure >90 mmHg or <60 mmHg\n  3. 12-lead EKG demonstrating a PR interval > 0.2 msec, QTc >450 or QRS >120 msec If the QTc exceeds 450 msec, or QRS exceeds 120 msec, the EKG will be repeated 2 more times and the median value will be used\n  4. pulse less than 50 beats/minute or greater than 100 beats/minute\n  5. temperature greater than 99.5F.\n\n     Non-English speaking participants:\n* The majority of the assessments proposed for this study have not been translated from English, thus, non-English speaking volunteers will be excluded.",
