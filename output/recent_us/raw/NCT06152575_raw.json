    "inclusion_criteria": "5.3.1 Be willing and able to provide written informed consent/assent for the trial.\n\n5.3.2 Be ≥18 years of age on day of signing informed consent.\n\n5.3.3 Have a performance status of 0-3 on the ECOG Performance Scale.\n\n5.3.4 Have a life expectancy of 6 months or more as determined by treating physician.\n\n5.3.5 Not a candidate for or refuses chemotherapy; or failure of prior chemotherapy.\n\n5.3.6 PSA >2 ng/mL at baseline.\n\n5.3.7 Available archival tumor tissue for correlative studies. Submission of archival TRUS prostate biopsy tissue is required if available, in the form of representative formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor specimens in paraffin blocks (preferred) or at least 15 slides, with an associated pathology report. If archival prostate tissues are unavailable or cannot be obtained, a repeat TRUS prostate biopsy is not required for eligibility.\n\n5.3.8 Histologically-documented adenocarcinoma or mixed adenocarcinoma-neuroendocrine carcinoma of the prostate. All subjects must submit their primary tumor or metastatic biopsy pathology specimens and laboratory and imaging reports to Rampart Health where they will be centrally reviewed. Central Rampart Health pathologic review is not required for screening but rather for confirmation of diagnosis and histologic subtype of cancer. Local pathologic review is sufficient for eligibility determination.\n\n5.3.9 Measurable disease as defined by PCWG3 using iRECIST criteria and identified by radiographic imaging. In order to be eligible, the patient must have at least one metastatic bone and/or metastatic lymph node site(s) with cancer mass measuring 1 cm or more in diameter based on bone and/or soft tissue lesions as defined by any of the following:\n\n* Bone metastases defined by bone imaging. If the patient has technetium bone scan, and/or NaF PET performed, either study may be used for documenting metastases; both scans do not need to show the number of metastases required for study entry. For patients undergoing PSMA PET, only PSMA avid lesions that are consistent with metastasis will be counted as a site of metastasis.\n* Distant metastatic lymph node disease defined by imaging. A lymph node ≥1 cm in shortest dimension will be noted as involved with disease. Distant metastatic lymph nodes will be determined as any lymph nodes outside the confines of the true pelvis. For patients undergoing PSMA PET, only PSMA avid lesions that are consistent with metastasis will be counted as a site of metastasis.\n* Any other soft tissue lesion defined by imaging deemed by the physician to be consistent with distant metastatic disease. For patients undergoing PSMA PET, only PSMA avid lesions that have a CT or MRI correlate consistent with metastasis will be counted as a site of metastasis.\n\n5.3.10 The effects of the medications in this protocol on the developing human fetus are unknown. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must agree to use adequate contraception prior to the first dose of study therapy, for the duration of the study participation, and for 120 days after the last dose of study therapy.\n\n5.3.11 Their partners should be encouraged to use proper method of contraception.\n\n5.3.12 Acceptable initial laboratory values within 14 days of treatment initiation according to the following: ANC ≥ 1500/µl; Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL(prior transfusion permitted); Platelet count ≥ 100,000/µl; Creatinine ≤ 2.0 x the institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) OR creatinine clearance >30 ml/min; Potassium ≥ 3.5 mmol/L (within institutional normal range); Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN (unless documented Gilbert's disease); SGOT (AST) ≤ 2.5x ULN, or <5x ULN in patients with documented liver metastases; SGPT (ALT) ≤ 2.5x ULN or <5x ULN in patients with documented liver metastases; Albumin >2.5 mg/dL; Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) ≤1.5 X ULN unless subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants ≤1.5 X ULN unless subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants. Deviation from these values is allowed at the discretion of the treating investigator.\n\n5.3.13 No active major medical or psychological problems that could be complicated by study participation.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be MALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
