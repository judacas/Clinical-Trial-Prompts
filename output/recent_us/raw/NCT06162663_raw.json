    "official_title": "A Phase Ib/II Trial To Test The Safety And Efficacy Of Vaccination With HPV16-E711-19 Nanomer For The Treatment Of Incurable HPV 16-Related Oropharyngeal, Cervical And Anal Cancer In HLA-A*02 Positive Patients",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Each patient must be positive for HLA-A*02 and meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be enrolled in the study:\n* Histologically or cytologically proven HPVOC or cervical cancer or anal cancer, based on expression of HPV type16 in immunohistochemistry and/or HPV 16 DNA analysis by ISH of tumor tissue from the primary or metastatic lesions.\n* Incurable HPVOC, as defined by:\n\n  * Relapsed or progressive disease at the primary site and/or regional lymph nodes after initial treatment (e.g. Surgery, radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy) with no potentially curative option (i.e. surgery or radiation); OR\n  * Distant metastasis\n* Incurable cervical or anal cancer, as defined by:\n\n  * Relapsed or progressive disease at the primary site and/or regional lymph nodes after initial treatment (e.g. systemic chemotherapy) with no potentially curative option (i.e. surgery or chemoradiotherapy). Chemotherapy administered in conjunction with primary radiation as a radiosensitizer will not be counted as a systemic chemotherapy regimen; OR\n  * Distant metastasis refractory to initial treatment (at least one prior chemotherapeutic regimen which can include a single chemotherapeutic, a combination of chemotherapeutics, or biologic drugs such as bevacizumab).\n* Accessible tumors for sequential biopsies Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.0 (CTCAE v4.03) to grade 1 or better (except for < grade 2 neuropathy, alopecia, xerostomia, dysphagia, or mucositis);\n* Age ≥ 18 years;\n* Measurable disease, according to modified RECIST 1.1 and irRECIST (Appendix B & C);\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) ≤ 2 (Appendix A)\n* Adequate bone marrow, liver and renal function, defined by:\n\n  * Hemoglobin ≥ 10 g/dL;\n  * Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1000/μL;\n  * Absolute lymphocyte count ≥ 400/μL;\n  * Platelet count ≥ 100,000/μL;\n  * ALT and AST ≤ 2.5 X upper limit of normal (ULN);\n  * Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X ULN; and\n  * Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 X ULN;\n* Women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) must be willing to use acceptable means of birth control;\n* Men who could potentially father a child must also use birth control\n* Signed informed consent\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Radiotherapy for primary HPVOC within 8 weeks, or radiotherapy for any other reason within 3 weeks prior to the first dose of trial treatment;\n* Chemotherapy within 3 weeks prior to the first dose of trial treatment;Other cancer in the past 5 years, except for carcinoma in situ of the cervix or bladder, or non-melanomatous skin cancer;\n* Inaccessible tumor or lack of consent for sequential biopsies\n* Uncontrolled central nervous system (CNS) metastases (i.e. known CNS lesions that are radiographically unstable, symptomatic and/or requiring escalating doses of corticosteroids);\n* Active hepatitis, known HIV, or other condition that requires immunosuppressive therapy, including current use of high dose systemic corticosteroids;\n* Autoimmune disease, such as systemic lupus erythematosis or rheumatoid arthritis, that is active and requires current immunosuppressive therapy;\n* Active uncontrolled serious infection;\n* WOCBP who have a positive β-hCG test or are breastfeeding.\n* Acute or chronic skin disorders that would interfere with subcutaneous injection of the vaccine or subsequent assessment of potential skin reactions;\n* Allergies to any vaccine, that after discussion with Immunovaccine, are serious enough to warrant exclusion from this study",
