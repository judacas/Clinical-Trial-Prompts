    "official_title": "A Pilot Study of Darzalex Faspro (Daratumumab and Hyaluronidase-fihj) Before Standard Desensitization and Allogeneic Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation in Adult Patients at High-risk for Primary Graft Failure Secondary to Donor Specific Antibodies",
    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Participates must meet all other institutional criteria for the planned reduced intensity conditioning allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplant (RIC alloHSCT) as defined in Johns Hopkins BMT Policy; all potential non-cord blood donor sources are included: matched related, haploidentical, matched unrelated, mismatched unrelated.\n2. Participants must be ≥18 years of age.\n3. Participants must have adequate organ function for undergoing RIC allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplant, and for undergoing a clinical trial.\n\n   a. Hematologic. i. White blood cell (WBC). ANC ≥ 500/mm3 (growth factor support allowed). ii. Hemoglobin. No specific cut-off. (PRBC transfusion allowed). iii. Platelets. Platelets ≥ 10,000/mm3 (platelet transfusion allowed). b. Liver. Bilirubin ≤ 3.0 mg/dL (unless due to Gilbert's syndrome or hemolysis), and Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) and Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) < 5x Upper limit of normal (ULN) c. Renal. Serum creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dL. d. Cardiac. Left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 35%. e. Pulmonary. FEV1 ≥ 50%.\n4. Subjects are eligible if there are high levels of Donor Specific Antibody levels based on protocol specific scoring system regardless of prior attempts at standard desensitization.\n5. Participants must have a no other readily available suitable alternative donor.\n6. All potential Participants must be pre-approved by BMT faculty consensus.\n7. Participants must have adequate willingness to participate in a clinical trial.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Previous exposure to Daratumumab-SC or other anti-CD38 therapy\n\n   1. Exposure to Daratumumab-SC or other anti-CD38 therapies (unless a re-treatment study)\n   2. Exposure to an investigational drug (including investigational vaccine) or invasive investigational medical device for any indication within 4 weeks or 5 pharmacokinetic half-lives, whichever is longer.\n   3. Focal radiation therapy within 14 days prior to beginning of planned RIC allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplant regimen with the exception of palliative radiotherapy for symptomatic management but not on measurable extramedullary plasmacytoma\n2. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) < 50% of predicted normal. Note that FEV1 testing is required for participants suspected of having COPD and participants must be excluded if FEV1 is < 50% of predicted normal.\n3. Moderate or severe persistent asthma within the past 2 years, or uncontrolled asthma of any classification. Note that participants who currently have controlled intermittent asthma or controlled mild persistent asthma are allowed to participate.\n4. Known hypersensitivity or intolerance to boron or mannitol, sorbitol, corticosteroids, monoclonal antibodies or human proteins, or the excipients\n5. Diagnosis of multiple myeloma or Amyloid light-chain (AL) amyloidosis\n6. A planned myeloablative alloBMT or the planned use of bone marrow or cord blood as a stem cell source\n7. History of HIV infection at any time in past.\n8. Seropositive for hepatitis B (HBV) (defined by a positive test for hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] positive, or antibodies to hepatitis B surface and/or core antigens [antiHBs or antiHBc, respectively] with hepatitis B virus [HBV]- DNA quantitation positive). Patients who are positive for antiHBs and/or antiHBc must have a negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HBV-DNA quantitation result during screening. Patients with serologic findings suggestive of HBV vaccination (antiHBs positivity as the only serologic marker) AND a known history of prior HBV vaccination do not need to be tested for HBV DNA by PCR. Those who are PCR positive will be excluded.\n9. Seropositive for hepatitis C (except in the setting of a sustained virologic response (SVR), defined as aviremia at least 12 weeks after completion of antiviral therapy)\n10. Clinically significant cardiac disease, including:\n\n    1. Myocardial infarction within 6 months before RIC alloHSCT or unstable or uncontrolled disease/condition related to or affection cardiac function (e.g., unstable angina, congestive heart failure, New York Heart Association Class III-IV)\n    2. Uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia",
