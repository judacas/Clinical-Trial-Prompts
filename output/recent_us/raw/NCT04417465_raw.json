    "official_title": "Efficacy & Safety of LOBO™ Vascular Occlusion Device for Embolization of Pulmonary Arteriovenous Malformations (PAVM)",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* At least 1 PAVM with a feeding artery ≥2 mm in diameter and a feeding artery amenable to the use of LOBO™ device (i.e. feeding artery length of ≥1 cm). Given the length of embolic devices including LOBO™, the proximal vessel length to the PAVM sac must be of sufficient size for embolization to be feasible. If patients have at least 1 PAVM where the feeding artery length is ≥1 cm, they are eligible for enrollment.\n* Patients with multiple PAVMs meeting eligibility criteria may be enrolled with the intent of embolizing multiple different PAVMs with the LOBO™ device in the same embolization session or in separate sessions.\n* Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate >30 ml/min\n* Per standard of care (SOC), all pregnant women to be enrolled must be in their 2nd or 3rd trimesters\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 14 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Confounding bleeding disorders other than HHT\n* Life-threatening iodinated contrast allergy not amenable to prophylactic therapy with steroids\n* Underlying coagulopathy\n* Patients on anti-platelets or anti-coagulation medications",
    "miscellaneous_criteria": ""
