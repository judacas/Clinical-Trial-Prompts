    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Provision to sign and date the consent form.\n2. Stated willingness to comply with all study procedures and be available for the duration of the study.\n3. Be a male or female aged 18-100.\n4.

Patients with pacemakers, defibrillators, or other implanted electronic devices. Dental implants, fillings, or fiducial markers may be acceptable, and the decision for inclusion/exclusion will be on a case-by-case basis, by reviewing prior CT images of the study candidate. Patient's prior CT images will be reviewed by the PI or the site PI.\n2. Patients who do not have the ability to lie still for the duration of his/her CBCT imaging and treatment should be excluded. If image artifacts in prior scans are deemed excessive, the patient will be excluded from the study.\n3. Known pregnancy. (Per SOC, a pregnancy test will be performed prior to CBCT scan on Day 1. At this time, women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) will receive a pregnancy test to re-confirm eligibility).\n\n   * Women of child-bearing potential are described as:\n\n     1. Age 55 or younger who have not had a negative pregnancy test within 3 days. This excludes patients who have had tubal ligation or are already post-menopausal.",
