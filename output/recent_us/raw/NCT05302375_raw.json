    "inclusion_criteria": "* Patients with recurrent squamous cell carcinoma or a second primary arising in a previously irradiated field\n* Life expectancy of greater than 6 months\n* Patients cannot have distant metastases and have to be candidates for curative re-irradiation\n* Patients with salivary gland tumors are excluded (patients with nasopharynx or sinonasal cancers can participate)\n* Patients with unresectable disease are eligible\n* Patients who undergo surgical resection will be allowed regardless of human papilloma virus (HPV) status provided they have one of the following criteria:\n\n  * Positive margins on pathology\n  * Evidence of extracapsular spread on nodal pathology\n  * Gross residual disease on postoperative or simulation imaging\n  * N2/3 disease\n  * T3/4 disease\n  * Multifocal perineural invasion and/or lymphovascular space invasion\n* The majority of the anticipated target volume (> 50%) must have been previously treated to ≥ 40 Gy; prior radiation therapy (RT) must have been completed > 6 months prior to initiation of IMRT reirradiation; if previous RT records are unavailable, investigators can estimate the dose to previously treated tissues based on completion notes or other treatment history\n* An Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score 0-2\n* Granulocytes > 1500/mm³\n* Platelets > 100,000/mm³\n* Bilirubin < 1.5 mg/dl\n* Creatinine < 1.5 mg/dl\n* No other concurrent invasive malignancies treated for the past year (localized prostate cancer or early stage skin cancer are not exclusion criteria)\n* Patients with carotid artery involvement or encasement will be allowed provided they have no symptoms related to carotid involvement\n* No prior exposure to immunotherapy agents\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Any known factors that would pose a contraindication to receiving nivolumab\n* Recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) class III patients defined as those expected to begin reirradiation within 2 years of first course of radiation therapy AND are percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) dependent or have a tracheostomy (patients who have undergone total laryngectomy are not excluded)\n* Patients with metastases\n* Prior treatment with a programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor\n* Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to enrollment\n* Patients with primary salivary gland cancers are excluded\n* Patients who have had chemotherapy or biological therapy within 4 weeks of registration\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, autoimmune disease requiring systemic steroids, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements\n* Patients who are pregnant or breast-feeding\n* Patients with known active human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis (hep) B, or hep C infection\n* Subjects with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (> 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study drug administration; inhaled or topical steroids and adrenal replacement doses > 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease",
