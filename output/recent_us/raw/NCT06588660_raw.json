    "official_title": "A Phase 3, Multicenter, Open-Label, Randomized Study of Nemvaleukin Alfa in Combination With Pembrolizumab Versus Investigator's Choice Chemotherapy in Patients With Platinum-Resistant Epithelial Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer (ARTISTRY-7)",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Patient is female and ≥18 years of age.\n* Patient has histologically confirmed diagnosis of EOC (ie, high-grade serous, endometrioid of any grade, clear cell), fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer.\n* Patient has platinum-resistant/refractory disease, defined as disease progression within 180 days following the last administered dose of platinum therapy beyond first-line setting (resistant) or lack of response or disease progression while receiving the most recent platinum-based therapy (refractory). Patient must have progressed radiographically on or after their most recent line of anticancer therapy.\n* Patient must have received at least 1 prior line of systemic anticancer therapy in the platinum sensitive setting, and no more than 5 prior lines of systemic anticancer therapy in the platinum-resistant setting. Patient must have received at least 1 line of therapy containing bevacizumab.\n* Patient has at least one measurable lesion that qualifies as a target lesion based on RECISTv1.1.\n* Patient is willing to undergo a pre-treatment tumor biopsy or provide qualifying archival tumor tissue.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be FEMALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Patient has primary platinum-refractory disease or primary platinum resistance, defined as disease progression during first-line platinum-based therapy (refractory) or disease progression <3 months after completion of first-line platinum-based therapy (resistant).\n* Patient has histologically confirmed diagnosis of EOC with mucinous or carcinosarcoma subtype.\n* Patient has nonepithelial tumor (eg, germline or stromal cell tumor) or ovarian tumor with low malignant potential (ie, borderline or low-grade serous tumor).\n* Patient requires fluid drainage (eg, paracentesis, thoracentesis, pericardiocentesis) of ≥500 mL within 4 weeks of first dose of study drug.\n* Patient has received prior IL-2-based or IL-15-based cytokine therapy; patient has had exposure, including intralesional, to IL-12 or analogs thereof.\n* Patient has prior exposure to any anti-PD1/PD-L1 therapy.",
