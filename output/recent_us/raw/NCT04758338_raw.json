Use of any investigational anticancer therapy must not have been received within 28 days prior to the first dose of study drugs.\n6. Any chemotherapy, antibody drug conjugate or immunotherapy for cancer treatment in the prior 21 days, or small molecular inhibitor in the prior 7 days.\n\n   • Stereotactic, palliative radiation for symptomatic bone metastases is acceptable without a washout.\n\n   • Stereotactic brain radiation for asymptomatic brain metastases is acceptable with a 7-day washout.\n7. Prior therapy with any selective inhibitor of the DLL3 pathway.\n8. Prior history of severe or life-threatening events from any immune-mediated therapy.\n9. Receiving systemic corticosteroid therapy or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to enrollment.
