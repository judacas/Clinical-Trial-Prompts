Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately\n* Participant must understand the investigational nature of this study and sign an Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board approved written informed consent form prior to receiving any study related procedure\n* Candidate for continuation/resumption of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 blockade (in parallel to DC vaccine and CKM)\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Is currently being treated with systemic immunosuppressive agents, including steroids: Subjects will be ineligible until 3 weeks after removal from immunosuppressive treatments, except when they are administered as replacement therapy for endocrine dysfunction (and receive no more than 10 mg prednisone or equivalent: inhaled steroids are allowed)\n* Has had prior anti-cancer therapy within 2 weeks prior to study day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., no more than grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to a previously administered agent, except for neuropathy (no more than grade 2) or alopecia or vitiligo (any grade)\n* Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment\n* Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Treated brain metastases are allowed, if stable for more than 4 weeks (and receive no more than 10 mg prednisone or equivalent: inhaled steroids are allowed).\n* Has a history of cardiac event(s) (acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction, or ischemia (within 3 months of signing consent) or, subject has a New York Heart Association classification of III or IV\n* Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy\n* Has known active hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection\n* Has known immunosuppressive disease (e.g. human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS] or other immune depressing disease).
