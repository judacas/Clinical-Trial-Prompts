    "exclusion_criteria": "* Prior immunotherapy with PD-1 or PD-L1 or CTLA-4 targeting agents\n* Patients with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (> 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent) within 14 days or another immunosuppressive medication within 30 days of the first dose of study treatment.

Repeat brain imaging following surgical resection or stereotactic radiosurgery at least 4 weeks from treatment should document lack of progression\n* Concurrent non-colorectal second malignancy (present during screening) requiring treatment or history of a non-colorectal second primary metastatic malignancy within 2 years prior to the first dose of study treatment. Patients with history of prior early-stage basal/squamous cell skin cancer, low-risk prostate cancer eligible for active surveillance or noninvasive or in situ cancers who have undergone definitive treatment at any time are also eligible\n* Any evidence of current interstitial lung disease (ILD) or pneumonitis or a prior history of ILD or non-infectious pneumonitis requiring high-dose glucocorticoids\n* Psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the study\n* History or current evidence of any condition, co-morbidity, therapy, any active infections, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the patient's participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of the patient to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator\n* Known previous SARS-CoV-2 infection within 10 days for mild or asymptomatic infections or 20 days for severe/critical illness prior to cycle 1 day 1 (C1D1)\n* Uncontrolled infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

Serological testing for HBV at screening is not required\n* Known active hepatitis C virus (HCV) as determined by positive serology and confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Patients on or who have received antiretroviral therapy are eligible provided they are virus-free by PCR for at least 6 months prior to study entry. Serological testing for HCV at screening is not required\n* Dependence on total parenteral nutrition or intravenous hydration\n* Any other condition that would, in the investigator's judgment, contraindicate the patient's participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns with clinical study procedures\n* Prospective participants who, in the opinion of the investigator, may not be able to comply with all study procedures (including compliance issues related to feasibility/logistics)",
