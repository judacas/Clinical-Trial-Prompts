Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test at screening (within 72 hours of first dose of study medication) and prior to study drug administration. In part 1, WOCBP must agree to use highly effective contraceptive measures starting with the screening visit through 3 months after the last dose of study treatment. In Part 2, WOCBP must agree to use highly effective contraceptive measures starting with the screening visit through 5 months after the last dose of study treatment. Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the established and preferred contraception for the participant.\n10. In Part 1, male participants with a female partner(s) of childbearing potential must agree to use highly effective contraceptive measures throughout the study, starting with the screening visit through 3 months after the last dose of study treatment is received. In Part 2, male participants with a female partner(s) of childbearing potential must agree to use highly effective contraceptive measures throughout the study starting with the screening visit through 5 months after the last dose of study treatment is received. Males with pregnant partners must agree to use a condom; no additional method of contraception is required for the pregnant partner.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
