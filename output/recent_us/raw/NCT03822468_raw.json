    "exclusion_criteria": "* Currently transformed lymphoma, high-risk mantle cell lymphoma, or gastric MALT lymphoma.\n* Need for immediate treatment or cytoreduction.\n* No easily accessible site for direct percutaneous injection with low-risk for potential complications.\n* Autoimmune disease requiring treatment within the last 5 years including systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, Sjogren's syndrome, autoimmune thrombocytopenia, uveitis, or other if clinically significant\n* Major surgery within 4 weeks of enrollment, or a wound that has not fully healed\n* Vaccinated with live, attenuated vaccines within 4 weeks of enrollment\n* Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or active hepatitis C virus or active hepatitis B virus infection or any uncontrolled active systemic infection\n* Known central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma\n* Patients with a history of prior malignancy with the exception of non-melanoma skin cancer, stage 1 prostate cancer that does not require treatment, or other malignancy that has undergone potentially curative therapy with no evidence of disease for the last 2 years and that is deemed by the investigators to be at low risk for recurrence. In situ cancer of any type and noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features (NIFTP) is not an exclusion, though if surgery or other definitive intervention is planned, it should be completed prior to enrollment.\n* History of significant allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar composition to SD-101 or BMS-986178\n* Treatment with an immunosuppressive regimen of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medication (e.g., methotrexate, rapamycin) within 30 days of study treatment; Note: patients may take up to 5 mg of prednisone or equivalent daily; topical and inhaled corticosteroids in standard doses are allowed\n* Significant cardiovascular disease (i.e. New York Heart Association [NYHA] class 3 congestive heart failure; myocardial infarction within the past 6 months; unstable angina; coronary angioplasty with the past 6 months; uncontrolled atrial or ventricular cardiac arrhythmias)\n* Pregnant or breast feeding\n* Any other medical history, including laboratory results, deemed by the investigator likely to interfere with their participation in the study, or to interfere with the interpretation of the results",
