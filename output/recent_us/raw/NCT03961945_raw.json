    "official_title": "A Phase II Single Arm Trial Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of Anhydrous Enol-Oxaloacetate on Improving Cognitive Complaints in Breast Cancer Survivors",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Women with a diagnosis of early stage breast cancer (stage 0, I, II, IIIa) who are at least 12 months after surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, but may be on endocrine therapy or HER-2 targeted therapy, and not more than 5 years after their breast cancer diagnosis\n* No evidence of active/recurrent breast cancer or other serious chronic illness\n* Has significant cognitive complaints, defined as a score of < 12 on the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Adult version (v) 2.0 - Cognitive Function 4a\n* Is geographically accessible, and able to participate in a study of 8-10 weeks duration\n* Ability to complete evaluation surveys in English\n* The effects of oxaloacetate on the developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic dose are unknown. For this reason, women of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (barrier method of birth control; intrauterine device [IUD]; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Women of any age who have had their ovaries and/or uterus removed will not be at risk for pregnancy and will not require contraception. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her study physician immediately. Menopausal status will be established as follows: Women who are 55 years or older and who are not menstruating will be considered postmenopausal and not at risk for pregnancy. Women who are less than 55 years old who are menstruating will be considered premenopausal and will require contraception. Women who are less than 55 years with an intact uterus and ovaries who are not menstruating and have not had a menstrual period within the past 2 years will have an follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol measured. If the values are in postmenopausal range the woman will be considered postmenopausal and she will not be considered at risk for pregnancy\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be FEMALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 74 Years",
