Refractory myeloma is defined as disease that is nonresponsive while on therapy or progresses within 60 days of last therapy. Nonresponsive disease is defined as either failure to achieve at least minimal response or development of progressive disease (PD) while on any therapy.\n\n     2. Participant must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of ≤ 2 3. Participant must be ≥ 18 years of age 4.

Is a WOCBP and using a contraceptive method that is highly effective (with a failure rate of <1% per year), preferably with low user dependency (as described in Appendix 3), during the intervention period and for at least 4 months after the last dose of study intervention and agrees not to donate eggs (ova, oocytes) for the purpose of reproduction during this period. The investigator should evaluate the effectiveness of the contraceptive method in relationship to the first dose of study intervention.\n\nA WOCBP must have a negative highly sensitive serum/urine pregnancy test (as required by the protocol) within 72 hours before the first dose of study intervention. WOCBP will have pregnancy testing within 72 hours on day 1 of each cycle.\n\nThe investigator is responsible for review of medical history, menstrual history, and recent sexual activity.\n\nb. Nonchildbearing potential is defined as follows: i. Premenarchal ii. Premenopausal female with ONE of the following:\n\n1. Documented hysterectomy 2. Documented bilateral salpingectomy 3.

For individuals with permanent infertility due to an alternate medical cause other than the above, (e.g., mullerian agenesis, androgen insensitivity), investigator discretion should be applied to determining study entry.\n\na. Note: Documentation can come from the site personnel's: review of participant's medical records, medical examination, or medical history review iii. Postmenopausal female\n\n1. A postmenopausal state is define as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, confirmation with more than one FSH measurement is required.\n2. Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use of the non-estrogen hormonal highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrollment.\n\n6. Male participants:\n\nMale participants are eligible to participate if they agree to the following during the intervention period and for 6 months after the last dose of study treatment to allow for clearance of any altered sperm:\n\n1. Refrain from donating sperm PLUS, either\n2. Be abstinent from heterosexual intercourse as their preferred and usual lifestyle (abstinent on a long term and persistent basis) and agree to remain abstinent.\n\nOR c. Must agree to use contraception/barrier as detailed below: i. Agree to use a male condom, even if they have undergone a successful vasectomy, and female partner to use an additional highly effective contraceptive method with a failure rate of <1% per year as when having sexual intercourse with a woman of childbearing potential (including pregnant females).\n\n7. All prior treatment-related toxicities (defined by National Cancer Institute- Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE), version 5.0) must be ≤ Grade 1 at the time of enrollment except for alopecia or at a stable baseline for at least 6 weeks.\n\n8. Participant must be able to understand the study procedures and agree to participate in the study by providing written informed consent 9. Participant must agree to not wear contact lenses while on the study 10. Participant must agree to have a detailed eye exam by an eye care specialist prior to each treatment of Belantamab mafodotin and agree to use preservative-free lubricant eye drops at least 4 times every day while on treatment\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",

NOTE: Stable non-cirrhotic chronic liver disease (including Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones) or hepatobiliary involvement of malignancy is acceptable if otherwise meets entry criteria 3. Participant must not have presence of active renal condition (infection, requirement for dialysis or any other condition that could affect participant's safety).
