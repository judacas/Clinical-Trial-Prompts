    "inclusion_criteria": "* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0, 1, or 2\n* Histologically documented CD20+ FL (Grades 1-3a)\n* Requiring systemic therapy assessed by investigator based on tumor size and/or Groupe d'Etude des Lymphomes Folliculaires (GELF) criteria\n* Received at least one prior systemic lymphoma therapy, which included prior immunotherapy or chemoimmunotherapy\n* Availability of a representative tumor specimen and the corresponding pathology report at the time of relapse/persistence for confirmation of the diagnosis of FL. Pretreatment sample of at least 1 core-needle, excisional or incisional tumor biopsy is required. Cytological or fine-needle aspiration samples are not acceptable. Fresh pretreatment biopsy is preferred. Patients who are unable to undergo biopsy procedures may be eligible for study enrollment if an archival tumor tissue sample (preferably from the most recent relapse/persistence) as paraffin blocks or at least 15 unstained slides, or in accordance with local regulatory requirements, can be sent to the Sponsor.\n* Adequate hematologic function (unless due to underlying lymphoma, per the investigator)\n* Agreement to comply with all local requirements of the lenalidomide risk minimization plan, which includes the global pregnancy prevention program.\n* For women of childbearing potential: Agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use 2 adequate methods of contraception, including at least 1 method with a failure rate of < 1% per year, for at least 28 days prior to Day 1 of Cycle 1, during the treatment period (including periods of treatment interruption), and for at least 28 days after the last dose of lenalidomide, 3 months after the final dose of tocilizumab (if applicable), mosunetuzumab, and 12 months after final dose of rituximab. Women must refrain from donating eggs during this same period.\n* For men: Agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive measures and agreement to refrain from donating sperm, as defined: With female partners of childbearing potential or pregnant female partners, men must remain abstinent or use a condom during the treatment period and for at least 28 days after last dose of lenalidomide, 3 months after the final dose of tocilizumab (if applicable), mosunetuzumab and 12 months after the final dose of rituximab. Men must refrain from donating sperm during this same period.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
