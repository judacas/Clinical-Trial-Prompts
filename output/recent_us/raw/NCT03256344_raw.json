    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Must be 18 years of age or older.\n2. Must have pathologically documented locally advanced or metastatic malignancy harboring KRAS G12D mutations identified through deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequencing of tumor tissues or circulating deoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA) performed locally.\n3. Must have received prior standard therapy appropriate for their tumor type, or in the opinion of the investigator, would be unlikely to derive further clinically meaningful benefit from appropriate standard of care therapy.\n4. Must have measurable lesion(s) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) version 1.1 by Computed tomography (CT) scan with contrast (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), if the patient is allergic to contrast media).\n\n   * Measurable disease may be in the field of prior irradiation; however, at least 3 weeks must have elapsed between the completion of radiation therapy and the baseline scan documenting disease status.\n   * Bone disease is considered radiologically measurable only if there is at least a 50% lytic component.\n\n   NOTE: Bone disease consisting of only blastic lesion is not considered measurable.\n\n   NOTE: in Phase 1a, patients must have measurable or evaluable disease.\n5. Archival or fresh tumor tissue must be available for evaluating relevant biomarkers. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE)block preferred, or a minimum of 3 unstained FFPE slides of one archived block is required.\n\n   NOTE: cytology samples from fine needle aspirates or brushing biopsies are not sufficient.\n\n   NOTE: Phase 1a and 1b: Patients are additionally encouraged to undergo pre-treatment tumor biopsy.\n6. Must have adequate performance status, Appendix D.\n\n   o Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS) score of 0, or 1.\n7. Must be able to take oral medications and willing to record daily adherence to the investigational product.\n8. Must have adequate laboratory parameters at baseline:\n\n   * Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.2 x 109/L.\n   * Hemoglobin greater than or equal to (≥) 9 g/dL.\n   * Platelet count ≥ 75 x 109/L.\n   * Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) less than or equal to (≤) 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) (≤ 5 x ULN in presence of liver metastases).\n   * Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x institutional ULN [less than (<) 2.5 x ULN for patients with documented Gilbert's syndrome or < 3.0 x ULN for patients for whom the indirect bilirubin level suggests an extrahepatic source of elevation].\n   * Calculated creatinine clearance greater than (>) 60 mL/min. Actual body weight should be used for calculating creatinine clearance (e.g. using the Cockcroft-Gault formula).\n\n   For patients with a Body Mass Index (BMI) > 30 Kg/m2, lean body weight should be used instead.\n   * Acceptable coagulation parameters: Fibrinogen ≥ 1.5 g/dL, or partial thromboplastin time (PTT) ≤ 1.5 X institutional ULN, or international normalized ratio (INR) < 1.5 X institutional ULN or within target range if a patient is on prophylactic anti-coagulant therapy.\n   * Serum albumin ≥ 3.0 g/dL.\n9. Must have life expectancy of > 12 weeks according to the Investigator's clinical judgment.\n10. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at screening and additional pregnancy test prior to first dose.\n\n    NOTE: Positive pregnancy test may occur in approximately 10% of cancer patients, who are otherwise postmenopausal. This is due to Human Chorionic Gonadotrophin (HCG) secreted by some tumor types such as ovarian or colorectal cancer (CRC), even in postmenopausal women. A quantitative test should be performed in patients with a positive serum pregnancy test, otherwise thought to be postmenopausal.\n11. Males and females of childbearing potential must agree to use a highly effective method of contraception during treatment and for at least 6 months after the last dose of study treatment. These include, but not limited to:\n\n    o Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (i.e. intravaginal or transdermal).\n    * Progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (i.e. injectable or implantable).\n    * Intrauterine device.\n    * Bilateral tubal occlusion.\n    * Vasectomized partner.\n    * Sexual abstinence (defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatments) is intended. The true abstinence is when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. (Periodic abstinence [e.g. calendar, ovulation, symptom-thermal, post-ovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception).\n\n    NOTE: A patient is not considered in childbearing potential if any of the following criteria is met:\n    * has had a hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy.\n    * Age ≥ to 60 years and is amenorrhoeic.\n    * Age < 60 years and has been amenorrhoeic for ≥12 months (including no irregular menses or spotting) in the absence of any medication which induces a menopausal state and has ovarian failure as indicated by serum estradiol and follicle-stimulating hormone levels.\n\n    NOTE: Male patients will be advised to arrange for the freezing of sperm samples prior to the start of the study, and not to donate sperm until 6 months after discontinuation of study treatment.\n12. Must be able to understand and comply with the conditions of the protocol and must have read and understood the consent form and provided written informed consent.\n\n    Food Effect Assessment- Specific Inclusion Criteria\n13. Must be able to eat a standardized high-fat, high-caloric meal within 30 minutes.\n14. Must be able to fast for a minimum of 10 hours. Phase 1b and Phase 2 Specific inclusion criteria\n15. Patient must have received at least one but no more than two prior lines of systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy in locally advanced or metastatic setting.\n16.
