    "official_title": "A Pilot Study of 1-(2-[18f]Fluoroethyl)-L-Tryptophan PET/CT Imaging in Human Cancers",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Age â‰¥18 years.\n* Targeted lesion (tumor) is at least 1 cm in diameter as shown by clinical imaging.\n* Patient is able to lie in the PET/CT scanner for at least 70 minutes while undergoing scanning.\n* Women of childbearing potential must not be pregnant or breastfeeding.\n* Recent anatomic imaging with visible disease (tumor) for comparison with the PET/CT. .\n* Physical exam within 28 days of PET imaging, CBC and Multiphasic (including electrolytes, BUN, creatinine, total bilirubin, AST and ALT) within 14 days.\n* Patients must sign an informed consent indicating that they are aware of the investigational nature of this study.\n\nInclusion Criteria Specific for Intracranial Tumors\n\n- Clinical and MRI diagnosis of an intracranial lesion suspicious for a brain tumor, including gliomas or metastatic brain tumors; primary, residual, or recurrent brain tumors (judged by clinical imaging) will qualify.\n\nInclusion Criteria Specific for Extracranial Neuroendocrine Tumors:\n\n* Histopathologically confirmed, well-differentiated metastatic neuroendocrine tumor.\n* ECOG performance status of 2 or better.\n* Patients receiving stable-dose somatostatin analogs (SSAs, long-acting release [LAR], depot) for >3 months before enrollment may be enrolled on the study, but such treatment is not required.\n\nInclusion Criteria specific for Extracranial Primary Breast tumors:\n\n* Clinical and radiological diagnosis of a breast cancer\n* ECOG performance status of 2 or better.\n\nInclusion Criteria specific for Rectal tumors:\n\n* Histologically confirmed colorectal cancer, which is located in the rectum.\n* ECOG performance status of 2 or better.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Patients who are pregnant or lactating are excluded.\n\nExclusion Criteria Specific for Intracranial Tumors:\n\n* Severe increased intracranial pressure, status epilepticus, or other symptoms requiring emergency or urgent intervention.\n* Tumor surgery or radiation within 1 month prior to the PET scan\n\nExclusion Criteria Specific for Extracranial Neuroendocrine Tumors:\n\n* Tumor-directed therapy within 3 months to the area of planned imaging.\n* Ongoing treatment with a targeted agent (e.g., sunitinib or everolimus) or receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy (e.g., capecitabine or temozolomide).\n* Use of telotristat ethyl (a tryptophan-hydroxylase inhibitor) within one month.\n\nExclusion Criteria for Extracranial Primary Breast tumors:\n\n-Recent (within 1 month) tumor resection or radio-chemotherapy (acute/subacute post-treatment inflammatory changes may cause false positive increases on PET).\n\nExclusion Criteria for Rectal tumors:\n\n-Active inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's or Ulcerative colitis) involving the rectum.",
