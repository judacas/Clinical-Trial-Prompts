Azoospermic males and WOCBP who are continuously not heterosexually active are exempt from contraceptive requirements. However they must still undergo pregnancy testing as described in this section. Investigators shall counsel WOCBP and male subjects who are sexually active with WOCBP on the importance of pregnancy prevention and the implications of an unexpected pregnancy.\n  9. Investigators shall advise WOCBP and male subjects who are sexually active with WOCBP on the use of highly effective methods of contraception. Highly effective methods of contraception have a failure rate of < 1% when used consistently and correctly.\n  10. At a minimum, subjects must agree to use one highly effective method of contraception as listed below.\n* Highly effective methods of contraception\n\n  1. Highly effective methods of contraception have a failure rate of < 1% when used consistently and correctly.

Male subjects must inform their female partners who are WOCBP of the contraceptive requirements of the protocol and are expected to adhere to using contraception with their partner.\n\n     1. Progestogen only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation.\n     2. Hormonal methods of contraception including oral contraceptive pills containing estrogen + progesterone, vaginal ring, injectables, implants and intrauterine devices (IUDs) such as Mirena\n     3.

Complete abstinence- Complete abstinence is defined as the complete avoidance of heterosexual intercourse\n\n     1. complete abstinence is an acceptable form of contraception for all study drugs and must be used throughout the duration of the study treatment (plus 5 half-lives of the investigational drug plus 30 days).\n     2. It is not necessary to use any other method of contraception when complete abstinence is elected.\n     3. Subjects who choose complete abstinence must continue to have pregnancy tests\n     4. Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective contraception must be discussed in the event that the subject chooses to forego complete abstinence.\n     5. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject.\n* Unacceptable methods of contraception\n\n  1. Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods)\n  2. Withdrawal (coitus interruptus)\n  3. Spermicide only\n  4.

Concomitant medical conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator, might place the subject at unacceptable risk for participation in this study. 14.
