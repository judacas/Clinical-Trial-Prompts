    "official_title": "An Open-Label, Phase 2 Trial to Investigate the Humoral and Cell-Mediated Immune Responses and Safety of a Tetravalent Dengue Vaccine Candidate (TDV) Administered Subcutaneously in Flavivirus-Naïve and Dengue-Immune Healthy Adults",
    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Who are in good health at the time of entry into the trial as determined by medical history, physical examination (including vital signs) and clinical judgment of the investigator.\n2. Group 1 only: immunologically naïve to dengue, Zika, Yellow Fever (YF), Japanese Encephalitis (JE), West Nile (WN) (based on negative results for detection of anti-DENV, anti-Zika, anti-YF, anti-JE, anti-WN antibodies) as documented by serological testing performed by the trial center outside the scope of this trial (up to 70 days [10 weeks] prior to Day 1 [Month 0]).\n3. Group 2 only: serology consistent with primary infection with either DENV-1 or DENV-3 (defined as detectable neutralizing antibodies against DENV-1 or DENV-3 only, or titers for DENV-1 or DENV-3 ≥4-times higher than titers for the 2 other dengue serotypes) as documented by serological testing performed by the trial center outside the scope of this trial (up to 70 days [10 weeks] prior to Day 1 [Month 0]).\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 60 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Has clinically active significant infection (as assessed by the investigator) or body temperature ≥38°C (100.4°F) within 3 days of the intended date of vaccination.\n2. Has history of progressive or severe neurologic disorder, seizure disorder or neuro-inflammatory disease (eg, Guillain-Barré syndrome).\n3. Known or suspected impairment/alteration of immune function including:\n\n   1. Chronic use of oral steroids (equivalent to 20 mg/day prednisone ≥12 weeks and/or ≥2 mg/kg body weight/day prednisone ≥2 weeks) within 60 days prior to Day 1 (Month 0) (use of inhaled, intranasal, or topical corticosteroids is allowed).\n   2. Receipt of parenteral steroids (equivalent to 20 mg/day prednisone ≥12 weeks and/or ≥2 mg/kg body weight/day prednisone ≥2 weeks) within 60 days prior to Day 1 (Month 0).\n   3. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within 3 months prior to Day 1 (Month 0) or planned administration during the trial.\n   4. Receipt of immunostimulants within 60 days prior to Day 1 (Month 0).\n   5. Immunosuppressive therapy such as anti-cancer chemotherapy or radiation therapy within 6 months prior to Day 1 (Month 0).\n   6. Known Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection or HIV-related disease.\n   7. Hepatitis C virus infection.\n   8. Genetic immunodeficiency.\n4. Has planned vaccination (during the trial conduct) against any non-dengue flavivirus (eg, Zika, YF, JE, WN, tick-borne encephalitis, or Murray-Valley encephalitis).\n5. Planned travel (during the trial conduct) to any area endemic for dengue.",
