Patients who have received prior BTK inhibitor therapy are eligible, unless they demonstrated primary or acquired resistance to a BTK inhibitor or experienced a serious or severe adverse event attributed to BTK inhibitor therapy.\n7. Presence of radiographically measurable lymphadenopathy or extranodal lymphoid malignancy (defined as the presence of ≥1 non-biopsied, non-irradiated lesion that measures >1.5 cm in the longest dimension [LD] and ≥1.0 cm in the longest perpendicular dimension [LPD] as assessed by computed tomography [CT] or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]).\n8. Current medical need for therapy due to disease-related symptoms, lymphadenopathy, organomegaly, extranodal organ involvement, or progressive disease.\n9. Completion of all previous therapy (including any Bcl-2 or PI3K inhibitor therapy, surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or investigational therapy) for the treatment of cancer ≥1 week (or ≥3 half-lives of the previous drug) before the start of study therapy.\n10. All acute toxic effects of any prior antitumor therapy resolved to Grade ≤1 before the start of study therapy (with the exceptions of alopecia, or neurotoxicity [Grade 1 or 2 permitted], or selected laboratory parameters [Grade 1 or Grade 2 permitted with exceptions as noted below]).\n11. Adequate bone marrow function:\n\n    1. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1.0 × 109/L.\n    2. Platelet count ≥50 × 109/L.\n    3. Hemoglobin ≥8.0 g/dL maintained for ≥1 week from any prior transfusion.\n12. Adequate hepatic profile:\n\n    1. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤3 × upper limit of normal (ULN).\n    2. Serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤3 × ULN.\n    3. Serum bilirubin ≤1.5 × ULN unless elevated due to Gilbert syndrome.\n13. Adequate renal function:\n\n    1. Estimated creatinine clearance (eClCR) >30 mL/minute (with eClCR to be calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault formula [see Appendix 12.2]), or\n    2. Measured creatinine clearance >30 mL/minute (as assessed with a 24-hour urine collection).\n14. Adequate coagulation profile:\n\n    1. Prothrombin time (PT) ≤1.5 × ULN.\n    2. Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) ≤1.5 × ULN.\n15. Negative viral serology:\n\n    1. Negative human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody.\n    2. Negative hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and negative hepatitis B core (HBc) antibody or undetectable hepatitis B (HBV) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing.\n    3. Negative hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody or negative HCV RNA by quantitative PCR.\n16. For female patients of childbearing potential, a negative urine or serum pregnancy test prior to the start of study therapy.\n17. For female patients of childbearing potential, willingness to use a highly effective method of contraception from the start of the screening period until ≥3 months after the last dose of cirmtuzumab and ≥1 month after the last dose of ibrutinib, whichever is later. Note: A female patient is considered to be of childbearing potential unless she has had a hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy; has medically documented ovarian failure (with serum estradiol and follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH] levels within the institutional laboratory postmenopausal range and a negative serum or urine beta human chorionic gonadotropin [βHCG]); or is menopausal (age ≥50 years with amenorrhea for ≥6 months).\n18. For male patients who can father a child and are having intercourse with females of childbearing potential who are not using adequate contraception, willingness to use an effective method of contraception from the start of study therapy until ≥3 months after the last dose of cirmtuzumab and ≥3 months after the last dose of ibrutinib, whichever is later and to refrain from sperm donation from the start of study therapy until ≥3 months after administration of the final dose of either of the study drugs. Note: A male patient is considered able to father a child unless he has had a bilateral vasectomy with documented aspermia or a bilateral orchiectomy.\n19. In the judgment of the investigator, participation in the protocol offers an acceptable benefit-to-risk ratio when considering current disease status, medical condition, and the potential benefits and risks of alternative treatments for the patient's cancer.\n20. Willingness and ability of the patient to comply with scheduled visits, drug administration plan, protocol-specified laboratory tests, other study procedures, and study restrictions.\n21. Evidence of a personally signed informed consent indicating that the patient is aware of the neoplastic nature of the disease and has been informed of the procedures to be followed, the experimental nature of the therapy, alternatives, potential risks and discomforts, potential benefits, and other pertinent aspects of study participation.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Known histological transformation to an aggressive lymphoma (ie, Richter transformation).\n2. Known central nervous system malignancy.\n3. Presence of another cancer with disease manifestations or therapy that could adversely affect subject safety or longevity, create the potential for drug-drug interactions, or compromise the interpretation of study results.\n4. Significant cardiovascular disease (eg, myocardial infarction, arterial thromboembolism, cerebrovascular thromboembolism) within 3 months prior to start of study therapy; angina requiring therapy; symptomatic peripheral vascular disease; New York Heart Association Class 3 or 4 congestive heart failure; or uncontrolled Grade ≥3 hypertension (diastolic blood pressure ≥100 mmHg or systolic blood pressure ≥160 mmHg) despite antihypertensive therapy.\n5. Significant screening ECG abnormalities, including unstable cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication, atrial fibrillation/flutter, left bundle branch block, 2nd-degree atrioventricular (AV) block type II, 3rd-degree AV block, or Grade ≥2 bradycardia.\n6. Gastrointestinal disease (eg, gastric or intestinal bypass surgery, pancreatic enzyme insufficiency, malabsorption syndrome, symptomatic inflammatory bowel disease, chronic diarrheal illness, bowel obstruction) that might interfere with drug absorption or with interpretation of gastrointestinal AEs.\n7. Contraindication for ibrutinib use because of bleeding diathesis.\n8. Evidence of an ongoing systemic bacterial, fungal, or viral infection (including upper respiratory tract infections) at the time of start of study therapy. Note: Patients with localized fungal infections of skin or nails are not precluded from participation.\n9. In patients with prior hematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation, evidence of ongoing graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).\n10. Pregnancy or breastfeeding.\n11. Major surgery within 4 weeks before the start of study therapy.\n12. Prior solid organ transplantation.\n13. Prior anti-ROR1 therapy within 12 weeks prior to the start of study therapy.\n14.
