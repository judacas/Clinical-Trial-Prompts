    "official_title": "A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-Blind Study of Pembrolizumab Versus Placebo in Combination With Paclitaxel With or Without Bevacizumab for the Treatment of Platinum-resistant Recurrent Ovarian Cancer (KEYNOTE-B96/ENGOT-ov65)",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Has histologically confirmed epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma.\n* Has received 1 or 2 prior lines of systemic therapy for ovarian cancer (OC), including at least 1 prior platinum-based therapy. Participants may have received a prior poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor (PARPi), anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 therapy, bevacizumab, or hormonal therapy; these will not be considered a separate line of therapy. Any chemotherapy regimen change due to toxicity in the absence of disease progression will be considered part of the same line of therapy.\n* Has provided documented informed consent for the study.\n* Has radiographic evidence of disease progression within 6 months (180 days) after the last dose of platinum-based chemotherapy for OC (i.e., platinum-resistant disease).\n* Is a candidate for paclitaxel chemotherapy (and bevacizumab, if using).\n* Has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1 assessed within 3 days before randomization.\n* For a female participant, she is not pregnant or breastfeeding, and at least one of the following conditions applies: Is not a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) OR Is a WOCBP and uses a contraceptive method that is highly effective (with a failure rate of <1% per year).\n* Has radiographically evaluable disease, either measurable or nonmeasurable per RECIST 1.1, as assessed by the local site investigator.\n* Archival tumor tissue sample or newly obtained core or incisional/excisional biopsy of a tumor lesion not previously irradiated has been provided.\n* Have adequate organ function.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be FEMALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Has nonepithelial cancers, borderline tumors, mucinous, seromucinous that is predominantly mucinous, malignant Brenner's tumor and undifferentiated carcinoma.\n* Has primary platinum-refractory disease, defined as disease that has progressed per radiographic imaging while receiving or within 28 days of the last dose of first-line platinum-based therapy.\n* Has prior disease progression on weekly paclitaxel alone.\n* Has received >2 prior lines of systemic therapy for OC.\n* Has received prior systemic anticancer therapy including investigational agents or maintenance therapy (including bevacizumab maintenance therapy), within 4 weeks before randomization.\n* Has received prior radiation therapy within 2 weeks of start of study intervention.\n* Has not recovered adequately from surgery and/or any complications from the surgery.\n* Has received colony-stimulating factors (e.g., granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF], granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor,[GM-CSF] or recombinant erythropoietin) within 4 weeks before randomization.\n* Has received a live or live-attenuated vaccine within 30 days before the first dose of study intervention.\n* Has received investigational agent or has used an investigational device within 4 weeks prior to study intervention.\n* Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy.\n* Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or has required active treatment within the past 3 years.\n* Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis.\n* Has severe hypersensitivity (â‰¥Grade 3) to pembrolizumab, paclitaxel, or bevacizumab (if using) and/or any of their excipients.\n* Has an active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years.\n* Has a history of (noninfectious) pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease that required steroids or has current pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease.\n* Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.\n* Has a known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.\n* Has a known history of Hepatitis B or known active Hepatitis C virus infection.\n* Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, laboratory abnormality, or other circumstance that might confound the results of the study.\n* Has a known psychiatric or substance abuse disorder that would interfere with the participant's ability to cooperate with the requirements of the study.\n* Participant, in the judgement of the investigator, is unlikely to comply with the study procedures, restrictions, and requirements of the study.\n* Has had an allogenic tissue/solid organ transplant.\n\nFor bevacizumab treatment\n\n* Has uncontrolled hypertension.\n* Has current, clinically relevant bowel obstruction including related to underlying epithelial OC, abdominal fistula or gastrointestinal perforation, intra-abdominal abscess, or evidence of rectosigmoid involvement by pelvic exam.\n* Has a history of thrombotic disorders, hemorrhage, hemoptysis, or active gastrointestinal bleeding within 6 months before randomization.",
