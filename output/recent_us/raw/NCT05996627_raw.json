    "official_title": "A Feasibility Trial of Alternating Intravaginal Application of 5-Fluorouracil and Imiquimod for Treatment of High-Grade Cervical Squamous Intraepithelial Lesions",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Women with biopsy confirmed high grade cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions (i.e., cervical squamous intraepithelial neoplasia 3 [CIN3] lesions, and cervical squamous epithelial neoplasia 2 [CIN2] lesions with diagnosis confirmed by positive p16 immunohistochemistry staining) within 12 weeks of baseline visit\n* Karnofsky >= 70%\n* Leukocytes >= 3,000/microliter\n* Absolute neutrophil count >= 1,500/microliter\n* Platelets >= 100,000/microliter\n* Serum creatinine =< the upper institutional limits\n* Participants must have a negative human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody/antigen test and negative Chlamydia (C.) trachomatis/Neisseria (N.) gonorrhea nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT)\n* Agree to use an effective form of contraception; the effects of intravaginal 5-fluorocuracil and imiquimod on the developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic dose are unknown; for this reason and because 5- fluorouracil is known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate dual methods of contraception (hormonal method of birth control, intrauterine device, or tubal ligation - plus condoms) or abstinence prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her study physician immediately\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be FEMALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 45 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Women treated previously with 5-fluorouracil or imiquimod or other medications for high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions will be excluded from the study\n* Concurrent vaginal, vulvar, anal lesions or symptomatic infections\n* Pregnant or planning pregnancy within the next 6 months, or breastfeeding; pregnant women are excluded from this study because 5-fluorouracil is an antimetabolite with the potential for teratogenic effects; because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events (AEs) in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with 5-fluorouracil, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with 5-fluorouracil\n* Inability to speak or read English or Spanish\n* Prior hysterectomy\n* Use of anticoagulant medications\n* Subjects who have a known immunocompromised condition (HIV positive [+], use of immunosuppressive medications or systemic steroids, organ transplant recipients) or autoimmune conditions (e.g. psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis or other known autoimmune conditions)\n* Evidence of invasive anal, vulva, vaginal, or cervical carcinoma; prior loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) or ablative treatment within 6 months prior to study entry; other invasive malignancies, with the exception of non-melanoma skin cancer, within the last 5 years\n* Pathologic findings consistent with\n\n  * Atypical endometrial cells or serious glandular-cell atypia (atypical glandular cells, favor neoplasia cytology diagnosis)\n  * Evidence of cervical carcinoma on Pap smear or biopsy\n  * More than two cervical quadrants of CIN 3 as visualized by colposcopy\n  * Nonvisual squamous columnar junction on colposcopy with no concurrent endocervical sampling performed\n* Use of other investigational agents within 6 months prior to enrollment\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to 5-fluorouracil or imiquimod\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection (other than human papilloma virus [HPV]), symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements\n* Subjects with known partial or complete dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) enzyme deficiency",
