Platelet count ≥75×109/L with no platelet transfusions in the past 7 days\n   2. Absolute neutrophil count ≥1.0×109/L\n   3. Hemoglobin ≥8 g/dL (red blood cell transfusion may be used to reach 8 g/dL but must have been administered at least 1 week prior to the administration of the study drug)\n   4. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) <2.5× the upper limit of normal (ULN) if no hepatic metastases are present; <5× ULN if hepatic metastases are present\n   5. Total bilirubin <1.5× ULN; <3 X ULN in the presence of Gilbert's disease\n   6. Estimated (Cockcroft-Gault formula) or measured creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min\n   7. International normalized ratio (INR) ≤1.5× ULN unless participant is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as the prothrombin time (PT) or activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants\n7. If female of childbearing potential, either abstain from sexual intercourse or employ highly effective contraception measures during the study and for ≥30 days after the administration of the study drug. Highly effective measures include 2 forms of contraception. Postmenopausal or surgically sterile women (ie, hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy) are eligible. Postmenopausal status is defined as either: amenorrheic for ≥12 months following cessation of exogenous hormonal treatments and without an alternative medical cause; luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone levels in the postmenopausal range for women <50 years of age; radiation-induced ovarian ablation with last menses ≥1 year ago; or chemotherapy-induced menopause with a ≥1-year interval since last menses. Female subjects must refrain from donating or banking eggs (ova, oocytes) and retrieving eggs for use during study treatment and for 30 days after the administration of the study drug.\n8. For male subjects not surgically sterile, must either abstain from sexual intercourse or employ highly effective contraception (condoms or other barrier forms of contraception) during the study and for at least 30 days after the administration of the study drug. Male subjects should also avoid semen donation or providing semen for in vitro fertilization during the above-mentioned duration.\n9.

Have central nervous system (CNS) metastases or primary CNS tumor that is associated with progressive neurologic symptoms or requires ongoing corticosteroids to control the CNS disease. Subjects must have a stable neurologic status without steroid support for ≥2 weeks before the start of study drug administration. Subjects with stable or asymptomatic CNS metastases or primary CNS are eligible.\n5. Require treatment with traditional/herbal medicines or their preparations indicated for tumors or with adjuvant anti-tumor effects that cannot be discontinued during the study.\n6. Have clinically significant, uncontrolled cardiovascular disease including congestive heart failure Class III or Class IV according to the New York Heart Association classification; myocardial infarction or unstable angina within the previous 6 months; uncontrolled hypertension (Grade ≥3); or clinically significant, uncontrolled arrhythmia, including bradyarrhythmia that may cause QT prolongation (eg, Type II second-degree heart block or third-degree heart block).\n7. Have QT interval corrected using Fridericia's formula >480 msec. Unless the subject has a history of prolonged QT syndrome or torsade de pointes or a familial history of prolonged QT syndrome.\n8. Have a history of acute ischemic stroke, diagnosed by imaging (CT or MRI) or clinical diagnosis within 6 months prior to screening.\n9. Have any severe or uncontrolled systemic disease or condition per clinical judgement, including: (i) uncontrolled hypertension or diabetes; (ii) serious cardiac, pulmonary, or renal conditions; (iii) active bleeding diatheses; (iv) any active type of bacterial, viral, fungal, or other infection that would pose a significant risk to the subject in the opinion of the Investigator; (v) cerebrovascular accident within the last 6 months before administration of study drug.\n10. Have received a major surgical procedure within 28 days before the start of study drug administration (procedures such as central venous catheter placement and tumor needle biopsy are not considered major surgical procedures). The study center should discuss other minor surgeries with the sponsor.\n11. Clinical diagnosis of hemochromatosis or secondary iron overload,\n12. Have known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus, or hepatitis C virus infection that is not well-controlled and meets any of the following exclusion criteria:\n\n    1.
