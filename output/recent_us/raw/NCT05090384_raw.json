    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Female, age at least 18 years\n2. ECOG performance status of <2\n3. Written voluntary informed consent\n4. Histologically diagnosed Uterine Serous Carcinoma.\n5. Patient must agree to undergo Foundation One testing.\n6. Patient diagnosed with advanced stage USC including stage III, stage IV, or platinum-sensitive recurrent USC\n7. If recurrent USC, patient must have platinum sensitive disease after initial treatment; defined as achieving a response (CR or PR) and disease progression >6 months after completion of their last dose of platinum chemotherapy.\n8. Patients eligible if receiving 1st or 2nd line chemotherapy for recurrence.\n9. The patient must have achieved a partial, stable, or complete tumor response following the last chemotherapy (minimal of 3 cycles) regimen of physician choice chemotherapy indicating partial, stable, complete tumor response.\n10. Patients must receive Niraparib maintenance within 12 weeks after completion of their final dose of chemotherapy regimen or within 14 weeks if received radiation therapy. CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis will be performed within 28 days of starting Niraparib.\n11. Lesions can be non-measurable or measurable by RECIST 1.1 criteria.\n12.

Non childbearing potential is defined as follows (by other than medical reasons):\n\n    1. ≥45 years of age and has not had menses for >1 year Patients who have been amenorrhoeic for <2 years without history of a hysterectomy and oophorectomy must have a follicle stimulating hormone value in the postmenopausal range upon screening evaluation Post-hysterectomy, post-bilateral oophorectomy, or post-tubal ligation. Documented hysterectomy or oophorectomy must be confirmed with medical records of the actual procedure or confirmed by an ultrasound. Tubal ligation must be confirmed with medical records of the actual procedure, otherwise the patient must be willing to use 2 adequate barrier methods throughout the study, starting with the screening visit through 180 days after the last dose of study treatment. See Section 6.4 for a list of acceptable birth control methods. Information must be captured appropriately within the site's source documents. Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the established and preferred contraception for the patient.\n    2. Participant must agree to not breastfeed during the study or for 180 days after the last dose of study treatment.\n    3.
