    "official_title": "A Pilot Study Investigating Intrahepatic Arterial And Intravenous Infusion Of The Radiolabeled Somatostatin Agonist 177Lu-DOTATATE In Patients With Liver-Dominant Metastatic Gastroenteropancreatic (GEP), Bronchial or Unknown Primary Well Differentiated Neuroendocrine Tumors",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Subjects affected by histologically proven, somatostatin-receptor positive, progressive, nonresectable, liver-dominant metastatic GEP, bronchial or unknown primary tumors, G1, G2 and G3, according to the new WHO classification of 2017.\n\n  1. Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent document\n  2. Aged 18 years or older\n  3. Histologically proven or cytologically confirmed, non-resectable,GEP, bronchial or unknown primary NETs with liver-dominant disease with or without prior treatment with embolization\n  4. Measurable disease as defined by RECIST 1.1 with at least one dimension ≥ 1.0 cm\n  5. GEP or unknown primary NET of grade 1, 2 and 3 according to WHO 2017, typical or atypical lung carcinoid according to the Travis classification of 2004\n  6. Progression of disease defined by one of the following occurring within 6 months of study entry:\n\n     1. At least a 20% increase in radiologically or clinically measurable disease;\n     2. Appearance of any new lesion;\n     3. Symptomatic disease (including worsening hormonal symptoms or symptoms related to tumor burden);\n  7. Overexpression of somatostatin receptors of the target lesions at 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT with SUV of lesions greater than normal liver at least in 1 metastasis.\n  8. ECOG performance status 0 or 1 (Karnofsky ≥ 70%).\n  9. Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation.\n  10. Previous local therapy (e.g., chemoembolization or bland embolization) is allowed if completed >6 weeks prior to study entry. For such patients, there must be either progression of measurable disease documented within the treatment field, or measurable progressive disease outside the treatment field prior to study entry.\n  11. Previous oral chemotherapy, biotherapy (such as Interferons or Everolimus) and/or investigational agents are allowed if completed >4 weeks prior to study entry For patients who received systemic therapy prior to study entry, there must be documented progression of measurable disease since receiving systemic therapy prior to study entry.\n  12. Patients must not be candidate for potentially curative surgery. Prior surgery is allowed no less than 6 weeks prior to study entry. Note: Patients who have disease that is amendable to resection but who are not a surgical candidate for other medical reasons would be permitted.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",

Uncontrolled, intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n20. Prior external beam radiation therapy involving >25% of the bone marrow.\n21. Unmanageable urinary incontinence rendering the administration of 177Lu-DOTATATE unsafe\n22. Other known co-existing malignancies except non-melanoma skin cancer and carcinoma in situ of the uterine cervix, unless definitively treated and with no evidence of recurrence.",
