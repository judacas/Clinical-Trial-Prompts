    "official_title": "A Phase 1/1b, Multicenter, Open-label, Dose Escalation and Expansion Study Evaluating the Safety, Pharmacodynamics, and Pharmacokinetics of ODC-IL2 Administered Via Intravenous Infusion in Adult Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors",
    "inclusion_criteria": "Each patient must meet all the following criteria to participate in the study:\n\n1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced or metastatic solid tumors, for which no other standard treatment is available or appropriate, or for which the Trutino Biosciences Protocol #: TRT-ODC-IL2-001 Version: 1.0 Date: 20 September 2024 standard of care is refused by the patient due to tolerability or the Investigator believes the patient will not tolerate standard-of-care therapy\n2. Advanced or metastatic tumors measurable per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria;\n3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1;\n4. Life expectancy of at least 3 months;\n5. Age ≥ 18 years;\n6. Signed, written Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Ethics Committee (EC)-approved informed consent\n7. Acceptable liver function:\n\n   * Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) or ≤ 5 × institutional ULN for patients who have serum bilirubin increases due to underlying Gilbert's Syndrome (familial benign unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia).\n   * Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 x ULN (if liver metastases are present, then ≤ 5 x ULN is allowed)\n8. Acceptable renal function:\n\n   • Calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min using the Cockcroft-Gault equation.\n9. Acceptable hematologic status:\n\n   * Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1500 cells/mm3\n   * Platelet count ≥ 75,000 (plt/mm3)\n   * Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL\n10. A negative serum pregnancy test (if a woman of childbearing potential);\n11. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) and men with WOCBP partners must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal method of birth control; intrauterine devices or abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation and for 4 months after the last dose of study drug. Should a female trial participant or a female partner of a male trial participant become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant during the study, the Investigator must be informed immediately.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. New York Heart Association Class III or IV, cardiac disease, myocardial infarction within the past 6 months, unstable arrhythmia, or evidence of ischemia on electrocardiogram (ECG)\n2. Have a corrected QT interval (using Fridericia's correction formula) (QTcF) of > 470 msec\n3. Active, uncontrolled bacterial, viral, or fungal infections, requiring systemic therapy\n4. Known active brain metastases; patients with previously treated, clinically stable, radiologically stable brain metastases (without evidence of progression in 4 weeks) and without the requirement for treatment with corticosteroids in prior 3 weeks may be considered for enrollment after discussion with the Medical Monitor\n5. History of prior organ transplant\n6. Conditions requiring systemic treatment with corticosteroids or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to start of study drug.\n7. History of autoimmune diseases requiring systemic immunosuppressive therapy in the last 2 years\n8. Pregnant or nursing women.\n9. Treatment with radiation therapy, major surgery, chemotherapy, or investigational therapy within 4 weeks prior to study entry (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C). Radiation for palliation of pain is allowed within 1 week prior to study entry, but the lesion should not be selected as a target lesion for RECIST analysis.\n10. Unwillingness or inability to comply with procedures required in this protocol\n11. Known active infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human T-cell leukemia virus, type 1 (HTLV-1), hepatitis B virus (HBV), or hepatitis C virus (HCV)\n\n    * Patients with a history of hepatitis B or C are allowed if HBV DNA or HCV RNA are undetectable\n    * Active infection with HIV and CD4+ T-cell count <350/μL. Patients not on established anti-retroviral therapy for at least 4 weeks and having a detectable HIV viral load\n12. Serious uncontrolled nonmalignant disease (e.g., renal failure, liver failure, or other conditions) that could compromise protocol objectives in the opinion of the investigator and/or the sponsor\n13. Prior treatment with an IL-2 targeted treatment, unless given as a part of a tumor infiltrating lymphocyte treatment combination;\n14. Known sensitivity to IL-2 or any of the excipients in ODC-IL2;\n15. Active treatment with heparin or heparin-related therapies, unless the patient can be transitioned to a non-heparin treatment for the clinical condition with an adequate washout prior to enrollment in the study.",
