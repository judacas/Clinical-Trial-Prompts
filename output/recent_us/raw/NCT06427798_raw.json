Participants are allowed to continue steroid taper during the start of study treatment.\n* Prior treatment with any other investigational drug or biologic agent or radiation therapy before a washout has been completed (must be completed prior to randomization):\n\n  1. 2 weeks (14 days) or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter, for chemotherapeutic agents, small molecules, and checkpoint inhibitors\n  2. 3 weeks (21 days) or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter, for antibody-drug conjugates\n  3. 4 weeks (28 days) for cell therapies\n  4. 2 weeks (14 days) for radiation therapy\n* Any unresolved and significant toxicity (National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [NCI-CTCAE] version 5.0) Grade > 2 from previous anticancer therapy (including radiation therapy), other than alopecia\n* Significant cardiovascular disease, including: Cardiac failure New York Heart Association class III or IV; Myocardial infarction, severe or unstable angina within 6 months prior to randomization; History of serious ventricular arrhythmia (i.e., ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation)\n* Any other medical condition or psychiatric condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, might interfere with the participant's involvement in the study or interfere with the interpretation of study results\n* History of prior malignancy within 2 years prior to randomization (except for adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer, carcinoma in situ of the breast or cervix, superficial bladder cancer, or early-stage prostate cancer, without evidence of recurrence; participants may or may not be on maintenance therapy)\n* Participants who are positive for HBV or HCV with indication of acute or chronic hepatitis (as defined in protocol)\n* Radiographic evidence (historical or at screening) of interstitial lung disease or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis\n* Female participants who are pregnant or breastfeeding\n\nA full list of inclusion and exclusion criteria can be found in the protocol.",
