Must be off any systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of symptomatic brain metastases for at least 14 days prior to enrollment.\n* Severe or unstable medical condition, such as congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] Class III or Class IV), ischemic heart disease, uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, psychiatric condition, as well as an uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication (≥Grade 2, according to NCI CTCAE Version 5), myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to starting study treatment, or any other significant or unstable concurrent cardiac illness. Note: Stable chronic atrial fibrillation is allowed.\n* Use of strong inhibitors of CYP3A within 14 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) or grapefruit juice or grapefruit containing products within 7 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1.\n* Use of strong inducers of CYP3A within 14 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to Cycle 1 Day 1.\n* Use of strong inhibitors of cytochrome CYP2D6 within 14 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to Cycle 1 Day 1.\n* Use of strong inducers of CYP2D6 within 14 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to Cycle 1 Day 1.\n* History of other previous or concurrent cancer that would interfere with the determination of safety or efficacy assessment\n* Surgery (eg, stomach bypass) or medical condition that might significantly affect absorption of medicines\n* Other criteria may apply",
