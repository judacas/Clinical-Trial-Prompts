    "inclusion_criteria": "Subjects must satisfy the following criteria to be enrolled in the study (with the enrollment date defined as the date in which the subject is assigned a cohort in Integrated Response Technology [IRT]) and receive their first dose of luspatercept:\n\n1. Subject is ≥18 years of age at the time of signing the informed consent form (ICF).\n2. Subject has Myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN)-associated myelofibrosis (PMF, post- Post-polycythemia vera myelofibrosis (PV MF), and/or Post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis (post-ET MF)) as confirmed from the most recent local bone marrow biopsy report according to the World Health Organization 2016 criteria.\n3. Subject has anemia defined as:\n\n   1.

There must be ≥ 14 days in between each Hgb measurement. No subjects with an interval ≥ 42 days between hemoglobin measurements will be enrolled.\n      * There must not be any Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions within the 84-day period immediately up to the C1D1 date.\n   2. Cohorts 2 and 3B\n\n      * Average RBC-transfusion frequency: 4 to 12 RBC units/84 days immediately up to the C1D1 date. There must be no interval > 56 days without ≥ 1 RBC-transfusion.\n      * Subjects must have a Hgb value of < 13 g/dL on C1D1 prior to luspatercept administration.\n      * Only RBC transfusions given when the Hgb ≤ 9.5 g/dL are scored in determining eligibility.\n4.

A female of childbearing potential (FCBP) for this study is defined as a female who: 1) has achieved menarche at some point, 2) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or 3) has not been naturally postmenopausal (amenorrhea following cancer therapy does not rule out childbearing potential) for at least 24 consecutive months (ie, has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months). FCBP participating in the study must:\n\n   1. Have 2 negative pregnancy tests as verified by the Investigator prior to starting study therapy. She must agree to ongoing pregnancy testing during the course of the study, and after end of study treatment. This applies even if the subject practices true abstinence* from heterosexual contact.\n   2. Either commit to true abstinence* from heterosexual contact (which must be reviewed on a monthly basis and source documented) or agree to use, and be able to comply with, effective contraception** without interruption, 28 days prior to starting investigational product, during the study therapy (including dose interruptions), and for 12 weeks (approximately 5 times the mean terminal halflife of luspatercept based on multiple-dose pharmacokinetics [PK] data) after discontinuation of study therapy.\n7. Male subjects must:\n\n   a. Practice true abstinence (which must be reviewed on a monthly basis) or agree to use a condom during sexual contact with a pregnant female or a female of childbearing potential while participating in the study, during dose interruptions and for at least 12 weeks (approximately 5 times the mean terminal half-life of luspatercept based on multiple-dose PK data) following investigational product discontinuation, even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy\n8. Subject must understand and voluntarily sign an ICF prior to any study-related assessments/procedures being conducted.\n9. Subject is willing and able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
