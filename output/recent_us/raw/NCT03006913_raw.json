    "inclusion_criteria": "* Subject must provide verbal informed consent for study participation prior to MTB case evaluation.\n* Tumor genetic profiling performed as standard of care must include ≥100 genes.\n* Tumor must contain at least one of the following genetic alterations: (A) an alteration known to be potentially associated with sensitization to a clinically available treatment. (the list of genetic alterations evolves as new information emerges and new drugs are developed); (B) an alteration suspected to be germline.\n* Subject must have ECOG Performance Status of 0 to 2.\n* Subject must have measurable or evaluable disease.\n* Subjects who have previously enrolled in this study can be enrolled a second time if they undergo genetic profiling of a tumor that was biopsied/sampled AFTER progression on an intervening line of treatment started after the time of first enrollment. Re-enrollment of such subjects must be noted in REDCap to facilitate longitudinal analysis.\n* Age ≥18 years.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Subjects with a tumor harboring a genetic alteration for which an FDA-approved drug is indicated that the patient has not yet received (example for exclusion: a melanoma with a BRAF-V600E mutation in a subject who has not yet been treated with a BRAF inhibitor).\n* Pregnant women.",
