    "official_title": "A Phase III, Open-label, Sponsor-blind, Randomized Study of Dato-DXd With or Without Osimertinib Versus Platinum-based Doublet Chemotherapy for Participants With EGFR-mutated Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Whose Disease Has Progressed on Prior Osimertinib Treatment (TROPION-Lung15)",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Histologically or cytologically confirmed non-squamous NSCLC.\n* Must have evidence of documented pre-existing EGFRm information (EGFRm known to be associated with (epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR] tyrosine kinase inhibitor [TKis] sensitivity [Ex19del, L858R, G719X, S768I, or L861Q], either alone or in combination with other EGFR mutations, which may include T790M).\n* Documented extra-cranial radiologic progression on prior osimertinib monotherapy (as most recent line of treatment) in the adjuvant, locally advanced, or metastatic setting.\n* Less than or equal to (<=2) prior lines of EGFR TKIs (osimertinib is the only permitted prior third generation EGFR TKI).\n* At least one lesion, not previously irradiated, that qualifies as a RECIST v1.1 TL at baseline and can be accurately measured at baseline.\n* World Health Organization (WHO)/Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.\n* Adequate bone marrow reserve and organ function within 7 days before randomization.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Use of chemotherapy, vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor, immunotherapy or any anti-cancer therapy in the metastatic setting. Platinum-based chemotherapy in non-metastatic setting within 12 months prior to randomization.\n* History of another primary malignancy except for malignancy treated with curative intent with no known active disease within 2 years before the first dose of study intervention.\n* Any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic diseases, including, but not limited to active bleeding diseases, active infection, active ILD/pneumonitis, cardiac disease.\n* Has significant third-space fluid retention (example [eg.], ascites or pleural effusion) as judged by the investigator and is not amenable for required repeated drainage.\n* History of non-infectious ILD/pneumonitis including radiation pneumonitis that required steroids or drug-induced ILD, has current ILD/pneumonitis, or has suspected ILD/pneumonitis that cannot be ruled out by imaging at screening.\n* Has severe pulmonary function compromise resulting from intercurrent pulmonary illnesses.\n* Unstable spinal cord compression and/or unstable brain metastases.\n* Participants with symptomatic brain metastases (including leptomeningeal involvement).\n* Clinically significant corneal disease.\n* Uncontrolled infection requiring IV antibiotics, antivirals, or antifungals, suspected infections or inability to rule out infections.\n* Has known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection that is not well controlled.",
