    "official_title": "Hyperpolarized Pyruvate Imaging of Glioma: Imaging-Pathological Correlation",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Written informed consent will be obtained from each participants including healthy volunteers.\n* Healthy volunteers will not have contra-indications to MR scanning, but will otherwise not be subject to other selection criteria.\n* All patients will be enrolled in study # 2011-0370, the Stereotactic RadPath trial\n* Patient is >18 years old, agrees to participate in the clinical study and to complete all required visits and evaluations. The pediatric population has a different disease profile from the glioma patients we hope to recruit. To reduce heterogeneity in the patient population we will not consider patients younger than 18 for this study.\n* Patient is a candidate for cerebral tumor resection with lesion suspected to be or previously biopsy proven to be a primary brain tumor.\n* Patient is able to understand and give consent to participation in the study.\n* Patient agrees to undergo, prior to the procedure, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI, within 14 days and preferably with 3 days of the planned procedure) with perfusion, diffusion and spectroscopic imaging.\n* Patient has a GFR > 60. In patients with moderate renal failure (GFR 30-60), an alternate injection with 2 times half-dose multihance (gadobenate dimeglumine) or gadovist (gadobutrol) will be considered, if a contrast exam is deemed clinically necessary.\n* Specifically for this Study: Patient is willing to give signed informed consent for C13-Pyruvate MR Spectroscopy.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 19 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Healthy volunteers will be screened using same process but will otherwise not be subject to other selection criteria.\n* The patient is found to have unfavorable anatomy to indicate that stereotactic biopsy could not be safely performed.\n* Pacemakers, electronic stimulation, metallic foreign bodies and devices and/or other conditions that are not MR safe, which include but are not limited to: • electronically, magnetically, and mechanically activated implants • ferromagnetic or electronically operated active devices like automatic cardioverter defibrillators and cardiac pacemakers • metallic splinters in the eye • ferromagnetic hemostatic clips in the central nervous system (CNS) or body • cochlear implants • other pacemakers, e.g., for the carotid sinus • insulin pumps and nerve stimulators • non-MR safe lead wires • prosthetic heart valves (if dehiscence is suspected) • non-ferromagnetic stapedial implants • pregnancy • claustrophobia that does not readily respond to oral medication\n* Prior brain tumor treatment, including surgical resection, radiation therapy or chemotherapy for a primary brain neoplasm. Previous biopsy will not disqualify the patient from participation. Remote history (> 6month) of non-CNS malignancy in remission, without evidence of current/ prior brain metastasis, will also not disqualify patient from participating.\n* History of cardiac arrhythmia",
