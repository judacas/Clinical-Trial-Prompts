Postmenopausal status is defined as:\n\n  * Amenorrheic for 1 year or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal treatments\n  * Luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels in the post-menopausal range for women under 50\n  * Radiation-induced oophorectomy with last menses > 1 year ago\n  * Chemotherapy-induced menopause with > 1-year interval since last menses\n  * Surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy)\n  * Women of childbearing potential and their partners, who are sexually active, must agree to the use of TWO highly effective forms of contraception in combination. This should be started from the signing of the informed consent and continue throughout the period of taking study treatment and for at least 3 months after last dose of study drug(s)\n  * Male patients must use a condom during treatment and for 3 months after the last dose of study treatment when having sexual intercourse with a pregnant woman or with a woman of childbearing potential. Female partners of male patients should also use a highly effective form of contraception if they are of childbearing potential. Male patients should not donate sperm throughout the period of taking study treatment and for 3 months following the last dose of study treatment\n* Subject is willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study including undergoing treatment and scheduled visits and examinations including follow-up\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Histology other than SCLC\n* Prior systemic therapy for ES-SCLC (e.g. chemotherapy, PARP inhibitor, other DNA damage response [DDR] inhibitors, PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors)\n* Patients with untreated brain metastases\n* Patients with spinal cord compression unless considered to have received definitive treatment for this and evidence of clinically stable disease for 28 days\n* Major surgical procedure (as defined by the Investigator) within 28 days prior to the first dose of study treatment and patients must have recovered from any effects of any major surgery.
