    "exclusion_criteria": "* Prior treatment for MDS with disease-modifying therapy (conventional or investigational) (i.e. hypomethylator therapy, lenalidomide, or prior AML-like induction therapy intended for the therapy of MDS). Use of prior growth factor and ESA support is permitted.\n* Currently receiving any other investigational agents.\n* A history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to CPX-351 or other agents used in the study.\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, or cardiac arrhythmia.\n* History of Wilson's disease or other copper-metabolism disorder.\n* Pregnant and/or breastfeeding.
