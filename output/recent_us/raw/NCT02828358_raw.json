Treatment with topical chemotherapy agents for precancerous skin conditions or skin cancers is allowed\n* Unresolved adverse events from prior treatment not resolved to grade ≤ 1 with the exception of alopecia or grade 2 peripheral neuropathy\n* History of allogeneic or autologous stem cell transplant (SCT) or chimeric antigen receptor-modified T cell (CAR-T) therapy within 60 days. Patients with a history of allogeneic stem cell transplant must be stable off all immunosuppression for at least 2 months prior to study screening. Presence of any of the following, regardless of prior SCT and/or CAR-T therapy timing will be exclusionary:\n\n  * Active graft versus host disease (GVHD)\n  * Cytopenia from incomplete blood cell count recovery post-transplant\n  * Need for anti-cytokine therapy for toxicity from CAR-T therapy and/or residual symptoms of neurotoxicity > grade 1 from CAR-T therapy\n  * Ongoing immunosuppressive therapy\n* Active second malignancy unless in remission and with life expectancy > 2 years. Adjuvant endocrine therapy for breast or prostate cancer that is expected to be cured is allowed. Non-melanoma skin cancers are permitted if adequately treated\n* Psychiatric illness, or social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements\n* Active uncontrolled auto-immune cytopenia (e.g., autoimmune hemolytic anemia [AIHA], idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura [ITP]) for which new therapy was introduced or existing therapy was escalated within the 4 weeks prior to study enrollment to maintain adequate blood counts\n* Evidence of other clinically significant uncontrolled condition(s) including but not limited to, uncontrolled systemic bacterial, viral, fungal or parasitic infection (except for fungal nail infection), or other clinically significant active disease process which in the opinion of the investigator may pose a risk for patient participation.

Patients with positive hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) and negative HBsAg require hepatitis B polymerase chain reaction (PCR) evaluation before inclusion. Patients who are hepatitis B PCR positive will be excluded\n  * Hepatitis C virus (HCV): positive hepatitis C antibody. If positive hepatitis C antibody result, patient will need to have a negative result for hepatitis C ribonucleic acid (RNA) before inclusion.
