    "exclusion_criteria": "<!-- -->\n\n1. A WOCBP who has a positive urine pregnancy test (e.g., within 72 hours) prior to treatment. If at any time, a urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required.\n2. Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent or with an agent directed to another stimulatory or co-inhibitory T-cell receptor (eg, CTLA-4, OX 40, CD137) other than for adjuvant or neoadjuvant treatment AND was discontinued from that treatment due to a Grade 3 or higher immune-related AE (irAE).\n3. Has received prior systemic anti-cancer therapy in the first line setting for the participant's metastatic disease (treatment with chemotherapy and/or radiation as part of neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy is allowed as long as completed at least 6 months prior to diagnosis of metastatic disease).\n4. Participants must have recovered from all AEs due to previous therapies to ≤Grade 1 or baseline. Participants with ≤Grade 2 neuropathy are eligible.\n5.

Has known active CNS metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Participants with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are radiologically stable, i.e., without evidence of progression for at least 4 weeks by repeat imaging (note that the repeat imaging should be performed during trial screening), clinically stable and without requirement of steroid treatment for at least 14 days prior to first dose of trial treatment.\n12.

Has an active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in past 2 years (i.e., with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency) is not considered a form of systemic treatment and is allowed.\n14. Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or has current pneumonitis.\n15. Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.\n16. Has a known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. No HIV testing is required unless mandated by local health authority.\n17.
