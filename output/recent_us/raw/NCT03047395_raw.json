    "official_title": "A Phase III, Multicenter, Randomized, Double-blind Study to Assess Efficacy and Safety of Two Doses of Crizanlizumab Versus Placebo, With or Without Hydroxyurea/ Hydroxycarbamide Therapy, in Adolescent and Adult Sickle Cell Disease Patients With Vaso-Occlusive Crises (STAND)",
    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Written informed consent must be obtained prior to any screening procedures\n2. Male or female patients aged 12 years and older on the day of signing informed consent. Adolescent include patients aged 12 to 17 years old and adults ≥ 18 years\n3. Confirmed diagnosis of SCD by hemoglobin electrophoresis or high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) [performed locally]. All SCD genotypes are eligible, genotyping is not required for study entry\n4. Experienced at least 2 VOCs leading to healthcare visit within the 12 months prior to screening visit as determined by medical history. Prior VOC leading to healthcare visit must resolve at least 7 days prior to Week 1 Day 1 and must include:\n\n   1. Pain crisis defined as an acute onset of pain for which there is no other medically determined explanation other than vaso- occlusion -\n   2. which requires a visit to a medical facility and/or healthcare professional,\n   3. and receipt of oral/parenteral opioids or parenteral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) analgesia Acute chest syndrome (ACS), priapism and hepatic or splenic sequestration will be considered VOC in this study\n5. If receiving HU/HC or L-glutamine (local HA approved medicinal product), must have been receiving the drug for at least 6 months and at a stable dose for at least 3 months prior to Screening visit and plan to continue taking it at the same dose and schedule until the subject has reached one year of study treatment. Patients who have not been receiving such drug must not have received it for at least 6 months prior to Screening visit to be included. Patients must have evidence of insufficient control of acute pain, such as at least one VOC leading to healthcare visit while on HU/HC or L-Glutamine treatment. If receiving erythropoietin stimulating agent, must have been receiving the drug for at least 6 months prior to Screening visit and plan to continue taking the treatment to maintain stable Hb levels at least until the subject has reached one year of study treatment\n6. Patients must meet the following central laboratory values prior to Week 1 Day 1:\n\n   * Absolute Neutrophil Count ≥1.0 x 109/L\n   * Platelet count ≥75 x 109/L\n   * Hemoglobin: for adults (Hb) ≥4.0 g/dL and for adolescents (Hb) ≥5.5 g/dL\n   * Glomerular filtration rate ≥ 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 using CKD-EPI formula in adults, and Shwartz formula in adolescents\n   * Direct (conjugated) bilirubin < 2.0 x ULN\n   * Alanine transaminase (ALT) < 3.0 x ULN\n7. ECOG performance status ≤2.0 for adults and Karnofsky ≥ 50% for adolescents\n\nKey\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 12 Years\nMust have maximum age of 100 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. History of stem cell transplant.\n2. Participating in a chronic transfusion program (pre-planned series of transfusions for prophylactic purposes) and/or planning on undergoing an exchange transfusion during the duration of the study; episodic transfusion in response to worsened anemia or VOC is permitted.\n3. Contraindication or hypersensitivity to any drug or metabolites from similar class as study drug or to any excipients of the study drug formulation. History of severe hypersensitivity reaction to other monoclonal antibodies, which in the opinion of the investigator may pose an increased risk of serious infusion reaction.\n4. Received active treatment on another investigational trial within 30 days (or 5 half-lives of that agent, whichever is greater) prior to Screening visit or plans to participate in another investigational drug trial.\n5. Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception during dosing and for 15 weeks after stopping treatment.\n6. Concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions which, in the opinion of the Investigator, could cause unacceptable safety risks or compromise participation in the study.\n7. History or current diagnosis of ECG abnormalities indicating significant risk of safety such as:\n\n   * Concomitant clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias (e.g ventricular tachycardia), and clinically significant second or third degree AV block without a pacemaker\n   * History of familial long QT syndrome or know family history of Torsades de Pointes\n8. Not able to understand and to comply with study instructions and requirements.\n9. Received prior treatment with crizanlizumab or other selectin targeting agent",
