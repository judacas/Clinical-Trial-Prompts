The IMiD and anti-CD38 mAb do not need to be from the same regimen in the prior line(s) of therapy.\n* Documented evidence of progressive disease by IMWG criteria based on the investigator's determination on or within 12 months of the last dose of the last regimen\n* Measurable disease at screening per IMWG, defined as any of the following:\n\n  * Serum M-protein level ≥ 0.5 g/dL or urine M-protein level ≥ 200 mg/24 hours; or\n  * Light chain MM without measurable disease in the serum or urine: serum free light chain ≥ 10 mg/dL and abnormal serum free light chain ratio\n* Only individuals who are candidates to receive at least 1 of the 4 SOCT regimens (PVd, DPd, KDd, or Kd), as determined by the investigator, should be considered for this study\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1\n* Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL (females who have undergone surgical sterilization or who have been postmenopausal for at least 2 years are not considered to be of childbearing potential)\n\nKey\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Prior B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-targeted therapy\n* Prior T-cell engager therapy\n* Prior CAR therapy or other genetically modified T-cell therapy\n* Active or prior history of central nervous system (CNS) or meningeal involvement of MM\n* Cardiac atrial or cardiac ventricular MM involvement\n* History of or active plasma cell leukemia, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, POEMS syndrome (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal protein, and skin changes), or amyloidosis\n* Active malignancy (other than MM) requiring ongoing treatment for disease control within the last 24 months. Myelodysplastic syndrome (even without ongoing treatment) is not permitted.\n* Prior auto-SCT within 12 weeks before randomization\n* Prior allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT)\n* High-dose (eg, cumulative > 70 mg prednisone or equivalent) systemic steroid therapy or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 14 days before randomization\n* Live vaccine ≤ 4 weeks before randomization\n* Contraindication to fludarabine or cyclophosphamide\n* History of allergy or hypersensitivity to any study agent or study drug components. Individuals with a history of severe hypersensitivity reaction to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) are excluded.\n* Life expectancy < 12 weeks\n\nNote: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.",
