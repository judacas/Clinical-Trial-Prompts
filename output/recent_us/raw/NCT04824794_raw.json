    "official_title": "A Pilot Study of Romosozumab Efficacy and Safety for the Management of Myelomarelated OsteoLytic Disease in Postmenopausal Women With Multiple Myeloma and Osteoporosis (REMOLD-MM)",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Documented MM per International Myeloma Working Group diagnostic criteria (evidence of myeloma defining event attributed to underlying plasma cell disorder): i. Clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow ≥ 10% or presence of a biopsy proven plasmacytoma; and ii. Any one or more of the following myeloma defining events:\n* Evidence of end organ damage that can be attributed to the underlying plasma cell proliferative disorder:\n\n  1. Hypercalcemia: serum calcium >0.25 mmol/L (>1 mg/dL) higher than the upper limit of normal or >2.75 mmol/L (>11 mg/dL)\n  2. Renal insufficiency: creatinine clearance < 40 mL/min or serum creatinine 177µmol/L (>2 mg/dL)\n  3. Anemia: hemoglobin > 2 g/dL below the lower limit of normal, or a hemoglobin value <10 g/dL\n  4. Bone lesions: one or more osteolytic lesions on skeletal radiography, CT, or PET/CT\n* Clonal bone marrow plasma cell percentage ≥ 60%; or\n* Involved: uninvolved serum free light chain (FLC) ratio ≥ 100 (involved FLC level be ≥ 10 mg/dL; or\n* >1 focal lesion on MRI studies (at least 5 mm in size)\n* Presence of lytic bone lesion(s) due to MM based on radiographic evidence with at least one measurable lesion (≥0.5 cm in its largest diameter by computerized tomography [CT])\n* Postmenopausal female, defined as last menstrual cycle at least 12 months prior to study enrollment\n* Must have one of the following:\n\n  * osteoporosis on dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan; or\n  * fragility fracture of the spine or hip; or\n  * morphometric spine fracture; or\n  * osteopenia with elevated risk of fracture (calculated by the FRAX online calculator)\n* Within 12 months prior to study entry, ≤ 4 doses of prior intravenous (IV) bisphosphonate with the last dose ≥ 3 months prior to study entry.\n* Prior oral bisphosphonates are allowed if the last dose was ≥ 3 months prior to study entry.\n* Prior denosumab use is allowed for the following:\n\n  * For patients who received ≤ 5 consecutive doses of denosumab with the last dose of denosumab received ≥ 3 months prior to study entry.\n  * For patients who received ≥ 6 doses of denosumab, IV bisphosphonate should be given at least 1 month after the last dose of denosumab (if the last dose of denosumab was within the past 2 years). Patients are then eligible ≥ 3 months after IV bisphosphonate is received. If ≤ 2 years have elapsed since the last dose of denosumab, IV bisphosphonate is not required, and patients are eligible for the study.\n* Signed informed consent form(s). Individuals with impaired decision-making capacity may enroll if legally authorized representatives consent on behalf of individuals with impaired decision-making capacity.\n* Ability to comply with all study-related procedures in the investigator's judgment\n* 18 years of age or older\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Assigned male at birth\n* Received teriparatide or other PTH analog use within 12 months prior to study entry\n* Receiving concurrent antiresorptive therapy\n* History of cardiovascular event (myocardial infarction and/or stroke) within the past 12 months of study entry\n* History of non-healed dental or oral surgery\n* History of osteonecrosis of the jaw\n* 25 (OH) vitamin D levels < 20 ng/mL. Vitamin D repletion will be permitted and subjects may be rescreened once 25 (OH) vitamin D level ≥ 20 ng/mL.\n* Current hyper- or hypocalcemia, defined as albumin-adjusted serum calcium outside the normal range per institutional standard (<8.5 or >10.5 mg/dL).",
