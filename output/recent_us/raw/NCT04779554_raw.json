    "official_title": "Effect of mTOR Inhibition and Other Metabolism Modulating Interventions on the Elderly: Immune, Cognitive, and Functional Consequences ((Substudy E - RAPA cMRI With LGE)",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* 70-95 years of age.\n* Subjects will be in good general health with all chronic diseases (hypertension, coronary artery disease, etc.) clinically stable. Selected subjects will be in good health (Per the World Health Organization good health will be defined as complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.\n* For our purposes all diseases or infirmities will be clinically stable whether managed by medications or not.\n* All ethnicities will be included.\n* For cardiac and brain imaging by MRI, a pre-MRI screening questionnaire will be used to assess MRI safety and neurological health.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be MALE\nMust have minimum age of 70 Years\nMust have maximum age of 95 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Diabetes, (with A1c â‰¥6.5 or if treated with medication affecting glucose homeostasis History of skin ulcers or poor wound healing,\n* Smoking,\n* Liver disease,\n* Coumadin anti-coagulation,\n* Treatment with drugs known to affect cytochrome P450 3A (diltiazem, erythromycin, etc) due to its role in RAPA metabolism,\n* Treatment (>30days of therapy or long term) with a systemic immunosuppressant (prednisone, etc.) within the last year,\n* History of recent (within 6 months) Myocardial Infarction or active Coronary Disease,\n* Patients with history of recent (within 6 months) intestinal disorders,\n* Exclusion criteria for MRI scan: known claustrophobia, metal implants in soft tissue of the body including pacemakers, aneurysm clips, ferrous metal fragments not anchored to bone (bullets, BBs, shrapnel, metal shavings), implanted medication pumps, and oral-facial metal appliances that are permanently secured but may result in low image quality. Participants may also be excluded for history of severe head trauma, brain injury, brain surgery, inflammation of the brain, or history of seizures.\n* Female (Studies with mTOR antagonists show that there are often substantial differences in responses by sex, sometimes favoring females, other times males. Our initial pilot study was done in males for this reason and shows trends toward improved cardiac parameters. We will study males in Substudy E, an extension of our prior trial, to generate statistically significant results while obviating potential confounding by differing pharmacodynamics sex effects. Statistically significant results will be used to support larger trials in both sexes.)\n* Positive COVID19 test.",
