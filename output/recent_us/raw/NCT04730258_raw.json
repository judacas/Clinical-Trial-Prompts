    "official_title": "An Open Label Phase I Study of Ziftomenib As Maintenance Therapy Following Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* 18 years or older.\n* Pathologically confirmed diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML).\n* Complete remission (CR) or complete remission with incomplete count recovery (CRi) at screening.\n\n  * Complete remission (CR):\n\n    * no circulating blasts in peripheral blood and <5% blasts in bone marrow\n    * no extramedullary disease\n    * platelet count ≥100 x 10(9)/L and/or absolute neutrophil count ≥1000/µL\n  * Complete remission with incomplete count recovery (CRi):\n\n    * no circulating blasts in peripheral blood and <5% blasts in bone marrow\n    * no extramedullary disease\n    * platelet count <100 x 10(9)/L and/or absolute neutrophil count <1000/µL\n* Presence of at least one of the following molecular mutations:\n\n  * KMT2A rearrangement\n\n    * Eligibility and enrollment will be based on local mutational testing.\n    * The presence of a KMT2A rearrangement (excluding partial tandem duplication [PTD]) at the time of initial diagnosis or any other time thereafter is sufficient.\n    * Participants may receive additional treatment for AML between consent and transplant.\n  * NPM1 mutation\n\n    * Eligibility and enrollment will be based on local mutational testing.\n    * For participants being transplanted in CR1, the presence of a NPM1 mutation at screening is necessary for the purposes of eligibility.\n    * For participants being transplanted in greater than or equal to CR2, the presence of a NPM1 mutation at the time of consent is not necessary for eligibility and its presence at the time of initial diagnosis or any other time thereafter is sufficient.\n    * Participants may receive additional treatment for AML between consent and transplant.\n* Treatment with a menin inhibitor prior to transplant is permitted. However, patients who experienced AML relapse or progression while being treated with a menin inhibitor prior to transplant are ineligible.\n* Will undergo first allogeneic HCT for their malignancy.\n* Transplantation will be performed with the use of conventional myeloablative (MAC) or reduced intensity conditioning (RIC).\n* HCT Donor will be one of the following:\n\n  * 5/6 or 6/6 (HLA-A, B, DR) matched related donor\n  * 7/8 or 8/8 (HLA-A, B, DR, C) matched unrelated donor. Matching in the unrelated setting must be at the allele level.\n  * Haploidentical related donor, defined as ≥ 3/6 (HLA-A, B, DR) matched\n  * ≥ 4/6 (HLA-A, B, DR) umbilical cord blood (UCB). Matching in the UCB setting is at the antigen level. Recipients may receive either one or two UCB units. In the case of 2 UCB units, both units must have been at least 4/6 matched with the recipient.\n* Any non-investigational GVHD prophylaxis regimen is allowed.\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2.\n* Participants must have normal organ and function as defined below:\n\n  * AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT) and Alkaline phosphatase < 3x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)\n  * Total bilirubin < 1.5 x institutional ULN (with the exception of subjects with a history of Gilbert's syndrome, for which the total bilirubin must be < 5 x ULN)\n  * Calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 30 mL/min (Cockcroft-Gault formula)\n* LVEF must be ≥50%, as measured by MUGA scan or echocardiogram.\n* Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test, as measured by serum or urine testing.\n* The effects of ziftomenib on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) during the entire study treatment period and through 6 months after the last dose of treatment.\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* History of other malignancy(ies) unless\n\n  * the participant has been disease-free for at least 2 years and is deemed by the investigator to be at low risk of recurrence of that malignancy, or\n  * the cancer has been deemed indolent with no progression over the last 2 years, and deemed by the investigator to be at low risk for further progression during the course of study and follow-up\n  * the only prior malignancy was cervical cancer in situ and/or basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin\n* Known diagnosis of active hepatitis B or hepatitis C\n* Current or history of congestive heart failure New York Heart Association (NHYA) class 3 or 4, or any history of documented diastolic or systolic dysfunction (LVEF < 50%, as measured by multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan or echocardiogram)\n* Current or history of ventricular or life-threatening arrhythmias or diagnosis of long-QT syndrome\n* Systemic uncontrolled infection\n* Known dysphagia, short-gut syndrome, gastroparesis, or other condition(s) that limits the ingestion or gastrointestinal absorption of drugs administered orally\n* Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure [BP] > 180 mmHg or diastolic BP > 100 mmHg)\n* QTc interval (i.e., Friderica's correction [QTcF]) ≥ 480 ms or other factors that increase the risk of QT prolongation or arrhythmic events (e.g., heart failure, hypokalemia, family history of long QT interval syndrome) at screening\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* Persons who are pregnant or lactating.",
