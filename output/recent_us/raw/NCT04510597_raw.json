    "inclusion_criteria": "* Men and women, age â‰¥18 years.\n* Evidence of IPMN as confirmed by MRI/Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) or pathology with biomarker results from Endoscopic Ultrasound-Guided Fine Needle Aspiration (EUS/FNA).\n* IPMN must be suitable for active surveillance as defined by the international Kyoto guidelines and the European guidelines. Patients eligible for our study will have IPMN with no \"high-risk stigmata\" and no \"worrisome features\" and also have a neoplasm size of 1-<3 cm.\n* Able to complete all of the periodic activities of active surveillance as defined by the international Kyoto guidelines (2024) (Appendix VII) and the European guidelines (clinic visit evaluation, blood work, MRI/MRCP, and EUS).\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group = 0-2.\n* Participants must have adequate organ and marrow function.\n* Participants with known history or current symptoms of cardiac disease, or history of treatment with cardiotoxic agents, should undergo a clinical risk assessment of cardiac function using the New York Heart Association Functional Classification (see Appendix VI). To be eligible for this trial, participants should be class I-II.\n* Agrees to avoid dietary sources of increased DT3 and abstain from consuming non-study DT3 supplements, any other dietary supplements, herbal remedies and over the counter (OTC) medicines (except use of aspirin for which data will be collected in Oncore) beginning 3 days prior to start of study drug and throughout duration of the study. DT3 levels are extremely low in normal foods. Therefore, no specific foods need to be avoided. All supportive care medications, e.g., antiemetics, antidiarrheals growth factors etc. may be used at the discretion of the treating physician and according to institutional guidelines.\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n* Participants must agree to refrain from getting pregnant, breastfeeding or fathering a child for the duration of the study.

    "exclusion_criteria": "* Evidence of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAO or other cancers (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) or metastatic disease.\n* Concurrent systemic chemotherapy for any other cancer.\n* Use of increased dietary sources of DT3, non-study DT3 supplements, any other dietary supplements, herbal remedies and OTC medicines (except use of aspirin for which data will be collected in Oncore) which may affect the study outcome unless the participant is willing to discontinue taking them 3 days prior to start of study drug DT3 and for the duration of the study.
