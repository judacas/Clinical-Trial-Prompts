    "exclusion_criteria": "* Patients who have had chemotherapy, radiotherapy, monoclonal antibody (mAb), or targeted small molecule therapy within 4 weeks of study registration are not eligible; those who have not recovered from adverse events (grade 1 or baseline) due to such agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier are not eligible\n* Patients may not be currently receiving any other investigational agents within 4 weeks of study registration\n* Patients must not have had prior exposure to any immune checkpoint inhibitors including anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1 agents, anti-PD-L2 agents, or anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibodies\n* Patients must not have known central nervous system (CNS) involvement\n* Patients must not have had prior stem cell transplantation (autologous or allogeneic)\n* Patients must not have persistent diarrhea greater than National Cancer Institute (NCI) CTCAE grade 2 at the time of study registration, despite medical management\n* Patients must not have a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids, evidence of interstitial lung disease or active, noninfectious pneumonitis\n* Patients with known immunodeficiency, known autoimmune disease, or concurrent use of immunomodulatory agents including systemic steroids within 7 days prior to registration, are ineligible\n* Patients must not have co-morbid systemic illnesses or other severe concurrent disease which, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study or interfere significantly with the proper assessment of safety and toxicity of the prescribed regimens; this includes, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements\n* Patients must not have a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment; exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical cancer\n* Patients with known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or active TB (Bacillus tuberculosis) are not eligible\n* Patients with known active hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are not eligible\n* Patients must not have a hypersensitivity to pembrolizumab or any of its excipients\n* Patients must not have received a live vaccine within 30 days of registration Note: Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist) are live attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed)\n* Patients must not be pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment\n* Patients who are unwilling or unable to comply with the protocol or have known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial are not eligible",
