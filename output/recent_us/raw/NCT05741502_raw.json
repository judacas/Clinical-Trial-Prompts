Women of childbearing potential must confirm a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 3 days prior to the initiation of study treatment; Fertile patients and their partners must agree to use effective contraceptives for the duration of study drug use and for 90 days after the last administration of study treatment\n9. Recovery to Grade 0-1 from adverse events (AEs) related to prior anticancer therapy except alopecia, < Grade 2 sensory neuropathy, and endocrinopathies controlled with hormone replacement therapy\n10. The subject is able to understand and willing to sign the ICF; willing and able to comply with all study procedures.\n\nExclusion Criteria\n\nPatients are excluded from the study if any of the following criteria apply:\n\n1. Concurrent malignancy < 5 years prior to entry other than adequately treated cervical carcinoma-in-situ, localized squamous cell cancer of the skin, basal cell carcinoma, localized prostate cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast, or < T1 urothelial carcinoma. Patients with prostate cancer that is under active surveillance are eligible.\n2. Phase I: Patients may have received single agent treatments targeting the TIGIT pathway.\n\n   Phase II: Have received previous simultaneous therapy with a PD-1 pathway inhibitor and a TIGIT inhibitor; previous monotherapy with TIGIT/PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor is allowed.\n3. Have received antibiotics lasting over 1 week within 28 days prior to first dose;\n4. Have clinically active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Patients with previously-treated brain or meningeal metastases may participate and be eligible for treatment provided they are stable and asymptomatic. Patients with asymptomatic brain metastasis or subjects who are symptomatically stable after treatment and are on < 10 mg/d prednisone or equivalent are eligible.\n5. Have history of interstitial lung disease or non-infectious pneumonitis (except from radiotherapy);\n6. Active autoimmune disease or history of autoimmune disease requiring systemic therapy < 2 years prior to screening except hypothyroidism, vitiligo, Grave's disease, Hashimoto's disease, or Type I diabetes. Patients with childhood asthma or atopy that has not been active in the 2 years prior to study screening are eligible.\n7. History of Grade 3-4 immune-related adverse events (irAEs) or irAEs requiring discontinuation of prior therapies, (except for grade 3 endocrinopathy that is managed with hormone replacement therapy).\n8. Use of systemic corticosteroids in a dose equivalent to >10 mg/day of prednisone or other immunosuppressive agent < 2 weeks prior to screening; the use of topical, intraocular, intraarticular, intranasal, or inhaled corticosteroids and systemic steroids to prevent (e.g., allergy to contrast agents) or treat non-autoimmune condition (e.g., delayed hypersensitivity caused by exposure to allergens) or short course (< 5 days) will be allowed\n9.
