    "miscellaneous_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria (ALL Patients) :\n\n* Prior Therapy: Patients must have fully recovered from the acute toxic effects of all previous chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or radiotherapy prior to study enrollment. Patients must not have received the therapies indicated below for the specified time period prior to the first day of administration of protocol therapy on this study:\n\n  * Myelosuppressive chemotherapy: Last dose was given at least 21 days before the start date for protocol therapy.\n  * Biologic (anti-neoplastic agent including retinoids): Last dose given at least 7 days prior to the start date for protocol therapy.\n  * Monoclonal antibodies: Last dose of any monoclonal antibodies must have received at least 7 days or 3 half-lives, whichever is longer, prior to the start date for protocol therapy.\n  * Other immunotherapy (ex: tumor vaccine): Patient is eligible after 42 days of completion. Steroids are excluded from inclusion in immunotherapy.\n  * Radiation Therapy: Patients must not have received radiation for a minimum of two weeks prior to first dose of the drug for small port. If extensive bone marrow radiation, at least 42 days must have elapsed.\n  * Palliative radiotherapy on study is permitted for the treatment of painful bony lesions providing the lesions were known at the time of study entry and the Investigator clearly indicates that the need for palliative radiotherapy is not indicative of disease progression. In view of the current lack of data about the interaction of repotrectinib with radiotherapy, repotrectinib treatment should be interrupted during palliative radiotherapy, stopping 1 day before palliative radiotherapy and resuming treatment 1 day after completion of palliative radiotherapy and recovery from any acute radiation toxicities to baseline.\n  * Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT): Patients are eligible 12 weeks after date of autologous hematopoietic stem cell infusion following myeloablative therapy (timed from first day of this protocol therapy). Patients who have received an autologous hematopoietic stem cell infusion to support non- myeloablative therapy (such as ^131 I-MIBG) are eligible at any time as long as they meet the other criteria for eligibility.\n  * ^131 I-MIBG therapy: A minimum of 6 weeks must have elapsed after ^131 I-MIBG therapy prior to start of protocol therapy.\n  * Growth factors: Patients are eligible 14 days after last dose of long-acting growth factor (ex: peg-GCSF) or 7 days after short acting growth factor.\n  * Any investigational agent or anticancer therapy other than chemotherapy and not otherwise noted: Not within 2 weeks prior to planned start of TPX-0005 (Repotrectinib) or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter. Full recovery of clinically significant toxicities from that therapy must be evident.\n  * Any prior treatment with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) of ALK/ROS/NTRK does NOT exclude patient from study (Patients are eligible for study at least 7 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter, after last dose)\n* Disease Status\n\n  * Patients must have relapsed or refractory disease despite standard therapy.\n  * Phase 1: Patients must have evaluable or measurable disease\n  * Phase 2: All patients must have measurable disease (per Appendices 1-3) at time of enrollment\n  * Exception: Neuroblastoma patients are permitted to have evaluable disease only (ex: bone disease only, evaluable by MIBG or FDG PET/CT)\n  * Exception: Patients with DIPG must have recurrent and/or progressive disease after upfront radiation therapy.

Females of childbearing potential must agree to avoid pregnancy during the study and agree to the use of 2 effective contraceptive methods (hormonal and barrier method of birth control) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and in the following 1 month after discontinuation of study treatment.

Patients with ALK, ROS1, or NTRK1/2/3 fusions are permitted to enroll in this cohort if progressed on prior targeted therapy or are not eligible for a higher priority study of single agent inhibition (ex: repotrectinib monotherapy IRB#20-077). Patients with tumors not characterized by any ALK/ROS/NTRK aberration are also permitted to enroll in this cohort.\n  * Phase 2\n* Cohort 1: Patients with relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma with documented ALK activating SNV (including F1174, F1245, R1275, and other SNVs deemed activating by the primary investigator).\n* Cohort 2: Patients with molecularly defined desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT)\n* Cohort 3: Exploratory cohort of patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors (no requirement of ALK, ROS1, NTRK1-3 aberrations). Patients with ALK, ROS1, or NTRK1/2/3 fusions are permitted to enroll in this cohort if progressed on prior targeted therapy or are not eligible for a higher priority study of single agent inhibition (ex: repotrectinib monotherapy IRB# 20-077).\n* Cohort 4: Patients with recurrent or progressive DIPG. Patients with typical DIPG, defined as tumors with a pontine epicenter and diffuse involvement of at least 2/3 of the pons on at least 1 axial T2-weighted image, are eligible. No histologic confirmation is required. Patients with pontine tumors that do not meet radiographic criteria for typical DIPG (e.g., focal tumors or those involving less than 2/3 of the pontine cross sectional area with or without extrapontine extension) are eligible if the tumors are biopsied and proven to be high-grade gliomas (such as anaplastic astrocytoma, glioblastoma, high-grade glioma NOS, and/or H3 K27M-mutant by immunohistochemistry or next generation sequencing CLIA certified) by institutional diagnosis.\n* Patients treated in Phase 1 at RP2D will be evaluable in the Phase 2 cohort if they meet all other inclusion criteria for the specified cohort. Patients receiving oral capsule OR oral suspension can be included in Phase 2 cohort. Enrollment of patients of at least 12 years old can begin treatment in Phase 2 once TPX-0005 (Repotrectinib) combination therapy RP2D is defined in Phase 1A (even if Phase 1B is not yet completed) Exception: DIPG patients may be enrolled on phase 2 cohort 4 prior to the completion of Phase 1 since they will receive TPX-0005 (Repotrectinib) monotherapy at the pediatric RP2D.\n* Tissue Analysis\n\n  * Phase 1: All patients must have archived tissue available for analysis (exception: DIPG patients), but ALK/ROS/NTRK status verification is not required prior to enrollment.
