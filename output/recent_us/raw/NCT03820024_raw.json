Tests performed by certified/authorized testing laboratory using licensed/approved tests and performed on blood samples collected within 30 days prior to muscle tissue procurement.\n3. Cannot, or is not willing to, maintain the current treatment regimen for existing conservative therapy (e.g., swallowing therapy).\n4. Requires prophylactic antibiotics for chronic infections, or has required 2 or more courses of antibiotics for infections in the 2 months prior to signing consent.\n5.
