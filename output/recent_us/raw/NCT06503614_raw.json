    "official_title": "A First-In-Human, Open-Label, Multicenter Study of VOR33 in Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia Who Are At High-Risk for Leukemia Relapse Following Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation",
    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Must be ≥18 and ≤70 years of age.\n2. Patients with AML must have one of the following groups of features that are known to be a risk factor for leukemia relapse:\n\n   * BM in morphological remission (<5% blasts) with adverse-risk disease related genetics at presentation (according to European Leukemia-Net guidelines [ELN, Döhner 2017]), or\n   * Intermediate risk genetics in morphologic remission (<5% blasts) with other recognized high risk criteria such as MRD+ following therapy, or\n   * BM with evidence of persistent leukemia 5-10% blasts post induction/salvage therapy. Patients with BM Blast count >10% may participate with Sponsor Medical Monitor approval. (Note: these patients may have disease-related genetics of any risk criteria at presentation), or\n   * Any patient in second or greater remission.\n3. Patients with MDS must have all of the following:\n\n   * Previous or current IPSS-R score of High or Very High risk; AND\n   * Previous or current MDS-IB1 or MDS-IB2 per the 2022 WHO criteria (Khoury 2022)\n4. AML sample from the patient must have evidence of CD33 expression (>0%)\n5. Candidate for HLA-matched allogeneic HCT using a myeloablative conditioning regimen.\n6. Must have a related or unrelated stem cell donor that is a 8/8 match for HLA-A, -B, -C, and -DRB1.\n7. Must have adequate performance status and organ function as defined below:\n\n   1. Performance Status: Karnofsky score of ≥70.\n   2. Cardiac: left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥50%\n   3. Pulmonary: diffusing capacity of lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO), forced vital capacity (FVC), and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) ≥66%.\n   4. Renal: estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) >60 mL/min\n   5. Hepatic: total bilirubin <1.5 × ULN, or if ≥1.5 × ULN direct bilirubin <ULN and ALT/AST <1.5 × ULN (per institutional criteria).\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 70 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Prior autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation.\n2. Presence of the following disease-related genetics: t(15; 17)(q22; q21), or t(9; 22)(q34; q11), or other evidence of acute promyelocytic leukemia or chronic myeloid leukemia.\n3. Prior treatment with Mylotarg™ (gemtuzumab ozogamicin) in the past 3.5 months.\n4. Active central nervous system (CNS) leukemia.\n5. Patients diagnosed with Gilbert's syndrome.\n6. Uncontrolled bacterial, viral, or fungal infections; or known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Hepatitis B, or Hepatitis C infection.",
