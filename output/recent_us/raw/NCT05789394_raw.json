    "inclusion_criteria": "* Males or females age > or = 18 years at the time of informed consent. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of atezolizumab in combination with eribulin in patients < 18 years of age, children are excluded from this study\n* Histologically- or cytologically-confirmed diagnosis of locally advanced/unresectable (inoperable or not amenable to surgical treatment) and/or metastatic transitional cell urothelial cancer of the renal pelvis, ureter, urinary bladder, or urethra\n* Presence of measurable disease meeting the following criteria:\n\n  * At least one lesion of >= 1.0 cm in long axis diameter for non-lymph nodes or >= 1.5 cm in short axis diameter for lymph nodes that is serially measurable according to RECIST 1.1 using either computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging or panoramic and close-up color photography with caliper measurement;
