In addition men should not donate sperm during this period.

Subjects with irreversible toxicity that is not reasonably expected to be exacerbated by the investigational product may be included (e.g., hearing loss, peripherally neuropathy)\n* History or current diagnosis of MDS/AML\n* Active uncontrolled infection (patients completing a course of antibiotic or antiviral therapy whose infection is deemed to be controlled may be allowed on study after discussion with the PI; the PI will serve as the final arbiter regarding eligibility)\n* Active or symptomatic viral hepatitis or chronic liver disease\n* A history of pneumonitis or extensive bilateral lung disease of non-malignant etiology\n* A malignancy (other than the one treated in this study) which has a >= 30% probability of recurrence within 24 months (except for adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer, curatively treated in-situ cancer of the cervix or Ta urothelial carcinomas)\n* Any underlying medical or psychiatric condition, which in the opinion of the investigator, will make the administration of study drug hazardous or obscure the interpretation of adverse events. Examples include, but are not limited to, uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia, recent (within 3 months) myocardial infarction, superior vena cava syndrome, extensive bilateral lung disease on high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan, uncontrolled seizures, history of allogeneic organ transplant, history of primary immunodeficiency or any psychiatric disorder that prohibits obtaining informed consent\n* Patients unable to swallow orally administered medication and patients with gastrointestinal disorders likely to interfere with absorption of the study medication\n* Patients with symptomatic uncontrolled brain metastases or spinal cord compressions. A scan to confirm the absence of brain metastases is not required.
