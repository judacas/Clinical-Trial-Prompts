Participants with documented history of benign ethnic neutropenia or other conditions could be considered with a lower ANC after discussion with and approval from the Lilly clinical research physician or scientist.\n  * Platelets: ≥75,000/cubic millimeters. Platelet transfusion permitted up to 72 hours prior.\n  * Hemoglobin: ≥8 grams per deciliter (g/dL) (≥80 g/liter). Transfusions to increase the participant's hemoglobin level to at least 8 g/dL are permitted; however, study treatment must not begin until 7 days after the transfusion, and complete blood count criteria for eligibility are confirmed within 24 hr of first study dose.\n* Adequate renal function, as defined as:\n\n  * Creatinine clearance or radioscope glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ≥60 milliliters/minute/meters squared OR serum creatinine meeting the following parameters:\n\n    * for participants ≥18 years of age serum creatinine ≤1.5×upper limit of normal (ULN);\n    * for participants <18 years of age, serum creatinine based on age/gender as follows: Age 1 to <2 years maximum serum creatinine 0.6, Age 2 to <6 years maximum serum creatinine 0.8, Age 6 to <10 years maximum serum creatinine 1.0, Age 10 to <13 years maximum serum creatinine 1.2, Age 13 to <16 years maximum serum creatinine 1.5 for males and 1.4 for females, Age 16 to <18 years maximum serum creatinine 1.7 for males and 1.4 for females.\n  * Urine protein meeting the following parameters:\n\n    * for participants ≥18 years of age: <2+ on dipstick or routine urinalysis. If urine dipstick or routine analysis indicates proteinuria ≥2+, then a 24-hour urine must be collected and must demonstrate <2 grams of protein in 24 hours to allow participation in the study.\n    * for participants <18 years of age: ≤30 milligrams per deciliter urine analysis or <2+ on dipstick. If urine dipstick or routine analysis indicates proteinuria ≥2+, then a 24-hour urine must be collected and must demonstrate <1 g of protein in 24 hours to allow participation in the study.\n* Adequate liver function:\n\n  * Total bilirubin: ≤1.5×ULN. Except participants with document history of Gilbert Syndrome who must have a total bilirubin level of <3.0×ULN.\n  * Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST): ≤2.5×ULN OR ≤5.0×ULN if the liver has tumor involvement.\n* The participant has an adequate coagulation function as defined by International Normalized Ratio ≤1.5 or prothrombin time ≤1.5×ULN, and partial thromboplastin time ≤1.5×ULN if not receiving anticoagulation therapy. For participants receiving anticoagulants, exceptions to these coagulation parameters are allowed if they are within the intended or expected range for their therapeutic use. Participants must have no history of clinically significant active bleeding (defined as within 14 days of first dose of study drug) or pathological condition that carries a high risk of bleeding (for example, tumor involving major vessels or known esophageal varices).\n* The participant has adequate hematologic and organ function ≤1 week (7 days) prior to first dose of study drug.\n* Female participants of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to randomization. Male and female participants must agree to use highly effective contraception for the duration of the study and up to 3 months following the last dose of ramucirumab and vinorelbine, and 12 months following the last dose of cyclophosphamide in order to prevent pregnancy.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 12 Months\nMust have maximum age of 29 Years",
