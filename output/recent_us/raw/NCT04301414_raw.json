    "inclusion_criteria": "1. All patients must have unresectable stage IIIb-IIId or IV melanoma by AJCC 8th edition. Note: Patients with uveal melanoma are excluded from this study.\n2. Age > 18 and ECOG Performance Status of 0 or 1.\n3. Measurable disease by RECIST 1.1\n4. Baseline tumor specimen available.\n5. Recovery to baseline or ≤ Grade 1 CTCAE v4 from toxicities related to any prior treatments, unless AE(s) are clinically nonsignificant and/or stable on supportive therapy.\n6. Adequate organ and marrow function.\n7. Capable of understanding and complying with the protocol requirements and must have signed the informed consent document.\n8. Sexually active fertile subjects and their partners must agree to use medically accepted methods of contraception (eg, barrier methods, including male condom, female condom, or diaphragm with spermicidal gel) during the course of the study and for 4 months after the last dose of study treatment.\n9. Female subjects of childbearing potential must not be pregnant at screening.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Prior treatment with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy, anti-CTLA-4 therapy or cabozantinib. Prior adjuvant anti-PD-1 and/or anti-CTLA-4 therapy is allowed if relapse is greater than 6 months from last dose.\n2. Receipt of any type of small molecule kinase inhibitor (including investigational kinase inhibitor) within 2 weeks before first dose of study treatment.\n3. Receipt of any type of cytotoxic, biologic or other systemic anticancer therapy (including investigational) within 4 weeks before first dose of study treatment.\n4. Radiation therapy for bone metastasis or brain metastasis within 2 weeks, any other radiation therapy within 4 weeks before first dose of study treatment. Systemic treatment with radionuclides within 6 weeks before the first dose of study treatment.\n5. Known brain metastases that are >10mm or cranial epidural disease unless adequately treated with radiosurgery and/or surgery (including radiosurgery). Eligible subjects must be neurologically asymptomatic and without corticosteroid requirement. Dexamethasone < 2mg daily (or equivalent) will be allowed if discontinuation of corticosteroids is not feasible due to post-radiation effects and patient is asymptomatic. Patients with active, asymptomatic brain metastases that are <10mm and no corticosteroid requirement will be allowed without radiosurgery or surgery.\n6. History of active autoimmune disorder requiring immunosuppressive agents. Patients with autoimmune disorders considered low risk, such as vitiligo and thyroiditis, will be allowed.\n7. Concomitant anticoagulation with coumarin agents (e.g., warfarin), direct thrombin inhibitors (e.g. dabigatran), betrixaban, or platelet inhibitors (eg, clopidogrel).\n\n   Allowed anticoagulants are the following:\n   1. Prophylactic use of Low-dose aspirin for cardio-protection (per local applicable guidelines) and low-dose low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) are permitted.\n   2. Anticoagulation with therapeutic doses of LMWH or anticoagulation with direct factor Xa inhibitors rivaroxaban, edoxaban, or apixaban is allowed in subjects without known brain metastases who are on a stable dose of LMWH anticoagulant for at least 6 weeks 1week before first dose of study treatment, and who have had no clinically significant hemorrhagic complications from the anticoagulation regimen or the tumor.\n8. The subject has prothrombin time (PT)/INR or partial thromboplastin time (PTT) test ≥ 1.3 x the laboratory ULN within 7 days before the first dose of study treatment.\n9. The subject has uncontrolled, significant intercurrent or recent illness.\n10. Major surgery (eg, GI surgery, removal or biopsy of brain metastasis) within 8 weeks before first dose of study treatment.\n11. Corrected QT interval calculated by the Fridericia formula (QTcF) > 500 ms per electrocardiogram (ECG) within 28 days before first dose of study treatment.\n12. Pregnant or lactating females.\n13. Inability to swallow tablets.\n14. Previously identified allergy or hypersensitivity to components of the study treatment formulations.\n15. Diagnosis of another malignancy within 2 years before first dose of study treatment, except for superficial skin cancers, or localized, low grade tumors deemed cured and not treated with systemic therapy.\n16. Subjects with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (> 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study drug administration. Inhaled or topical steroids, and adrenal replacement doses > 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease.",
