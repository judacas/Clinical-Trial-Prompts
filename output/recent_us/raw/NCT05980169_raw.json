    "inclusion_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria\n\n1. Subject must be â‰¥18 years of age at the time of study enrollment\n2. Subject must have Biopsy-confirmed primary or metastatic carcinoma with involvement of the lung, liver, adrenal gland, pancreas, kidney, and/or abdominal/pelvic lymph node that would receive SABR\n3. Any lesion that would receive SABR under this study protocol is no larger than 5 cm in greatest dimension\n4. 1-10 total lesions that would receive SABR\n5. If multiple lesions are treated, they must be at least 3 cm apart\n6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2\n7. Life expectancy at least 6 months\n8. Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Abstinence is acceptable if it's the patient preferred method. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she must inform her treating physician immediately.\n9. Patients receiving hormonal therapy or immunotherapy such as immune checkpoint inhibitor that had begun at least 4 weeks prior to SABR will be allowed.\n\nExclusion criteria\n\n1. Subject has contraindication to having an MRI scan\n2. Subject has central or ultra-central lung tumor that would receive SABR on this study, defined as a lesion located within 2 cm of the trachea and proximal bronchial tree\n3. Subject has received cytotoxic chemotherapy or investigational agent within 2 weeks of SBRT\n4. Subject has uncontrolled brain metastases, spinal cord compression, or leptomeningeal carcinomatosis\n5. Subject has any unresolved toxicity (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 > grade 2) from previous anti-cancer therapy\n6. Subject has any condition in the opinion of the investigator that would interfere with evaluation of study treatment or interpretation of patient safety or study results\n7. Subject has received prior radiation therapy that directly overlaps any radiation therapy given in this study\n8. Subject has received radiation therapy that could lead to an unacceptably high risk of clinically significant normal tissue injury due to high cumulative normal tissue dose as determined by the investigator\n9. Female subject who are pregnant or breastfeeding\n10. Subject who has received vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor such as bevacizumab within 4 weeks prior to study therapy or planned to receive it within 4 weeks after study therapy.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
