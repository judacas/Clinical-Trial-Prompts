    "inclusion_criteria": "* Patients must have a minimum head circumference of 44 cm\n* Patients must have a histologically- or cytologically-confirmed supratentorial high-grade glioma or supratentorial ependemoma.\n* Patients with metastatic disease involving the infratentorium or spinal cord are eligible providing that they have a supratentorial tumor that is able to be targeted with TTFields.\n* Eligible pathologic diagnoses include:\n\nHigh-grade Glioma (WHO Grade III or IV): Anaplastic Astrocytoma, Astroblastoma, Diffuse Midline Glioma, Glioblastoma, Gliosarcoma Ependymoma (WHO Grade II or III):Ependymoma, Anaplastic Ependymoma\n\n* Patients with high-grade glioma must must have be newly-diagnosed or have a tumor that is progressive or recurrent following standard treatment. Patients with ependymoma must have a tumor that is progressive or recurrent following standard treatment.\n* Patients must have received the maximal feasible resection of their tumor and radiation therapy (unless contraindicated due to patient age) as part of their initial treatment prior to study enrollment.\n* Patients must be enrolled before treatment begins. Treatment must start within 14 days of study enrollment.\n* All clinical and laboratory studies to determine eligibility must be performed within 7 days prior to enrollment unless otherwise indicated in the eligibility section.\n* Newly-diagnosed patients must begin therapy within six weeks of the completion of radiotherapy, or within six weeks of surgical resection if radiotherapy is contraindicated.\n* Recurrent high-grade glioma patients must begin therapy within four weeks of documented tumor progression by MRI scan.\n* Patients must have a Lansky or Karnofsky performance status score of ≥ 50%, corresponding to ECOG categories of 0, 1 or 2. Use Karnofsky for patients > 16 years of age and Lansky for patients ≤ 16 years of age. Patients who are unable to walk because of paralysis, but who are up in a wheelchair will be considered ambulatory for the purpose of assessing the performance score.\n* Able to undergo adequate tumor imaging, via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan to evaluate disease evolution.\n* Adequate hematologic, renal, liver function as demonstrated by laboratory values: ANC ≥ 1,000/ul Hemoglobin ≥8.0 gm/dl Platelet count ≥ 100,000/ul\n\nAdequate Liver Function Defined As:\n\n* Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) for age, and\n* SGPT (ALT) < 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) for age. Adequate Renal Function Defined As Either\n* Creatinine clearance or radioisotope GFR ≥ 70ml/min/1.73m2\n* or a serum creatinine less than or equal to the institutional normal for age\n\n  * Negative pregnancy test in women of childbearing potential within 7 days of initiating investigational therapy\n  * Recent mothers must agree not to breast feed while receiving medications on study\n  * Patient or legal guardian must give written, informed consent or assent (when applicable).\n  * Able to swallow and ingest oral medication or have a NG or G-tube for drug administration\n  * Urine protein should be screened by urine analysis. If protein ≥ 2+ on urinalysis, then Urine Protein Creatinine (UPC) ratio should be calculated. If UPC ratio > 0.5, 24-hour urine protein should be obtained and the level should be < 1000 mg for patient enrollment.\n\nNote: UPC ratio of spot urine is an estimation of the 24 urine protein excretion - a UPC ratio of 1 is roughly equivalent to a 24-hour urine protein of 1000 mg. UPC ratio is calculated using one of the following formula:\n\n* [urine protein]/[urine creatinine] - if both protein and creatinine are reported in mg/dL\n* [(urine protein) x0.088]/[urine creatinine] - if urine creatinine is reported in mmol/L\n* Adequate Coagulation Defined As: PT/INR ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 5 Years\nMust have maximum age of 21 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Age less than 5 or greater than or equal to 18 years\n* Head circumference < 44 cm\n* Absence of supratentorial tumor\n* Use of any other investigational drug within five half-lives of that drug prior to the initiation of protocol therapy\n* Anti-cancer therapy within 4 weeks prior to the initiation of protocol therapy (6 weeks for mitomycin and nitrosureas, 4 weeks for curative-intent radiotherapy, and 2 weeks for palliative radiotherapy)\n* Any National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE version 4.0) >Grade 1 toxicities from prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy that could impact on safety outcome assessment\n* Any surgery within 14 days prior to initiation of protocol therapy (excluding shunt or line insertion)\n* Implanted pacemaker, programmable shunts, defibrillator, deep brain stimulator, other implanted electronic devices in the brain, or documented clinically significant arrhythmias.\n* Evidence of increased intracranial pressure (midline shift > 5mm, clinically significant papilledema, vomiting and nausea or reduced level of consciousness) Patients receiving escalating doses of corticosteroids to control symptoms of increased intracranial pressure (e.g., require a stable or decreasing dose of corticosteroids for at least 7 days prior to enrollment) will also be excluded.\n* Known > Grade 1 intracranial or intratumoral hemorrhage either by CT or MRI scan within the last 1 month. Patients with resolving hemorrhage changes, punctuate hemorrhage or hemosiderin may enter the study\n* Pregnant female patients, Pregnancy tests with a negative result must be obtained in all post-menarchal females.\n* Lactating females must agree they will not breastfeed a child while on this study.\n* Males and females of reproductive potential may not participate unless they agree to use an effective contraceptive method and continue to do so for at least 6 months after the completion of therapy.\n* Any serious and/or unstable pre-existing medical, psychiatric or other condition which in the Investigator's opinion could interfere with subject safety, obtaining written informed consent, or compliance with the study protocol\n* Known hypersensitivity to temozolomide or bevacizumab\n* Patients who are unable to take oral medications because of significant uncontrolled vomiting will be excluded.\n* Patients must not have a history of myocardial infarction, severe or unstable angina, clinically significant peripheral vascular disease, Grade 2 or greater heart failure, or serious and inadequately controlled cardiac arrhythmia.\n* Patients must not have a known clinically significant bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy\n* Patients who have experienced arterial thromboembolic events, including transient ischemic attacks or cerebrovascular accidents are excluded from participation.\n* Patients must not have been previously diagnosed with a deep venous thrombosis (including pulmonary embolism), and must not have a known thrombophilic condition (e.g., protein S, protein C, antithrombin III deficiency, Factor V Leiden or Factor II G202'0A mutation, homocysteinemia, or antiphospholipid antibody syndrome).\n* Patients must not have a history of an abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation, or intra-abdominal abscess within the last 6 months prior to study entry.\n* Patients with a serious or non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture are not eligible for this study.\n* Patients with a history of allergic reaction to Chinese hamster ovary cell products, or other recombinant human antibodies are ineligible.",
