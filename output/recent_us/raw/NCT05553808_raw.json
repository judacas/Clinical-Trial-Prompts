    "inclusion_criteria": "All subjects must meet the following inclusion and exclusion criteria. No exceptions will be given. Imaging studies to establish eligibility must be done within three weeks prior to enrollment. All other clinical evaluations to establish eligibility (except for SST2A IHC) must be done within 7 days prior to enrollment.\n\n1. Screening Criteria\n\n   1.1 Diagnosis Patient must have a diagnosis of primary high-grade CNS tumor (any histopathologic diagnosis that is WHO grade III-IV) or meningioma (any histologic grade) that is recurrent, progressive, or refractory. Note that patients with DIPG (based on radiographic/clinical diagnosis) who have undergone biopsy will be eligible with histologic diagnosis of grade II-IV infiltrating glioma. All tumors must have histologic verification either at the time of diagnosis or recurrence, except for patients meningioma who have not previously undergone biopsy or resection.\n\n   Note: Refractory disease is defined as the presence of persistent abnormality on conventional MRI imaging that is further distinguished by histology (biopsy or sample of lesion) or advanced imaging, OR as determined by the treating physician and discussed with the primary investigator prior to enrollment.\n\n   1.2 Prior Therapy Patients must have recurred/progressed following prior standard therapy for their tumor. Note: with meningioma, atypical meningioma, or anaplastic meningioma must have received at least surgical resection or radiation.\n\n   1.3 Screening Consent Participant/legal guardian is willing to sign a screening consent for DOTATATE PET imaging.
