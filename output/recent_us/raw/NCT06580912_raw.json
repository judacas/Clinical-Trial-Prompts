In addition, women of childbearing potential are required to undergo serum pregnancy testing at screening, and at the treatment termination visit.\n\n   Male study participants should refrain from sperm donation during study treatment and up to 3 months following the last dose of TPST-1495\n6. To have archival tumor tissue specimen available. Otherwise, patients should agree to have tumor biopsy to obtain sufficient tissue for histological assessment.\n7. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) of 0 or 1.\n8. Life expectancy estimated to be > 12 weeks.\n9. Adequate organ and marrow function as defined in protocol.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Concurrent enrollment in another clinical study, unless it is an observational clinical study, a specimen-collection study, or the follow-up period of an interventional study.\n2. Patients who used NSAID or COX-2 inhibitors with duration of 4 days or longer within 2 weeks prior to study treatment initiation.\n3. Patients with past medical history (PMH) of allergy or hypersensitivity, GI bleed, or ulceration secondary to NSAID's or COX-2 inhibitors.\n4. PMH of GI ulcer within one year of treatment initiation or history of untreated helicobacter's pylori infection.

Uncontrolled intercurrent illness, including but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrythmia, serious chronic gastrointestinal conditions associated with diarrhea, or psychiatric illness/social situations including a history of substance abuse that would limit compliance with study requirement, substantially increase risk of incurring AEs or compromise the ability of the patient to give written informed consent.\n10. Subjects who are receiving anticoagulant therapy or considered to be at increased risk of bleeding (i.e., bleeding disorder or coagulopathy).\n11. Psychological, familial, sociological, or geographical conditions that do not permit compliance with the protocol and/or follow-up procedures outlined in the protocol.\n12.
