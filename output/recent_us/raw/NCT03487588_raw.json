    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Males and females greater than or equal to 18 years of age\n2. Life expectancy of at least 3 months\n3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0, 1 or 2\n4. Histopathologically confirmed diagnosis of PCNSL (medical record is acceptable). Cerebral biopsies are not required if imaging reveals typical images of PCNSL.\n\n   1. Participants with parenchymal lesions must have unequivocal evidence of disease progression (e.g., presence of at least 1 measurable target lesion [≥ 10 millimeters (mm) and ≤ 40 mm in the longest diameter on brain magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] or head computed tomography [CT] on imaging within 28 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1]). In cases where the tumor size is smaller but still measurable and located at a critical central nervous system (CNS) location, disabling the participant and/or causing symptoms, this participant may be eligible following a discussion with the Sponsor Medical Monitor.\n   2. For participants limited to leptomeningeal involvement, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis (cytology and/or flow cytometry) with or without additional imaging (MRI) of the spine as clinically indicated is required to document abnormal cells within 28 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1.\n\nExclusion Criteria for Part B and Part C\n\n1. Participants with only intraocular PCNSL without brain lesion or CSF involvement, T-cell lymphoma, systemic presence of lymphoma, or non-CNS lymphoma metastatic to the CNS\n2. Evidence of systemic lymphoma. This must be demonstrated by a positron emission tomography (PET) scan (or CT scan with contrast if applicable) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis at Screening (testicular ultrasound may be considered to exclude a testicular lymphoma disseminated to the brain).\n3. Prior history of malignancies other than lymphoma (except for basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in situ of the cervix or breast) or prior history of systemic lymphoma, unless the participant has been free of the disease for ≥ 3 years.\n4. Active malignancy other than PCNSL requiring systemic therapy\n5. Previous BTKi treatment (Part C only).\n6. History of Grade ≥ 3 rhabdomyolysis without complete recovery\n7. Requirement for urgent therapy due to uncontrolled tumor mass/edema effects.\n8. Received external beam radiation therapy to the CNS within 28 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1.\n9. Received prior investigational drugs (including treatment in clinical research, unapproved combination products, and new dosage forms) within 28 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter, prior to Cycle 1 Day 1; allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) within 60 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1; or had clinically significant graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) requiring ongoing up-titration of immunosuppressive medications prior to Screening (with the exception of a BTKi for Part B only).\n\n   Note: The use of a stable or tapering dose of immunosuppressive therapy post-HSCT and/or topical steroids for ongoing skin GVHD is permitted with Sponsor Medical Monitor approval\n10. Any prior systemic anti-cancer treatment such as chemotherapy, immunomodulatory drug therapy, etc., received within 14 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter, prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 (with the exception of ibrutinib or other BTKi for Part B only, which may be continued until the day before Cycle 1 Day 1)\n11. Prior history of hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis to emavusertib, ibrutinib or any of their excipients.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
