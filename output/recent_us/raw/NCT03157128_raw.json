HER2-negative tumor is defined per American Society of Clinical Oncology and the College of American Pathologists guidelines, 2018.\n* Stated willingness to comply with all study procedures and availability for the duration of the study.\n* Prior use of hormone contraceptives and replacement therapy is allowed (e.g., estrogen and/or progestin) if discontinued > 6 months prior to diagnosis.
