    "exclusion_criteria": "* Diagnosis of Richter's Transformation not of DLBCL subtype (including but not limited to Hodgkin lymphoma, PLL)\n* Prior therapy targeting Richter's transformation.\n* Any subject that initiates a targeted agent such as BTKi, venetoclax, or PI3K prior to enrollment (Continuation of a targeted CLL directed therapy such as a BTKi, venetoclax, or PI3K will be permitted as a bridge through screening but add on therapies or change in therapy will be exclusionary. These continuation therapies will be permitted up 72 hours prior to study initiation. Bridging therapy with steroid up to equivalent of 40mg of Dexamethasone daily will be allowed prior to study treatment and can be continued up to 24 hours prior to study treatment)\n* Subject has undergone an allogeneic stem cell transplant for CLL within 6 months of study entry.\n* Subject has an active or presumed secondary malignancy at time of enrollment. A subject will be eligible if a previous malignancy was treated with curative intent and there is no evidence of disease recurrence for the past 3 years. Non-melanomatous and cervical squamous cell cancers are an exception and if excised will be allowed to enroll regardless of timing of excision.\n* Subject is known to be positive for HIV.\n* Active hepatitis C or hepatitis B defined by positive PCRs for viral DNA/RNA.
