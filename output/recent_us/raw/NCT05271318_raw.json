(Subjects who are prophylactically treated with an agent such as warfarin or heparin will be allowed to participate provided that no prior evidence of underlying abnormality in coagulation parameters exists. Close monitoring of at least weekly evaluations will be performed until INR/PTT is stable based on a measurement that is pre-dose as defined by the local standard of care.\n   6. Platelet count ≥100000 /mm3, hemoglobin (Hb) ≥9 g/dL, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1500/mm3. Blood transfusion to meet the inclusion criteria will not be allowed.\n9. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test performed within 7 days prior to the start of study drug. Post-menopausal women (defined as no menses for at least 1 year) and surgically sterilized women are not required to undergo a pregnancy test.

Subjects (men and women) of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception beginning at the signing of the ICF until at least 2 months after the last dose of study drug as outlined in Appendices 12.2\n11. The definition of adequate contraception will be based on the judgment of the principal investigator or a designated associate.\n12. Subject must be able to swallow and retain oral medication.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
