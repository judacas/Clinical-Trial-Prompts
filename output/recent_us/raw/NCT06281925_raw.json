    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Acute or chronic medical (including COVID-19 infection), surgical, psychiatric, or social condition or laboratory abnormality that may increase subject risk associated with study participation, compromise adherence to study procedures and requirements, or may confound interpretation of study safety or PD results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for enrollment.\n2. Body mass index < 18.5 or ≥ 35 kg/m2.\n3. History of or current immunodeficiency disorder including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody positivity.\n4. Hepatitis B surface antigen positivity (subjects with hepatitis B surface antibody positivity and hepatitis B core antibody positivity are not excluded, provided that the hepatitis B surface antigen is negative).\n5. Hepatitis C antibody positivity, unless a hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid test is performed, and the result is negative.\n6. History of febrile illness, confirmed bacteremia, or other active infection deemed clinically significant by the investigator within 30 days prior to the anticipated first dose of IMP.\n7. History of (within the past month) passage of 3 or more loose stools per day, where \"loose stool\" is defined as a Type 6 or Type 7 on the Bristol Stool Chart.\n8. Inflammatory or irritable bowel disorder of any grade experienced within the previous 60 days.\n9. Active or past history of gastrointestinal bleeding within 60 days prior to the Screening Visit as confirmed by hospitalization-related event(s) or medical history of hematemesis or hematochezia.\n10. Intolerance of or allergic reaction to EcN, esomeprazole, or any of the ingredients in SYNB1934 or placebo formulations. (For subjects who may be randomized to receive SYNB1618, intolerance of or allergic reaction to any of the ingredients in the SYNB1618 formulation.)\n11. Any condition (e.g., celiac disease, gastrectomy, bypass surgery, ileostomy), prescription medication, or over-the-counter product that may possibly affect absorption of medications or nutrients.\n12. Currently taking or plans to take any type of systemic (e.g., oral or intravenous) antibiotic within 30 days prior to Day -1 through the final day of inpatient monitoring. Exception: topical antibiotics are allowed.\n13.

Administration or ingestion of an investigational drug within 30 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer, prior to the Screening Visit, or current enrollment in an investigational study.\n18. Receipt of a COVID-19 vaccine 7 days prior to the anticipated first dose of IMP or 7 days after the last dose of IMP is permitted; otherwise, COVID-19 vaccines are not permitted during study participation.\n19. Administration or ingestion of a PPI within 30 days prior to Day -2.\n20. Screening laboratory parameters (e.g., chemistry panel, hematology, coagulation) and ECG outside of the normal limits based on standard ranges, or as judged to be clinically significant by the investigator. A single repeat evaluation is acceptable.",
