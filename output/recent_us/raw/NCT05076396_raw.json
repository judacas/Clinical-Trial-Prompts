Patients may continue to receive adjuvant therapy at the time of study enrollment (e.g., adjuvant hormonal therapy for curatively treated breast cancer).\n* Known hematologic malignancy requiring treatment in the preceding 5 years or a known history of lymphoid malignancy\n* Previous receipt of CAR T cell therapy or any other cellular therapy\n* Previous mesothelin-directed therapy Any major abdominal surgery (laparotomy with resection of gastrointestinal tract or organ resection) that is completed &lt;28 days before study enrollment. Patients who have undergone diagnostic laparoscopy can be included in the study without regard to timing\n* Untreated or active central nervous system (CNS) metastases (progressing or requiring anticonvulsants or corticosteroids for symptomatic control). Patients with a history of treated CNS metastases are eligible if all of the following criteria are met:\n\n  * Radiographic demonstration of improvement upon completion of CNS-directed therapy and no evidence of interim progression between completion of CNS-directed therapy and the screening radiographic study\n  * Completion of radiotherapy ≥4 weeks before the screening radiographic study\n* Active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment within 1 year before leukapheresis (with the use of disease-modifying agents, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive drugs)\n\n  o Note: Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency) is not considered a form of systemic treatment and is allowed.\n* Receiving daily systemic corticosteroids ≥10 mg of prednisone daily or equivalent or receiving immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory treatment\n* Any of the following cardiac conditions:\n\n  * New York Heart Association stage III or IV congestive heart failure\n  * Myocardial infarction ≤6 months before enrollment\n  * History of myocarditis\n  * Serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, unstable angina, or uncontrolled infection\n  * Left ventricular ejection fraction ≤40%\n* Active interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis or a history of interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis requiring treatment with systemic steroids\n* Baseline pulse oximetry &lt;90% on room air at the screening time point\n* Known active infection requiring antibiotic treatment 7 days before leukapheresis\n\n  o Note: Treatment can be delayed at the discretion of the treating physician to allow the patient to recover from the infection.\n* Any other medical condition, e.g. fever &gt;38.0 degrees C, that, in the opinion of the PI, may interfere with the subject's participation in or compliance with the study\n* Receipt of live, attenuated vaccine within 8 weeks before the planned lymphodepleting chemotherapy date\n* Deemed to be noncompliant by the study team for administration of a high-risk treatment agent and for close follow-up after treatment as required by the protocol\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
