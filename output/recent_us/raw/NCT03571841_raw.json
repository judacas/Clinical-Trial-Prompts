    "official_title": "An Open-label, Multicenter, Randomized Phase 2 Study of the ATR Inhibitor Tuvusertib in Combination With the PARP Inhibitor Niraparib or the ATM Inhibitor Lartesertib in Participants With BRCA Mutant and/or Homologous Recombination deﬁciency (HRD)-Positive Epithelial Ovarian Cancer That Progressed on Prior PARP Inhibitor Therapy (DDRiver EOC 302)",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Histologically or cytologically confirmed high grade serous or high grade endometrioid ovarian, primary peritoneal, and/or fallopian tube cancer that is recurrent.\n* Participants whose tumor carries germline or somatic deleterious or suspected deleterious mutations in the genes BRCA1 (Breast Cancer gene 1) and BRCA2 (Breast Cancer gene 2), and/or tumors with positive HRD status. The presence of any of these mutations and/or the homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) status will be determined according to routinely used local standard of care tests. Results must be available before screening.\n* Radiologically confirmed/documented disease progression while on Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors therapy in either first or second-line maintenance setting (only 1 line of PARPi maintenance is allowed with or without bevacizumab). Note: Documentation of disease progression must be within 28 days of last PARPi dose taken. Surgical salvage intervention and/or focal ablative therapies are allowed, (further disease progression after these interventions must be documented), AND Clinically benefited from PARPi maintenance prior to documented progression, as defined by at least 6 months of treatment duration with no progressive disease observed, AND either, Progression on first-line maintenance PARPi: Participants are allowed maximum 1 additional line of platinum-based chemotherapy before study entry. (note: treatment-free interval on platinum rechallenge must be >6 months, with documented disease progression prior to study entry).\n\nOR Progression on second-line maintenance PARPi: Participants are not allowed any additional systemic anticancer treatments before study entry (that is PARPi is the last treatment before study entry)\n\n* Measurable disease per RECIST v1.1, as assessed by Investigator.\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 and a life expectancy of at least 6 months.\n* Other Protocol defined inclusion criteria could apply.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be FEMALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Primary platinum-refractory disease defined as disease progression during primary platinum-based chemotherapy or platinum-resistant disease defined as disease progression within 6 months of the last platinum administration in the second-line setting.\n* History of additional malignancy within 3 years before the date of enrollment.\n* Known brain metastases, unless clinically stable, that is without evidence of progression by imaging for at least 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study intervention, no evidence of new brain metastases, and on a stable or decreasing dose of ≤ 10 mg of prednisone (or equivalent) or without corticosteroids for at least 14 days prior to study intervention administration.\n* Active and/or uncontrolled infection.\n* History of known hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any excipients (e.g. polysorbate 80) of the study interventions.\n* Organ transplantation, including allogenic stem cell transplant.\n* Other Protocol defined exclusion criteria could apply.",
