If a patient has PR to prior regimen without PD, there must be biopsy-proven** residual disease that is measurable\n\n    * Exception can be granted by the principal investigator (PI) if a biopsy is not feasible and/or safe\n* Patient must have measurable disease by computerized tomography (CT) or positron emission tomography (PET) scan, with one or more sites of disease >= 1.5cm in longest dimension.\n* Be willing to provide tissue from a fresh core or excisional biopsy of a tumor lesion prior to starting study therapy or from archival tissue of a biopsy that was performed after the most recent systemic therapy.

Note: If folic acid was not started but methylmalonic acid (MMA) and homocysteine (HCY) levels were checked and are in normal range at screening, the investigator can decide to start study therapy immediately. Vitamin B12 and folic acid supplementation is standard of care for pralatrexate therapy.\n* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >= 1,000/mm^3. In Phase 2 portion of study, ANC < 1000/mm^3 but >= 500/mm^3 is allowable if patients have demonstrated bone marrow involvement by lymphoma (within 14 days prior to day 1 of protocol therapy).\n\n  * Note: Growth factor is not permitted within 7 days of ANC assessment unless cytopenia is secondary to disease involvement.\n* Platelets >= 75,000/mm^3. In Phase 2 portion of study, Platelets < 75,000/mm^3 but >= 25,000/mm^3 is allowable if patients have demonstrated bone marrow involvement by lymphoma (within 14 days prior to day 1 of protocol therapy)\n\n  * Note: Platelet transfusions are not permitted within 7 days of platelet assessment unless cytopenia is secondary to disease involvement.\n* Total serum bilirubin =< 1.5 X upper limit of norma (ULN) or =< 3X ULN for Gilbert's disease. Direct bilirubin =< ULN for subjects with total bilirubin levels > 1.5 ULN (within 14 days prior to day 1 of protocol therapy).\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) =< 2.5 x ULN (within 14 days prior to day 1 of protocol therapy)\n* Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) =< 2.5 x ULN (within 14 days prior to day 1 of protocol therapy)\n* Creatinine clearance of >= 60 mL/min per the Cockcroft-Gault formula (within 14 days prior to day 1 of protocol therapy). If creatinine clearance (CrCl) is >= 60 mL/min as measured by 24 hour urine collection, this will be allowable.\n* If not receiving anticoagulants: International normalized ratio (INR) OR prothrombin (PT) =< 1.5 x ULN (within 14 days prior to day 1 of protocol therapy).\n\n  * If on anticoagulant therapy: PT must be within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants.\n* If not receiving anticoagulants: Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) =< 1.5 x ULN (within 14 days prior to day 1 of protocol therapy)\n\n  * If on anticoagulant therapy: aPTT must be within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants.\n* Female of childbearing potential: negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication (within 14 days prior to day 1 of protocol therapy). If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required.\n* Woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP): Use two effective methods of contraception (hormonal or barrier method) or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course of the study through 120 days post last dose of pembrolizumab. WOCBP defined as not being surgically sterilized or have not been free from menses for >1 year.\n\n  * Male: Use two effective methods of contraception (barrier method) or abstain from heterosexual activity with the first dose of study therapy through 120 days post last dose of pembrolizumab.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",

Subjects with prior CNS involvement by lymphoma must have a baseline magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and lumbar puncture at screening that demonstrate no active lymphoma in the CNS.\n* Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or current pneumonitis.\n* Active, uncontrolled infection requires systemic therapy.\n* Female: Pregnant or breastfeeding.\n* Expecting to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.\n* Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorder that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial.\n* History or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.\n* Any other condition that would, in the investigator's judgment, contraindicate the patient's participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns with clinical study procedures.\n* Perspective participants who, in the opinion of the investigator, may not be able to comply with all study procedures (including compliance issues related to feasibility/logistics).",
