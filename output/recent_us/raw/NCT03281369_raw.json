Patients with mild cognitive impairment may be considered for enrollment in the study if their legally authorized representative provides written informed consent for the patient.\n* 18 years or older in age\n* Biopsy proven dMMR (by IHC), Stage II or III colon cancer per CT imaging correlation with AJCC 8th edition, 2017, amendable to en block surgical resection as determined by colorectal surgeon.\n* Biopsy specimen for diagnosis of dMMR Colon cancer should have enough tissue for minimum 4 and max 6 adjacent unstained FFPE slides (4µm each) as determined by Protocol Pathologist Dr. Anthony Snow for CD3+ and CD8+ analysis. If there is not enough tissue present in original sample, a repeat colonoscopy and biopsy may be performed; otherwise patient is not eligible.\n* Potentially surgically resectable Stage II or III patients who are willing to forgo surgical resection if study endpoints are met. Patient with easily manageable bowel changes amenable to laxatives or stool softeners as outpatient per assessment by colorectal surgery are allowed.

Information must be captured appropriately within the site's source documents. Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the established and preferred contraception for the patient.\n* For males of reproductive potential: use of condoms or other methods to ensure effective contraception with partner starting with first dose of study treatment through 180 days after the last dose of study treatment. Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the established and preferred contraception for the patient.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",

Also, patients with history of HCV infection that have not completed curative antiviral treatment and the HCV viral load is not below the limit of quantification areexcluded.(e.g. a patient who is HCV Ab positive but HCV RNA negative due to prior treatment or natural resolution is eligible.)\n* Prior history of interstitial lung disease.\n* Received a live vaccine within 30 days of initiating protocol therapy.\n* Not enough tissue for confirming dMMR status and CD3+ /CD8+ testing\n* 19.
