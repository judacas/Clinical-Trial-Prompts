Subjects with esophageal cancer must have received, or been intolerant to, a platinum-based combination as part of their prior therapy for advanced/metastatic disease;\n   4. Subjects with gastric cancer must have received, or been intolerant to, a fluoropyrimidine-platinum combination as part of their prior therapy for advanced/metastatic disease;\n   5. Subjects with HCC must have received (or been intolerant to) sorafenib as part of their prior therapy for advanced metastatic disease.\n4. Measurable disease per RECIST v1.1 and irRECIST;\n5. ECOG performance status of 0 or 1;\n6. Adequate organ and marrow function;\n7. Willingness to provide consent for biopsy samples;\n8. For females of childbearing potential, use effective contraception from time of screening though 90 days post last dose of Toripalimab.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Concurrent enrollment in another clinical study, unless it is an observational (non-interventional) clinical study or the follow-up period of an interventional study;\n2. Any concurrent chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, or biologic therapy for cancer treatment. Concurrent use of hormones for non-cancer related conditions is acceptable (e.g., insulin for diabetes & hormone replacement therapy). Local treatment of isolated lesions for palliative intent is acceptable;\n3. Receipt of any investigational anti-cancer therapy within 4 weeks prior to first dose of Toripalimab;\n4. Current use or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 4 weeks prior to first dose of Toripalimab, with the exception of intranasal and inhaled corticosteroids or systemic corticosteroids not to exceed 10mg/day of prednisone or equivalent;\n5. Part A: Prior exposure to immunotherapy such as but not limited to other anti-CTLA- 4, anti-PD-1, or anti-PD-L1 antibodies excluding vaccines. Part B: Exclusion of prior immunotherapy exposure will be limited to anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2;\n6. Prior allogeneic bone marrow transplantation or prior solid organ transplantation;\n7. Major surgery within 4 weeks prior to first dose of Toripalimab or still recovering from prior surgery;\n8. Unresolved toxicities from prior anticancer therapy defined as having not resolved to baseline or to Grade 0 or 1, or to levels dictated in the inclusion/exclusion criteria with the exception of alopecia;\n9. Active or prior documented autoimmune disease within the past 2 years. Subjects with vitiligo, Grave's disease, or psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment within the past 2 years are not excluded;\n10. Known history of tuberculosis;\n11.

Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure according to NYHA Functional Classification â‰¥3, uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, active peptic ulcer disease or gastritis, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements, substantially increase risk of incurring adverse events from Toripalimab, or compromise the ability of the subject to give written informed consent;\n15. Symptomatic or untreated central nervous system metastases requiring concurrent treatment, inclusive of but not limited to surgery, radiation, and/or corticosteroids. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are clinically stable for at least 4 weeks prior to study entry, have no evidence of new or enlarging metastases, and are off steroids;\n16. Receipt of live attenuated vaccination within 30 days prior to study entry or within 4 weeks of receiving Toripalimab;\n17. Pregnancy or breastfeeding women.",
