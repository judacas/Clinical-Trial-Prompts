    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Relapsed or refractory, histologically confirmed follicular lymphoma, grade I, II, or IIIa which requires therapy defined by at least one of the following:\n\n   * Constitutional symptoms\n   * Cytopenias\n2. High tumor burden (single mass > 7 cm, three masses > 3 cm, symptomatic splenomegaly, organ compression or compromise, ascites, pleural effusion)Must have received at least two prior systemic therapies\n3. All risk by FLIPI 0-5 factors (Appendix I)\n4. Measurable disease Measurable disease must be present either on physical examination or imaging studies; non-measurable disease alone is not acceptable. Any tumor mass > 1.5 cm is acceptable.\n\n   Lesions that are considered non-measurable include the following:\n   * Bone lesions (lesions if present should be noted)\n   * Ascites\n   * Pleural/pericardial effusion\n   * Lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis\n   * Bone marrow (involvement by lymphoma should be noted)\n5. Adequate hematologic function independent of transfusion and growth factor support for at least 3 weeks prior to screening unless attributable to disease. Defined as:\n\n   * Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >1000 cells/mm3 (1.0 x 109/L). ANC > 500 cells/mm3 is permissible if due to disease.\n   * Platelet count >50,000 cells/mm3 (50 x 109/L) unless attributable to disease. Platelet count > 20,000 cells/mm3 is permissible if due to disease.\n   * Hemoglobin >8.0 g/dL.\n6. Adequate hepatic and renal function defined as:\n\n   * Serum aspartate transaminase (AST) or alanine transaminase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) Serum aspartate transaminase (AST) or alanine transaminase (ALT) ≤ 5 is permissible if due to disease.\n   * Bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN (unless bilirubin rise is due to Gilbert's syndrome or of non-hepatic origin) Bilirubin ≤3 x ULN is permissible if due to disease.\n   * Estimated Creatinine Clearance ≥50 ml/min (Cockcroft-Gault based on actual weight)\n7.
