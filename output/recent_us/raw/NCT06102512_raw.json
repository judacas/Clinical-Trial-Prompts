Men must agree to effective contraception from the time of registration for treatment to 7 months post last treatment with nivolumab. 16 WOCBP who are continuously not heterosexually active are exempt from contraceptive requirements. However, WOCBP must still undergo pregnancy testing as described in these sections.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Patients must not have any other malignancies within the past 2 years except for in situ carcinoma of any site, or adequately treated (without recurrence post-resection or post-radiotherapy) carcinoma of the cervix or basal or squamous cell carcinomas of the skin.\n2. Patients currently receiving anticancer therapies or who have received anticancer therapies (including chemotherapy and targeted therapy) within 2 weeks (14 days) prior to study Day 1 are excluded. Patients who have completed palliative radiation therapy more than 14 days prior to the first dose of the combination immunotherapy are eligible.\n3. Patients with persistent grade ≥2 adverse events from prior systemic therapies that would confound timely detection of immune-related adverse events or otherwise hinder patient participation in the clinical trial.\n4. Patients, who have had a major surgery or significant traumatic injury (injury requiring > 4 weeks (28 days) to heal) within 4 weeks (28 days) of start of study drug, patients who have not recovered from the side effects of any major surgery (defined as requiring general anesthesia) or patients that are expected to require major surgery, other than cytoreductive nephrectomy ± retroperitoneal lymph node dissection, during the course of the study.\n5. Patients who have organ allografts.\n6. Known or suspected autoimmune disease. Patients with a history of inflammatory bowel disease (including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) and autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic progressive sclerosis [scleroderma], Systemic Lupus Erythematosus or autoimmune vasculitis [e.g., Wegener's Granulomatosis] are excluded from this study.

Positive test for hepatitis B virus (HBV) using HBV surface antigen (HBVsAg) test or positive test for hepatitis C virus (HCV) using HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) or HCV antibody test indicating acute or chronic infection. If hepatitis C antibody test is positive then active infection has to be confirmed by hepatitis C RNA testing for the patient to be excluded.\n9. Any underlying medical condition, which in the opinion of the Investigator, will make the administration of study drug hazardous or obscure the interpretation of adverse events, such as a condition associated with frequent diarrhea, uncontrolled nausea or vomiting. Patients with active COVID-19 disease as indicated by a positive polymerase reaction (PCR) test are excluded.\n\n   Patients with previous COVID-19 disease are allowed if ≥30 days from last positive test, and COVID-19 symptoms have resolved and/or PCR test is now negative\n10.

When repeat levels within 24 hours are not available, a repeat test should be conducted as soon as possible. If TnT or TnI repeat levels beyond 24 hours are < 2 × ULN, the participant may undergo a cardiac consultation and be considered for treatment, following cardiologist recommendation. Notification of the decision to enroll the participant following cardiologist recommendation has to be made to the MD Anderson Medical Monitor or designee.\n15.

Patients must not have history of other diseases, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that contraindicates the use of nivolumab or relatlimab or that might affect the interpretation of the results of the study or render the subject at high risk from treatment complications.\n19. Patients should not receive immunization with attenuated live vaccines within one week (7 days) of registration for treatment or during study period.\n\n    a. Note: Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.\n20.
