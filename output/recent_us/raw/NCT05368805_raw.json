    "exclusion_criteria": "* Autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant performed within 100 days prior to study drug administration in Day 1 of Cycle 1 of protocol therapy\n\n  * However, patients who received allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) more than 100 days are allowed if no active graft versus host disease (GVHD) > grade 1, not actively on systemic immunosuppressive therapy and off calcineurin inhibitors for at least 4 weeks prior to start therapy\n* Chemotherapy, radiation therapy, biological therapy, within 14 days prior to Day 1 of protocol therapy. Maintenance-type ALL chemotherapies, including vincristine and mercaptopurine are allowed up to 7 days before starting therapy. High dose steroids are allowed up to 3 days before starting therapy. Cytoreduction with hydroxyurea is allowed to control leukocytosis until to the day of starting therapy. Hydroxyurea can be given during cycle 1 of flotetuzumab administration to control leukocytosis but need to be discussed with the study PI\n* Previous treatment with immunotherapeutic agents (for example chimeric antigen receptor [CAR] T cells, long acting bispecific antibodies, etc) in the 28 days period prior to study drug administration on Day 1 Cycle 1, with the exception of short-half bispecific antibodies (blinatumomab) where the washout period is only 14 days\n* Requirement, at the time of study entry, for concurrent steroid > 10 mg/day of oral prednisone or the equivalent, except steroid inhaler, nasal spray or ophthalmic solution\n* Use of immunosuppressant medications (other than steroid as noted above) in the 2 weeks prior to study drug administration (Cycle 1 Day 1)\n* Known central nervous system involvement. Patients with suspected CNS involvement must be evaluated by lumbar puncture and be free of CNS disease prior to study entry. Previously treated CNS involvement is allowed provided adequate treatment has been provided and the patient is free of CNS disease\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to flotetuzumab\n* Any active untreated autoimmune disorders (with the exception of vitiligo)\n* Dementia or altered mental status that would preclude sufficient understanding to provide informed consent\n* Second primary malignancy that requires active therapy. Adjuvant hormonal therapy is allowed\n* Active uncontrolled infection\n* Significant pulmonary compromise\n* Unstable angina or clinically significant heart disease (left ventricular ejection fraction < 50%)\n* Major trauma or surgery within 4 weeks before enrollment\n* Clinically significant uncontrolled illness\n* Females only: Pregnant or breastfeeding\n* Any other condition that would, in the Investigator's judgment, contraindicate the patient's participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns with clinical study procedures\n* Prospective participants who, in the opinion of the investigator, may not be able to comply with all study procedures (including compliance issues related to feasibility/logistics)",
