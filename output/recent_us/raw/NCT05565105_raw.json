Mostly bed bound\n* Unstable angina (angina symptoms at rest), new-onset angina (begun =< 3 months prior to randomization) or myocardial infarction =< 6 months prior to randomization\n* Cardiac arrhythmias requiring anti-arrhythmic therapy.

(Systolic blood pressure > 140 mmHg or diastolic pressure > 90 mmHg despite optimal medical management)\n* History of or current pheochromocytoma\n* Arterial or venous thrombotic or embolic events such as cerebrovascular accident (including transient ischemic attacks), deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism =< 6 months prior to randomization\n* Ongoing infection > grade 2 National Cancer Institute (NCI)-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v)5.0\n* Known history of chronic hepatitis B or C\n* Patients with seizure disorder requiring medication\n* Symptomatic metastatic brain or meningeal tumors unless the patient is > 6 months from definitive therapy, has a negative imaging study within 4 weeks of randomization and is clinically stable with respect to the tumor at the time of randomization. Note: Patient must not be undergoing acute steroid therapy or taper (chronic steroid therapy is acceptable provided that the dose is stable for one month prior to and following screening radiographic studies)\n* History of organ allograft (including corneal transplant)\n* Evidence or history of bleeding diathesis or any hemorrhage or bleeding event > CTCAE v5.0 grade 3 =< 4 weeks prior to randomization\n* Non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture\n* Substance abuse, medical, psychological or social conditions that may interfere with the patient?s participation in the study or evaluation of the study results\n* High-frequency microsatellite instability (MSI-H) patients who have not received prior PD-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy\n* Concurrent anti-cancer therapy =< 3 weeks from randomization (chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery, immunotherapy, biologic therapy, or tumor embolization)\n* Known hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs, study drug classes, or excipients in the formulation\n* Interstitial lung disease with ongoing signs and symptoms at the time of informed consent\n* History of known persistent proteinuria of CTCAE v5.0 grade 3 or higher (>= 3.5 g/24 hrs)\n* Any malabsorption condition\n* Unresolved toxicity greater than CTCAE v5.0 grade 1 attributed to any prior therapy/procedure excluding alopecia and oxaliplatin induced neurotoxicity =< grade 2\n* Albumin levels < 2.5 g/dl\n* Any of the following because this study involves an agent that has known genotoxic, mutagenic and teratogenic effects:\n\n  * Pregnant women\n  * Nursing women\n  * Men or women of childbearing potential who are unwilling to employ adequate contraception\n  * NOTE: Men and women of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception beginning at the signing of the informed consent form (ICF) until at least 3 months after the last dose of study drug.
