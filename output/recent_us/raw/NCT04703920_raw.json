Eligible female subjects must also have a negative pregnancy test at the screening and baseline visit.\n8. Males must agree to the use an acceptable form of contraception (as defined in section 8.4.4.1) during sexual contact with a pregnant female or a female of childbearing potential while participating in the study (e.g., male condom with diaphragm, male condom with cervical cap, or male condom in association with spermicide).\n9.

Other clinically significant, active or progressive (over the past 12 months) disease of the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, renal, dermatologic, neurologic, genitourinary, endocrine, rheumatologic or hematologic systems that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would compromise the subject's participation in the study, might confound the results of the study, or pose additional risk in administering the study drug.\n23.

Known or suspected history of alcohol or substance abuse (a stable and regular use of medical marijuana for non-neuropathic indications is acceptable).\n25.
