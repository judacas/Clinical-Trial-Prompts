    "official_title": "A Phase II Study of Multiparametric MR-Guided High Dose Adaptive Radiotherapy With Concurrent Temozolomide in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Provision of signed and dated informed consent form\n* Stated willingness to comply with all study procedures and availability for the duration of the study\n* Newly diagnosed, histologically-confirmed supratentorial WHO grade IV gliomas including glioblastoma (all variants) and gliosarcoma. Prior low-grade glioma without prior RT, now with malignant progression are eligible.\n* Karnofsky performance status >=70\n* Minimal life expectancy of 12 weeks\n* Adequate bone marrow reserve (Hemoglobin ≥ 10 g/dL, absolute neutrophils ≥ 1500/mm3, platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3), acceptable liver function (total bilirubin ≤ 2 x upper limit of normal (ULN) (unless elevated bilirubin is related to Gilbert syndrome), and ALT/AST ≤ 5 x ULN) and renal function (serum creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dL) within 14 day prior to registration. Eligibility level for hemoglobin may be reached by transfusion.\n* Maximal contiguous diameter of tumor based on high b-value diffusion MRI and DCE perfusion MRI ≤5 cm\n* Patients must be registered within 6 weeks of most recent resection\n* Females of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 14 days prior to registration. Patients with reproductive potential must agree to use an effective contraceptive method during treatment and study participation.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Recurrent glioma, or tumor involving the brainstem or cerebellum\n* Prior use of Gliadel wafers or any other intratumoral or intracavitary treatment is not permitted. Prior chemotherapy for a different cancer is allowable if interval since last treatment cycle completion is >3 years.\n* Evidence of CSF dissemination (positive CSF cytology for malignancy or MRI findings consistent with CSF dissemination)\n* Evidence of severe concurrent disease requiring treatment\n* Prior invasive malignancy (except non-melanoma skin cancer or non-life limiting invasive malignancy that may not require treatment, such as low-risk prostate cancer) unless disease free for a minimum of 3 years (for example, carcinoma in situ of breast, oral cavity or cervix are all permissible)\n* Patients unable to undergo MRI exams (i.e. patients with non-compatible devices such as cardiac pacemakers, other implanted electronic devices, metallic prostheses, or ferromagnetic prostheses [e.g. pins in artificial joints and surgical pins/clips], or unable to receive gadolinium for MRI, as per the standard Department of Radiology MRI screening criteria)\n* Patients treated with previous cranial or head/neck radiotherapy leading to significant radiation field overlap as determined by treating physician\n* Multifocal disease (>1 lobe of involvement) of discontiguous contrast enhancing disease as seen on conventional MRI\n* Pregnancy or lactation",
