Patients with history of non-invasive (Ta, Tis) upper tract urothelial carcinoma that have been definitively treated with at least one post-treatment disease assessment (i.e., cytology, biopsy, imaging) that demonstrates no evidence of residual disease are eligible. Previously treated or concurrent non-invasive (Ta, Tis) urethra carcinoma is allowed, but history of or concurrent invasive urethra carcinoma is excluded\n* Patients may not have another malignancy that could interfere with the evaluation of safety or efficacy of of SG.
