Patients requiring pain medication must be on a stable regimen at study entry. Symptomatic lesions (e.g. bone metastases causing nerve impingement) amenable to palliative radiotherapy should be treated prior to enrollment. Patient should be recovered from effects of radiation. There is no required minimum recovery period. Asymptomatic metastatic lesions that would likely cause functional deficits or intractable pain with further growth (e.g.,epidural metastasis that is not currently associated with spinal cord compression) should be considered for loco-regional therapy if appropriate prior to enrollment).\n* Uncontrolled pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, or ascites requiring recurrent drainage procedures (one monthly or more frequently).\n* Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥160 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥95 mmHg).

Patients currently treated with anti-viral therapy for HBV. Subjects with a past or resolved HBV infection, defined as having a negative HBsAg and HBV PCR test and a positive total hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) test at screening, are eligible for the study.\n* Active hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, defined as having a positive HCV antibody test followed by a positive HCV RNA test at screening. The HCV RNA test will be performed only for subjects who have a positive HCV antibody test.\n* History of adrenal dysfunction\n* Uncontrolled or symptomatic hypercalcemia (ionized calcium >1.5 mmol/L, calcium > 12 mg/dL or corrected serum calcium > ULN)\n* Active or history of autoimmune disease or immune deficiency, including, but not limited to, myasthenia gravis, myositis, autoimmune hepatitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, Wegener granulomatosis, Sjogren syndrome, Guillain-Barre syndrome, or multiple sclerosis, with the following exceptions:\n\n  * Subjects with a history of autoimmune-related hypothyroidism who are on thyroid replacement hormone\n  * Subjects with controlled Type 1 diabetes mellitus who are on an insulin regimen\n  * Subjects with eczema, psoriasis, lichen simplex chronicus, or vitiligo with dermatologic manifestations only (e.g., subjects with psoriatic arthritis are excluded) are allowed provided all the following conditions are met:\n* Rash must cover < 10% of body surface area\n* Disease is well controlled at baseline and requires only low-potency topical corticosteroids\n* No occurrence of acute exacerbations of the underlying condition requiring psoralen plus ultraviolet A radiation, methotrexate, retinoids, biologic agents, oral calcineurin inhibitors, or high potency or oral corticosteroids within the previous 12 months\n* History of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, organizing pneumonia (e.g., bronchiolitis obliterans), drug-induced pneumonitis, or idiopathic pneumonitis, or evidence of active pneumonitis on screening chest computed tomography (CT) scan\n* Active tuberculosis\n* Significant cardiovascular disease (such as New York Heart Association Class II or greater cardiac disease, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, unstable arrhythmia or unstable angina) within 6 months prior to initiation of study treatment\n* Major surgical procedure, other than for diagnosis, within 4 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment, or anticipation of need for a major surgical procedure during the study\n* Severe infection within 4 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment, including, but not limited to, hospitalization for complications of infection, bacteremia, or severe pneumonia\n* Prior allogeneic stem cell or solid organ transplantation\n\n  * Treatment with a live, attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment, or anticipation of need for such a vaccine during atezolizumab treatment or within 5 months after the final dose of atezolizumab\n* Treatment with therapeutic oral or IV antibiotics within 2 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment.
