Only in cases where the Investigator (or the treating physician or both) suspects cardiac disease with negative effect on the EF will the EF be measured during screening using an appropriate method according to local standards to confirm eligibility (e.g. echocardiogram [ECHO], multi-gated acquisition scan [MUGA]. A historic measurement of EF no older than 6 months prior to first study treatment administration can be accepted provided that there is clinical evidence that the EF value has not worsened since this measurement in the opinion of the Investigator or the treating physician or both.\n\nSpecific to Cohorts 3, 4a, 4b:\n\n1.
