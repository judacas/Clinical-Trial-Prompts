Patients with NSCLC, MM, TNBC, and HNSCC must have measurable disease per RECIST 1.1. Patients with HL must have at least one measurable lesion > 1.5 cm for nodal, > 1.0 cm for extranodal FDG-avid disease by the Lugano (2014) response criteria.

Adequate bone marrow function defined by absolute neutrophil (ANC) of ≥ 1.5×109/L, platelet count of ≥ 100.0×109/L, and hemoglobin of ≥ 9.0 g/dL (with or without transfusion)\n6. Adequate hepatic function defined as serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × ULN, AST/ALT ≤ 2.5 × ULN (or ≤ 5 × ULN in patients with liver metastases)\n7. Adequate renal function defined as creatinine clearance ≥ 30mL/min by Cockcroft-Gault equation\n8. Female patients must be surgically sterile (or have a monogamous partner who is surgically sterile) or be at least 2 years postmenopausal or commits to use 2 acceptable forms of birth control (defined as the use of an intrauterine device (IUD), a barrier method with spermicide, condoms, any form of hormonal contraceptives) or abstinence for the duration of the study and for 4 months following the last dose of study treatment. Male patients must be sterile (biologically or surgically) or commit to the use of a reliable method of birth control (condoms with spermicide) for the duration of the study and for 4 months following the last dose of study treatment.\n9. Female patients who are women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum pregnancy test at Screening within 7 days of dosing with CTX-8371\n10. Last dose of previous PD-1 or PD-L1 therapy ≥ 28 days, other anticancer therapy > 21 days (or 2 half-lives for proteins, whichever is longer), radiotherapy >21 days (concurrent localized palliative radiotherapy is allowed during CTX-8371 treatment), or surgical intervention >21 days prior to the first dose of CTX-8371\n11. Resolution of all prior anti-cancer therapy toxicities ≤ Grade 2\n12. Capable of understanding and complying with protocol requirements\n13. Signed and dated institutional review board (IRB)/independent ethics committee (IEC)-approved informed consent form (ICF) before any protocol-directed screening procedures are performed\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Developed clinically significant adverse reaction to PD-1 or PD-L1 therapy, including immune related adverse reactions, which led to discontinuation of treatment\n2. Systemic therapy with immunosuppressive agents within 7 days before the start of CTX-8371 treatment.

Prior organ transplantation\n5. Patients with evidence of active hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Patients with positive HBsAg and/or detectable HBV DNA are eligible only if adequately controlled on antiviral therapy according to institutional standards and liver function eligibility criteria are also met. HCV patients showing sustained viral response or patients with immunity to HBV infection may enroll.\n6.
