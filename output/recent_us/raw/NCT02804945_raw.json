    "inclusion_criteria": "* INCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\nIn order to be eligible to participate in this study, an individual must meet all of the following criteria.\n\n* Histological confirmation of peritoneal carcinomatosis from colorectal, appendiceal, small bowel, gastric, cholangiocarcinoma, breast, ovarian, or other gynecologic (i.e., endometrial, fallopian tube, primary peritoneal, cervical) primary by the Laboratory of Pathology, NCI.\n* Participants must have been treated with at least one line of approved systemic chemotherapy, with demonstrated resistance or lack of response\n* Measurable or evaluable disease as defined by RECIST v1.1. criteria and/or by Peritoneal Carcinomatosis Index (PCI)\n* Participants must be assessed to not be candidates for cytoreductive surgery, with laparoscopically assessed PCI score thresholds as indicated below:\n\n  --Primary Histology PCI Cutoff for Eligibility\n  * Gastric Total Score >= 10 (out of 39 possible points)\n  * Others Total Score >= 20 (out of 39 possible points)\n  * Any Jejunoileal Score >= 4 (out of 12 possible points)\n* Age >= 18 years\n* ECOG performance status <= 2 (Karnofsky >= 60%).\n* Participants must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:\n\n  * Absolute neutrophil count >= 1,000/mcL\n  * Platelets >= 100,000/mcL\n  * Total bilirubin within <= 1.5x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)\n  * AST (SGOT)/ ALT (SGPT) <= 3x institutional ULN, or <= 5.0x ULN in participants with liver metastases (only)\n  * Serum potassium and magnesium greater than institutional lower limit of normal\n  * Creatinine <= 1.5 mg/dL or creatinine clearance >= 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2 for participants with creatinine levels above institutional normal calculated using eGFR\n* Nursing (including breastfeeding) participant must agree to discontinue nursing.\n* Individuals of child-bearing potential (IOCBP) must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation and for 90 days after last study treatment. Should an individual of child-bearing potential suspect to be pregnant while participating in this study, the individual should inform the treating physician immediately.\n* Ability of participant to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n* Participants must agree to co-enrollment on the tissue collection protocol 13C0176, Tumor, Normal Tissue and Specimens from Patients Undergoing Evaluation or Surgical Resection of Solid Tumors\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\nAn individual who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation in this study.\n\n* Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents or who have received an investigational agent within 30 days prior to the start of study treatment.\n* Participants with a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to study drugs.\n* Participants who have received systemic (i.e., oral or intravenous) chemotherapy or other anti-cancer therapy (i.e., immunotherapy) within either 5 half-lives or within 30 days of the last dose of individual agent(s) administered prior to the start of study treatment, whichever is shorter.\n* Participants who have undergone major abdominal surgery within the last 12 weeks prior to the start of study treatment.\n\nNote: Exclusion of participants who have undergone major abdominal surgery within the last 12 weeks prior to start of study treatment is to allow for scar tissue formation from that surgery to stabilize. Participant ECOG performance status will be checked to account for prolonged or difficult recoveries from other types of major surgery that would appropriately influence eligibility assessment.\n\n* Participants who have received previous intraperitoneal chemotherapy within the last 6 months prior to the start of study treatment\n* Participants requiring the use of drugs known to prolong the QT interval or known to strongly inhibit CYP3A4, 2C8. Participants on such agents at the time of screening are permitted on study if an alternative that does not have the same pharmacokinetic interactions can be found.\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. Note: No subject will be excluded based on a social situation prior to consultation with the Department of Social Work.\n* Pregnant individuals are excluded from this study.\n* Participants with HIV who have detectable viral load, or whose ART contains QTc Prolonging Medications or CYP3A4 Inhibitors regardless of viral load. (NOTE: Participants with HIV who have an undetectable viral load and have been on stable doses of ART that does not prolong the QT interval or is a strong CYP3A4, 2C8 inhibitor are eligible).\n* QTcF interval of >= 450 msec at study entry, or congenital long QT syndrome.\n* More than 3 liters of ascites present at initial laparoscopy, or history of more than two therapeutic paracentesis procedures, each yielding at least 1.5 liters of fluid, in the 30 days prior to initial laparoscopy, or confirmation of predominantly mucinous ascites at\n\nthe time of screening laparoscopy.\n\n* Advanced hepatic failure, as indicated by Child-Pugh Class C cirrhosis.\n* Sensory/motor neuropathy >= Grade 2\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
