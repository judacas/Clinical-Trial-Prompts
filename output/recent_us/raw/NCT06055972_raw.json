    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Histologically or cytologically documented locally advanced or recurrent NSCLC that is not eligible for curative surgery and/or definitive radiotherapy, with or without chemotherapy, or metastatic non-squamous or squamous NSCLC.\n2. No prior systemic therapy for locally advanced or metastatic squamous or non-squamous NSCLC, including but not limited to chemotherapy or targeted therapy. Participants who have received prior neoadjuvant, adjuvant chemotherapy, or chemoradiotherapy with curative intent for nonmetastatic disease must have experienced a disease-free interval of ≥ 6 months from the last dose of chemotherapy and/or concurrent radiotherapy prior to randomization.\n3. Archival tumor tissue or fresh biopsy (if archival tissue is not available) for the determination of PD-L1 levels and retrospective analyses of other biomarkers. Only participantswho have evaluable PD-L1 results are eligible.\n4. At least one measurable lesion by the investigator per RECIST v1.1.\n\n   .\n5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status ≤ 1.\n\nKey\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Known mutations in:\n\n   * EGFR gene Note: For non-squamous NSCLC, articipants with unknown EGFR mutation status will be required to have a tissue-based EGFR test either locally or at the central laboratory before enrollment, or endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA)-based EGFR test locally. Participants found to have EGFR-sensitizing mutations will be excluded.\n   * ALK fusion oncogene.\n   * BRAF V600E\n   * ROS1\n2. Prior treatment with EGFR inhibitors, ALK inhibitors, or targeted therapy for other driver mutations.\n3. Any prior therapy targeting T-cell costimulation or checkpoint pathways in metastatic NSCLC.\n4. Any condition that required systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (> 10 mg daily of prednisone or equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medication ≤ 14 days before randomization.\n5. Infection (including tuberculosis infection, etc.) requiring systemic antibacterial, antifungal, or antiviral therapy within 14 days before randomization.\n\nNote: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.",
