Patients must have adequate renal and hepatic function\n\n   * Total bilirubin ≤1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN).

    "exclusion_criteria": "1. History of another primary invasive malignancy that has not been definitively treated or in remission for at least 2 years. Patients with non-melanoma skin cancers or with carcinomas in situ are eligible regardless of the time from diagnosis (including concomitant diagnoses). If patients have another malignancy that was treated within the last 2 years, such patients may be enrolled if the likelihood of requiring systemic therapy for this other malignancy within 2 years is less than 10%, as determined by an expert in that particular malignancy at MD Anderson Cancer Center and after consultation with the Principal Investigator\n2. Any major surgery or wound that has not healed, radiotherapy, cytotoxic chemotherapy, biologic therapy, immunotherapy, immunomodulatory drugs, experimental therapy within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of the study drugs.\n3. Significant cardiovascular disease such as uncontrolled or symptomatic arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, or myocardial infarction within 6 months of screening, or any Class 3 or 4 cardiac disease as defined by the New York Heart Association Functional Classification.\n4. History of stroke or cerebral hemorrhage within 6 months of enrollment.\n5. Patients who have uncontrolled hypertension (defined as sustained systolic blood pressure ≥ 160 mmHg or diastolic ≥ 100 mmHg)\n6. Prior history of BTK inhibitor or PD1 inhibitor prior to start of trial.\n7. Active, uncontrolled autoimmune hemolytic anemia or immune thrombocytopenia requiring steroid therapy.\n8. Patients with autoimmune diseases are excluded: Patients with a history of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) are excluded from this study as are patients with a history of autoimmune disease (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, systemic progressive sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Wegener's granulomatosis).\n9. Patients with previous allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) within 6 months or with active acute or chronic graft-versus host disease are excluded. Patients must be off immunosuppression for GVHD for at least 30 days before cycle 1 day 1.\n10. Patients with organ allografts (such as renal transplant) are excluded.\n11. History of biopsy proven interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis which has impacted PFT in a clinically significant manner.\n12. Patients who are on high dose steroids (>10mg daily of prednisone or equivalent) or immune suppression medications. Note: Patients on high-dose steroids (doses >10mg/day of prednisone or equivalent) or immune suppression medications are eligible provided these drugs are discontinued at least 3 days prior to starting on the study drugs.\n13. Patients with uncontrolled active infection (viral, bacterial, and fungal) are not eligible.\n14. Active current hepatitis B or C infection/reactivation as measured by DNA/RNA quantification, or known seropositivity for HIV.\n15. Patient is pregnant or breast-feeding.\n16. Malabsorption syndrome or other condition that precludes enteral route of administration.\n17. Concomitant use of warfarin or other Vitamin K antagonists.\n18. Requires chronic treatment with a strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A inhibitor (see Appendix 3).\n19. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that in the opinion of the investigator may increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and/or would make the patient inappropriate for enrollment into this study.\n20. Vaccinated with live, attenuated vaccines within 4 weeks of enrollment.\n21. Any life-threatening illness, medical condition, or organ system dysfunction which, in the investigator's opinion, could compromise the subject's safety, interfere with the absorption or metabolism of ibrutinib capsules, or put the study outcomes at undue risk.",
