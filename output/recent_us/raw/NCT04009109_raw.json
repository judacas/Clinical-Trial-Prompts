Female subjects that meet one of the following:\n\n   1.

    "exclusion_criteria": "1.

Body mass index < 18.5 or ≥ 30 kg/m^2 (> 40 kg/m^2 for PKU subjects).\n3. History of or current immunodeficiency disorder including autoimmune disorders and human immunodeficiency virus antibody positivity.\n4.

Currently taking or plans to take any type of systemic (e.g., oral or intravenous) antibiotic within 28 days prior to the anticipated first dose of IP through the final outpatient follow-up. Exception: topical antibiotics are allowed.\n14. Major surgery (an operation upon an organ within the cranium, chest, abdomen, or pelvic cavity) or inpatient hospital stay within the 3 months prior to the anticipated first dose of IP.\n15.
