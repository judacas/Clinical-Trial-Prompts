After at least 14 weeks dosage (example, at least 4 doses) of infliximab (including biosimilars) Documented IR may include inadequate improvement or loss in response after initial improvement in joint counts or other parameters of disease activity\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 75 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Has a confirmed or suspected clinical immunodeficiency syndrome not related to treatment of RA or has a family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency unless confirmed absent\n* Is (anatomically or functionally) asplenic\n* Has experienced myocardial infarction, unstable ischemic heart disease, or stroke less than or equal to (<=) 12 weeks of screening\n* Has a diagnosis of congestive heart failure including medically controlled, asymptomatic congestive heart failure\n* Has a history of known demyelinating disease such as multiple sclerosis or optic neuritis",
