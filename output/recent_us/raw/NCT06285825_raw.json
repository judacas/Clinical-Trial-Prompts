    "inclusion_criteria": "* Participants must have histologically (via at least a core or ideally, incisional or excisional biopsy) documented CD20 positive or negative diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)\n* Tissue available from the diagnostic biopsy in the form of blocks, tissue cores, or slides available for submission to central pathology is required for all participants enrolled to this study; formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue from diagnostic tissue is acceptable and recommended; submission of the institutional diagnostic slides is also preferred for all participants enrolled in the study\n* Stage II-IV disease; participant will need measurable disease by computed tomography (CT) or positron emission tomography (PET) scans if enrolled in the dose-expansion cohort\n* HIV positive; documentation of HIV-1 infection by means of any one of the following:\n\n  * Documentation of HIV diagnosis in the medical record by a licensed health care provider;\n  * Documentation of receipt of ART (at least three different medications) by a licensed health care provider (documentation may be a record of an antiretroviral therapy (ART) prescription in the participant's medical record, a written prescription in the name of the participant for ART, or pill bottles for ART with a label showing the participant's name);\n  * HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) detection by a licensed HIV-1 RNA assay demonstrating > 1000 RNA copies/mL;\n  * Any licensed HIV screening antibody and/or HIV antibody/antigen combination assay confirmed by a second licensed HIV assay such as a HIV-1 western blot confirmation or HIV rapid multispot antibody differentiation assay\n  * NOTE: a \"licensed\" assay refers to a United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved assay, which is required for all investigational food drug (IND) studies\n* Only participants whose lymphoma is untreated are allowed for the dose-finding portion; for the dose expansion cohort both untreated and participants who have received a maximum of one cycle of combination chemotherapy, including rituximab-containing regimens R-cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, vincristine sulfate, prednisone (CHOP) and R-EPOCH, prior are eligible; the start of previous chemotherapy cycle must occur at least 21 days prior and 28 days maximum to beginning treatment under this protocol, and such cycle will count towards the maximum of 6 cycles under this study (i.e. cycle off study will count as cycle 1)\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =< 2 (Karnofsky >= 50%)\n* CD4 count >= 100 in the dose-finding cohort; once the dose-finding cohort is complete and if safety is established, participants with any CD4 count, including CD4 count < 100, will be allowed in the dose-escalation phase\n* Absolute neutrophil count: >= 1,000/mm^3, unless decreased due to bone marrow involvement with lymphoma\n* Platelets: >= 75,000/mm^3, unless decreased due to bone marrow involvement with lymphoma\n* Total bilirubin: =< 1.5 institutional upper limit of normal (ULN); if potential due to lymphoma, the first cycle may be given without ibrutinib and if transaminitis and bilirubinemia improves to meet parameters, participant mat be enrolled on the clinical trial\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT]): < 2 institutional ULN; if potentially due to lymphoma, the first cycle will be given without ibrutinib and if transaminitis and bilirubinemia improves to meet parameters, participant may be enrolled on trial\n* Creatinine levels within normal institutional limits; or, creatinine clearance >= 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2 for participants with creatinine levels above institutional normal; unless decreased due to renal involvement by lymphoma\n* Participants must not be on medications, including antiretroviral (ARV) regimens such as cobicistat, indinavir, or ritonavir, or agents with moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibition; if on a moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitor regimen prior to study enrollment, participants must be switched to a qualifying regimen with the last dose of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor taken at least one week before administration of ibrutinib\n* Willingness of sexually active participants to use adequate contraception; both men and women of child-bearing potential treated or enrolled on this study must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) before study entry, for the duration of study participation, 90 days after completion of ibrutinib, and 12 months after the last dose of rituximab, whichever comes last; men who only have sex with other men do not need to use contraception specifically for this study (should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately)\n* All participants will be required to be screened for hepatitis B; all participants who present with acute hepatitis B or show normal transaminases and are hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive (+) and IgM+ for hepatitis core antigen will not be eligible for trial enrollment; per Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and Assistance for AIDS Specific Drugs (AASD) guidelines, those participants that show no immunity, defined by the lack of hepatitis B surface antibody, and show evidence of chronic infection (i.e. hepatitis B [HB]sAg+, HBcore+, hepatitis B surface antibody [HBsAB] negative [-]) will be required to be on anti-hepatitis B therapy, during the study, in order to be eligible; the exact hepatitis B therapy will be at the discretion of the infection disease specialist or investigator; if infected with hepatitis B, participants will be permitted to enroll in the study provided liver function tests meet criteria listed above, there is no evidence of cirrhosis AND participants will be required to be on anti-hepatitis B therapy\n* All participants will be required to be screened for hepatitis C; if hepatitis C antibody positive, with or without a positive hepatitis C RNA level, participants will be permitted to enroll in the study provided liver function tests meet criteria listed, and have no evidence of cirrhosis; participants diagnosed with hepatitis C less than 6 months from trial enrollment will be considered to have acute hepatitis C, and will be excluded from study UNLESS hepatitis C viral load is undetectable\n* Adequate cardiac function defined as an ejection fraction on echocardiogram (ECHO) or multi-gated acquisition (MUGA) that is at or above the institutional normal limits\n* Participants must be able to swallow oral pills\n* Ability to understand and willing to sign a written informed consent document\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
