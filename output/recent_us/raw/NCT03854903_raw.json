    "exclusion_criteria": "* Any evidence of spinal cord compression (radiological or clinical)\n* Prior pelvic malignancy\n* Prior pelvic radiation\n* Concurrent malignancy other than adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), or any other cancer in situ currently without evidence of recurrence or progression\n* Inability to undergo radiotherapy, or hormonal therapy\n* Primary small cell carcinoma of the prostate (prostate adenocarcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation is allowed)\n* Inflammatory bowel disease or active collagen vascular disease\n* History of any of the following:\n\n  * Seizure or known condition that may pre-dispose to seizure (e.g. prior stroke within 1 year to randomization, brain arteriovenous malformation, Schwannoma, meningioma, or other benign central nervous system [CNS] or meningeal disease which may require treatment with surgery or radiation therapy)\n  * Severe or unstable angina, myocardial infarction, symptomatic congestive heart failure, arterial or venous thromboembolic events (eg, pulmonary embolism, cerebrovascular accident including transient ischemic attacks), or clinically significant ventricular arrhythmias within 6 months prior to randomization\n* Current evidence of any of the following:\n\n  * Uncontrolled hypertension\n  * Gastrointestinal disorder affecting absorption\n  * Known active infection (eg, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] or viral hepatitis)\n  * Any condition that in the opinion of the investigator would preclude participation in this study\n  * Treatment with CYP2D6 substrates that have a narrow therapeutic index. If an alternative treatment cannot be used, a dose reduction of the CYP2D6 substrate may be considered\n  * Baseline moderate and severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh class B & C)",
