Presence of a facial port-wine birthmark (PWB) indicating a risk for SWS and/or evidence of SWS brain involvement based on the presence of one or more intracranial SWS brain abnormalities from previous clinical imaging (MRI or computed tomography) scan(s) with or without a facial PWB. SWS brain abnormalities can include both brain vascular and/or parenchymal abnormalities (including atrophy, calcification, etc.);\n   3. In children who will undergo formal neuropsychology testing including detailed language testing (age 3 years and above): proficiency of English language.\n2. Healthy control subjects:\n\n   1. Age 3 years - 30 years;\n   2. No history of neurological or psychiatric disorder\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 3 Months\nMust have maximum age of 30 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "For all subjects:\n\n1. Metal in the head or mouth that would preclude safe, artifact-free MRI scanning; or any other metal or electronic device contraindicated for MRI scanning.\n2. History of severe claustrophobia, precluding staying still in the scanner for up to 30 minutes.\n3. Pregnancy (pregnant women will be scheduled for the study after delivery).\n\nFor SWS subjects, who will receive MRI contrast material, additional exclusion criteria:\n\n1. History of sensitivity to MRI contrast material;\n2. History of renal disease that would preclude safe administration of MRI contrast material",
