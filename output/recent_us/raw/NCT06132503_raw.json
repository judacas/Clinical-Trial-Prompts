    "official_title": "Phase I Study of HER2 Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T Cells in Combination With Checkpoint Blockade in Patients With Advanced Sarcoma (HEROS 3.0)",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Diagnosis of a HER2-positive sarcoma. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) will be used to determine HER2 expression.45,138 Standard HER2 positive breast cancer density gradient tissue microarrays will be used as positive controls. HER2 expression will be graded for percent positive tumor cells (Grade 0: no staining; Grade 1: 1-25%; Grade 2: 26-50% and Grade 3: 51-100%) and intensity of staining (Negative; 1+; 2+; and 3+). For the patient to meet eligibility, tumors are required to have at least ≥ grade 1 and ≥ 1+ intensity score for HER2 staining.\n* Age between 1 to 25 years\n* Karnofsky or Lansky performance score of ≥ 60\n* Informed consent explained to, understood by, and signed by patient/guardian. Patient or guardian given copy of informed consent.\n\nTreatment Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Diagnosis of a HER2 positive sarcoma with active disease progression or recurrence after at least one prior systemic therapy\n* At least 4 weeks from and having recovered from acute toxic effects of all prior cytotoxic chemotherapy. Those receiving targeted (non-cytotoxic) drugs must be at least 7 days or 3 drug half-lives, whichever is greater, from last receipt of said drug and must have recovered from all acute toxic effects of that drug.\n* Normal cardiac left ventricular end diastolic function (LVEF) as measured by echocardiogram (normal per institutional limits)\n* Karnofsky or Lansky performance score of ≥60\n* Total bilirubin ≤1.5x upper limit of normal (ULN) for age AND direct bilirubin ≤ULN for age\n* AST/ALT ≤ 2.5x ULN\n* Serum creatinine ≤1.5x ULN for age\n* Hgb ≥ 7.0 g/dL (transfusion allowed)\n* WBC > 2,000/µl\n* ANC >1,000/ul\n* Platelets >75,000/ul (not transfused)\n* Pulse oximetry of ≥ 90% on room air\n* Sexually active males and females of childbearing potential must agree to use a form of contraception considered effective and medically acceptable by the investigator. Non-childbearing potential is defined as pre-menarche, greater than 1-year post-menopausal, or surgically sterilized.\n* Available autologous transduced cytotoxic T lymphocytes with ≥ 15% expression of HER2 CAR and killing of HER2-positive targets ≥ 20% in cytotoxicity assay\n* Informed consent explained to, understood by, and signed by patient or guardian. Patient or guardian given copy of informed consent.\n\nProcurement\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 1 Year\nMust have maximum age of 25 Years",
