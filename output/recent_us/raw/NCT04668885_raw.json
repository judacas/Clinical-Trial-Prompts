    "official_title": "Pilot Study of NP-101 (TQ Formula) in Combination with Nivolumab and Ipilimumab in Advanced and Metastatic Extra-pulmonary Neuroendocrine Carcinomas (EP-NECAs)",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Subjects must have histologically or cytologically confirmed of relapsed and/or refractory unresectable advanced and/or metastatic high-grade extra-pulmonary neuroendocrine carcinoma (EP-NECAs), and have failed at least one standard line of therapy.\n* Subjects must have received at least one prior therapy for this disease. Subjects must have recovered from acute toxicities of prior chemotherapy. Any prior non-hematologic vital organ toxicity (cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic, and renal) of previous therapy must have resolved to grade 1 or less. Neurological toxicities must have resolved to grade 2 or less.\n* Age >18 years.\n* Subjects must have radiologic disease measurable by RECIST criteria.\n* All previous chemotherapy or radiation must be completed at least three weeks prior to starting study treatment.\n* Performance status ECOG Performance status ≤ 2\n* Subjects must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:\n\n  * Hemoglobin ≥ 7.0 g/dl\n  * Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcL\n  * Platelet count ≥ 75,000/mcL\n  * Total bilirubin ≤ 3 X institutional upper limit of normal (except subjects with elevated bilirubin unrelated to liver dysfunction)\n  * AST (SGOT) ≤ 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal\n  * ALT (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal\n  * Serum Creatinine ≤ 1.5 X institutional upper limit of normal\n* Subjects must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n* Subjects of childbearing potential must agree to practice reliable contraception or to practice abstinence for at least 28 days before and for 60 days after the last dose of study drug. Reliable contraception is defined as:\n\n  * One highly effective method and one additional effective (barrier) method:\n  * Examples of highly effective methods:\n* Intrauterine device (IUD)\n* Hormonal (injections, implants, levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system [IUS], medroxyprogesterone acetate depot injections, ovulation inhibitory progesterone-only pills [e.g. desogestrel])\n* Tubal ligation\n* Partner's vasectomy\n\n  * Examples of additional effective methods:\n* Male condom\n* Diaphragm\n* Cervical Cap\n\nInclusion of Women and minorities\n\n* People of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this trial.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 80 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Well-differentiated GEP-NETs are excluded from this trial.\n* Prior treatment toxicities that have not resolved to ≤ Grade 2 according to NCI CTCAE Version 5.0 (list exceptions, e.g. alopecia, neuropathy, etc).\n* Subjects received prior nivolumab or ipilimumab\n* Subjects with untreated brain metastases/CNS disease will be excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events. Participants with treated oligometastatic CNS metastases will be considered for the study.\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to NP-101 (TQ Formula) or immunotherapy (nivolumab or ipilimumab) used in this study.\n* Subjects with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* Pregnant or breastfeeding women are excluded from this study because NP-101 (TQ Formula) effects on pregnancy and the fetus used in this protocol is unknown.\n* Known chronic active untreated hepatitis B or C infection.\n* HIV-positive subjects on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with NP-101 (TQ Formula) and immunotherapy agents.",
