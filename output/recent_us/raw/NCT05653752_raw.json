    "official_title": "A Multicenter, Open-label, First-in-Human Study of TYRA-200 in Advanced Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma and Other Solid Tumors With Activating FGFR2 Gene Alterations (SURF-201)",
    "inclusion_criteria": "Phase 1 Part A\n\n* Men and women 18 years of age or older.\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of ≤1.\n* Any histologically confirmed advanced solid tumor with FGFR/FGF pathway alterations including FGFR gene mutations, fusions, and amplifications, as well as gene amplifications of FGFR ligands, who have exhausted or refused approved standard therapies.\n* Evaluable disease according to RECIST v1.1.\n\nPhase 1 Part B\n\n* Men and women 18 years of age or older.\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of ≤1.\n* Histologically confirmed locally advanced/metastatic intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma with a previously identified FGFR2 gene mutation or rearrangement.\n* Must have received a prior FGFR inhibitor. Participants may have received more than 1 prior FGFR inhibitor.\n* Presence of an FGFR2 kinase domain mutation that confers resistance to previous/other FGFR inhibitors; resistance mutations should be identified by a US Food and Drug Administration authorized/approved companion diagnostic or a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) validated local test performed in a certified laboratory.\n* At least 1 measurable lesion by RECIST v1.1.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Discontinued a prior anti-FGFR therapy due to significant toxicity, defined as hepatotoxicity ≥Grade 3 or any Grade 4 toxicity according to CTCAE v5.0.\n* Has a serum phosphorus level > upper limit of normal (ULN) during screening that remains >ULN despite medical management.\n* Any ocular condition likely to increase the risk of eye toxicity.\n* History of or current uncontrolled cardiovascular disease.\n* Active, symptomatic, or untreated brain metastases.\n* Gastrointestinal disorders that will affect oral administration or absorption of TYRA-200.\n* Females who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant and males who plan to father a child while enrolled in this study.",
