    "official_title": "Evaluation of Patient Education Simulations to Promote Health and Wellness in Patients With Chronic Disease",
    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Age 18 years or older;\n2. Have a diagnosis of a chronic disease (e.g., osteoarthritis, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, diabetes, hypertension, stroke, and congestive heart failure) as indicated by self-report or review of the electronic medical record; and\n3.

    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Are unable to give informed consent\n2. Refuse to participate\n3. Any active terminal illness, mental incompetence, or uncontrolled psychiatric illness. These exclusions were based on the premise that the presence of any of these conditions would dominate the subject's perception of lifestyle management of their chronic disease.\n4. Unable to speak and read in English. Patients that are unable to speak and read in English will be excluded from the proposed project because the simulations are being developed in English only. Once we demonstrate the initial efficacy of this tool, future simulations will be developed in languages other than English. Despite the language restrictions, no exclusion will be made based on patient racial/ethnic origin.",
