for agents that have known adverse events occurring beyond 7 days after administration, this period must be extended beyond the time during which adverse events are known to occur; the duration of this interval must be discussed with the study chair and the study-assigned research coordinator\n  * Interleukins, interferons and cytokines (other than hematopoietic growth factors): >= 21 days must have elapsed from the last dose of interleukins, interferon or cytokines (other than hematopoietic growth factors)\n  * Stem cell infusions (with or without traumatic brain injury [TBI]):\n\n    * Allogeneic (non-autologous) bone marrow or stem cell transplant, or any stem cell infusion including donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) or boost infusion: >= 84 days must have elapsed from infusion and no evidence of graft versus host disease (GVHD)\n    * Autologous stem cell infusion including boost infusion: >= 42 days must have elapsed from infusion\n  * Cellular therapy: >= 42 days must have elapsed from last dose of any type of cellular therapy (e.g. modified T cells, natural killer [NK] cells, dendritic cells, etc.)\n  * External beam radiation (XRT)/external beam irradiation including protons: >= 14 days must have elapsed after local XRT; >= 150 days after TBI, craniospinal XRT or if radiation to 50% of the pelvis; >= 42 days if other substantial bone marrow (BM) radiation\n  * Radiopharmaceutical therapy (e.g., radiolabeled antibody, iobenguane I-131 [131I-MIBG]): >= 42 days must have elapsed from the last dose of systemically administered radiopharmaceutical therapy\n  * Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors: Patients must not have received prior therapy with entinostat; patients who have received therapy with other HDAC inhibitors are eligible\n* Peripheral absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >= 1000/mm^3 (within 7 days prior to enrollment)\n* Platelet count >= 100,000/mm^3 (transfusion independent, defined as not receiving platelet transfusions for at least 7 days prior to enrollment) (within 7 days prior to enrollment)\n* Hemoglobin >= 8.0 g/dl, with or without transfusion (within 7 days prior to enrollment)\n* Patients with known bone marrow metastatic disease will not be eligible\n* Creatinine clearance or radioisotope glomerular filtration rate (GFR) >= 70 ml/min/1.73 m^2 or a serum creatinine based on age/gender as follows:\n\n  * 1 to < 2 years: 0.6 mg/dL for males and females\n  * 2 to < 6 years: 0.8 mg/dL for males and females\n  * 6 to < 10 years: 1.0 mg/dL for males and females\n  * 10 to < 13 years: 1.2 mg/dL for males and females\n  * 13 to < 16 years: 1.5 mg/dL for males and 1.4 mg/dL for females\n  * > = 16 years: 1.7 mg/dL for males and 1.4 mg/dL for females (within 7 days prior to enrollment)\n* Bilirubin (sum of conjugated + conjugated) =< 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) for age (within 7 days prior to enrollment)\n* Serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) (alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) =< 3 x upper limit of normal (ULN) = 135 U/l;
