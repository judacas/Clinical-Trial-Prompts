    "official_title": "Administration of T Lymphocytes Expressing the CD30 Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) for Patients With CD30+ Nonseminomatous Germ Cell Tumors (NSGCT)",
    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Written informed consent and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) authorization for the release of personal health information explained to, understood by, and signed by the subject or legally authorized representative.\n2. Age ≥ 18 years at the time of consent.\n3. Histologically confirmed diagnosis of Nonseminomatous Germ Cell Tumors (NSGCT) of any primary site.\n4. Subjects must have received at least one prior line of therapy for their NSGCT and meet one of the following criteria. There is no maximum number of prior lines of treatment allowed.\n5. Evidence of progressive or recurrent NSGCT after prior high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) treatment, defined as meeting at least one of the following criteria: i. Tumor biopsy of new or growing or unresectable lesions demonstrating viable NSGCT. In the event of an incomplete gross resection where viable NSGCT is found, subjects will be considered eligible for the study. ii. Consecutive elevated serum tumor markers (β-HCG or AFP) are increasing. An increase of elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) alone does not constitute progressive disease. iii. Development of new or enlarging lesions in the setting of persistently elevated β-HCG or AFP, even if the β-HCG and AFP are not continuing to rise.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Subject is pregnant or lactating (Note: Breast milk cannot be stored for future use while the mother is being treated in the study).\n2. Active infection with HIV, human T-cell leukemia virus, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus (tests can be pending at the time of cell procurement; only those samples confirming lack of active infection will be used to generate transduced cells). Note: To meet eligibility subjects are required to be negative for HIV antibody, negative for HTLV1 and 2 antibodies or PCR negative for HTLV1 and 2, negative for Hepatitis B surface antigen, and negative for HCV antibody or HCV viral load.",
