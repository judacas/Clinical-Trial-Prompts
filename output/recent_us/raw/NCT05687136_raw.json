Women of childbearing potential: Barrier contraceptive method (i.e. condom) must be used in addition to one of the following methods: Intrauterine devices or hormonal contraception (oral contraceptive pills, implants, transdermal patches, vaginal rings or long-acting injections). ii. Women not of childbearing potential: Barrier contraceptive method (i.e. condom) must be used.\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)/World Health Organization (WHO) performance score of 0-1 at screening.\n* Life expectancy longer than 3 months.\n* Capable of understanding and complying with parameters as outlined in the protocol.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be FEMALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Has an active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in past 2 years (i.e., with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency) and inhaled and topical treatments are not considered a form of systemic treatment and are allowed.\n* Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy (in dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior the first dose of study drug.\n* Prior therapy:\n\n  1. Both phase I and phase Ib parts: Treated with any anti-cancer therapy within 30 days prior to the first virus injection. Anti-cancer therapy is defined as anti cancer agents (e.g. surgery, chemotherapy, immune-checkpoint inhibitors, kinase inhibitors, PARP inhibitors, biological therapies, hormonal therapies, radiation, etc.). Continuation of hormonal therapy or use of bone modifying agents (e.g. bisphosphonate or denosumab) is allowed if started at least 3 months before.\n  2. Phase Ib part: Prior oncolytic viruses, immune checkpoint inhibitors or anthracyclines (eg. doxorubicin, liposomal doxorubicin, epirubicin or any other anthracycline formulations).\n* Participants must have recovered from all Adverse Events (AE)s due to previous therapies to ≤Grade 1or baseline. Participants with ≤Grade 2 neuropathy may be eligible. Participants with endocrine-related AEs Grade ≤2 requiring treatment or hormone replacement may be eligible. If the participant had major surgery, the participant must have recovered adequately from the procedure and/or any complications from the surgery prior to starting study intervention.\n* Treated with a prior radiotherapy, including for palliative purposes, within 2 weeks of start of study treatment (before or after). Participants must have recovered from all radiation-related toxicities, not require corticosteroids, and not have had radiation pneumonitis. A 1-week washout is permitted for palliative radiation (≤2 weeks of radiotherapy) to non-Central Nervous System (CNS) disease. Palliative radiation is allowed from day 15 during the trial treatment period, if deemed necessary by the investigator.\n* Treated with a prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti PD L2 agent or with an agent directed to another stimulatory or co-inhibitory T-cell receptor (e.g., Cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated Antigen (CTLA)-4, Tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, member 4 (OX40), CD137), and was discontinued from that treatment due to a Grade 3 or higher immune-related Adverse Events (irAE).\n* Is currently participating in or has participated in a study of an investigational agent or has used an investigational device within 30 days prior to the first virus injection. An investigational agent is any drug or therapy that is currently not approved for use in humans.

Participants with basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or carcinoma in situ (e.g., breast carcinoma, cervical cancer in situ) that have undergone potentially curative therapy are not excluded.\n* Has known active CNS metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Participants with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are radiologically stable, i.e., without evidence of progression for at least 3 months by repeat imaging (note that the repeat imaging should be performed during study screening), clinically stable and without requirement of steroid treatment for at least 14 days prior to first dose of study treatment.\n* Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.\n* Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or has current pneumonitis.\n* Has a known psychiatric or substance abuse disorder that would interfere with the participant's ability to cooperate with the requirements of the study.\n* Allergy to ingredients present in the investigational medicinal products (ingredients are listed in the protocol) ie. severe hypersensitivity (≥Grade 3) to pembrolizumab and/or any of its excipients.\n* Known contraindications to pembrolizumab.\n* Has had an allogenic tissue/solid organ transplant.\n* Has received a live or live-attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of study intervention.
