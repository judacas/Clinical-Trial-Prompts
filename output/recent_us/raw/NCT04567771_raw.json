    "official_title": "Clinical Impact of a Volumetric Image Method for Confirming Tumor Coverage With Ablation on Patients With Malignant Liver Lesions (COVER-ALL)",
    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Patients presenting with â‰¤ 3 liver tumors (biopsy-proven or documented by imaging) measuring 1 to 5 cm planned to undergo percutaneous thermal ablation with either microwave or radiofrequency ablation. Patients with more than 3 tumors might also be eligible in case other tumors can be treated with another curative-intended loco-regional therapy (i.e. surgical resection, radiation therapy).\n2. Ability to completely cover the target tumor with at least a 5 mm ablation margin.\n3. Written informed consent to voluntarily participate in the study and follow-up CT scan schedule\n4. Age > 18 years-old\n5. Performance status 0-2 (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Classification [ECOG])\n6. Target tumor should be visualized on contrast-enhanced CT\n7. Adequate glomerular filtration rate\n\nExclusion Criteria\n\n1. Active bacterial infection or fungal infection on the day of the ablation that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with safe delivery of the study procedure or with the interpretation of study results.\n2. Platelet < 50,000/mm3.\n3. INR > 1.5\n4. Patients with uncorrectable coagulopathy.\n5. Currently breastfeeding or pregnant (latter confirmed by serum pregnancy test).\n6. Physical or psychological condition which would impair study participation.\n7. ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) score of > 4.\n8. Any other loco-regional therapies at the target lesion(s) within 30 days of the ablation procedure.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
