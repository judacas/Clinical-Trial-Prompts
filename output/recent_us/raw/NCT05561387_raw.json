Evidence of HIV infection d. Evidence of active tuberculosis, untreated or incompletely treated latent tuberculosis, or recent close contact with a person who has active tuberculosis e. Positive QuantiFERON-TB Gold, QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus, or T-SPOT-TB test without history of previous treatment for active or latent TB f. Indeterminate QuantiFERON-TB Gold, QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus, or T-SPOT.TB test which remains indeterminate on repeat testing, and any of the following additional required screening which indicates an increased risk of TB infection: i. History of tuberculosis exposure ii. History of travel to an area where tuberculosis is endemic iii. Findings on chest radiograph suggestive of prior exposure to tuberculosis (e.g., granulomas or apical scarring) obtained at screening or within the past 3 months iv.
