The following are exceptions to this criterion:\n\n  * Subjects with vitiligo or alopecia\n  * Subjects with hypothyroidism (e.g., following Hashimoto syndrome) stable on hormone replacement or psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment\n* A known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV 1/2 antibodies)\n* Known active hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA [qualitative] is detected). Patients with HBsAg reactive on entecavir may be eligible after consultation with hepatologist and study team.\n* Received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy\n* Active or clinically significant cardiac disease, including congestive heart failure-New York Heart Association class >II, active coronary artery disease, cardiac arrhythmias requiring antiarrhythmic therapy other than beta blockers or digoxin, unstable angina (anginal symptoms at rest), new-onset angina within 3 months before initiation, or myocardial infarction within 6 months before initiation\n* Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic pressure >140 mm Hg or diastolic pressure >90 mm Hg on repeated measurement) despite optimal medical management\n* Evidence or history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy\n* Known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial\n* Pregnant or breastfeeding or expecting to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the trial, starting with the prescreening or screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment\n* Unwilling to give written, informed consent, unwilling to participate, or unable to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study",
