Female subjects of reproductive potential who are sexually active with a male partner must:\n\n    * Have a negative serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-HCG) test within 3 days of cycle 1 day 1.\n    * Agree to use highly effective contraceptive measures (as defined in protocol) from the time of enrollment through 3 months after the last dose of study drug in the clinical trial.\n    * Female subjects are considered to be of non-reproductive potential if they: have been amenorrheic for greater than 1 year or have undergone surgical sterilization through tubal ligation, oophorectomy or hysterectomy.\n12. Male subjects with a female partner of reproductive potential must agree to use highly effective contraception (as defined in protocol) from the time of enrollment through 3 months after the last dose of study drug administration.\n13. Subjects must agree to not donate sperm or eggs (ova, oocytes) for the purpose of reproduction from the time of enrollment through 3 months after the last dose of study drug administration.\n14. Toxicities from prior anti-cancer therapy must have resolved to grade ≤ 1.\n\n    * Exceptions include vitiligo, endocrinopathies managed with hormone replacement therapy, alopecia, and grade 2 neuropathy or hearing loss.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Treatment with anticancer therapy within 14 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is shorter) of cycle 1 day 1. Palliative radiation therapy to a non-CNS metastasis is permitted if completed at least 14 days prior to cycle 1 day 1.\n2.
