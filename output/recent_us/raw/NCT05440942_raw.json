    "exclusion_criteria": "Patients meeting any of the following criteria will not be eligible for participation in the study:\n\n1.

Patient received treatment with a taxane as part of prior treatment for metastatic disease.\n3. Patient has symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastases. Patients with asymptomatic CNS metastases may participate in this study. Patient must have completed any prior local treatment for CNS metastases ≥ 28 days prior to the start of study treatment (including radiotherapy) and must be on a stable low dose of corticosteroid therapy. Radiosurgery must have been completed at least 14 days prior to start of study treatment.\n4. Patient has received wide field radiotherapy ≤ 4 weeks or limited field radiation for palliation ≤ 2 weeks prior to starting study treatment or who have adverse events which have not recovered to grade 1 or better from previous chemotherapy treatment (except alopecia, autoimmune endocrine events must be stable and controlled).\n5.

Patient has had major surgery within 14 days prior to starting study treatment or has not recovered from major side effects.\n7. Patient is currently receiving increasing or chronic treatment (>5 days) with corticosteroids or another immunosuppressive agent. The following uses of corticosteroids are permitted: single doses; standard premedication for paclitaxel, topical applications (e.g., rash), inhaled sprays (e.g., obstructive airways diseases), eye drops, or local injections (e.g., intra-articular), or < 10 mg prednisolone or equivalent.\n8.
