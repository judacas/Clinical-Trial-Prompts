Bone marrow plasma cell percentage should preferably be estimated from a core biopsy specimen; in case of a disparity between the aspirate and core biopsy, the highest value should be used ≥60% or\n      * Serum free light chain (FLC) ratio greater than or equal to 100 provided involved FLC level is 100 mg/L or higher, or\n      * More than one focal lesion on MRI*** (Each focal lesion must be 5 mm or more in size.\n* Age ≥ 70 and ineligible for autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (defined as age, ≥ 80 or age < 80 with cardiac/pulmonary/ or other comorbidities deemed by investigator likely to have a negative impact on tolerability of high dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplantation).\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 2.\n* Patients must have measurable disease defined by at least 1 of the following 3 measurements:\n\n  * Serum M-protein > 1 g/dL (10 g/L) or > 0.5 g/dL if IgA\n  * Urine M-protein > 200 mg/24 hours.\n  * Serum free light chain assay: involved free light chain level >10 mg/dL (> 100 mg/L) provided the serum free light chain ratio is abnormal\n* Due to the teratogenicity of lenalidomide and the lack of adequate reproductive toxicity data for daratumumab, if a male subject is sexually active with a woman of child bearing potential, in addition to the user independent highly effective method of contraception, a male or female condom with or without spermicide, diaphragm, or cervical cap is required. Male condom and female condom should not be used together (due to risk of failure with friction).\n* During the study (including during dose interruptions), and for 4 weeks following discontinuation of lenalidomide, and if receiving daratumumab, for 3 months after the last dose, in addition to the user independent highly effective method of contraception (even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy), a man:\n\n  1. Who is sexually active with a woman of childbearing potential must agree to use a barrier method of contraception (ie, latex or synthetic condom with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository)\n  2. Who is sexually active with a woman who is pregnant must use a latex or synthetic condom.\n  3. Must agree not to donate sperm\n* Willing and able to adhere to the prohibitions and restrictions specified in this protocol and referenced in the informed consent form (ICF)\n* Must sign an ICF (or their legally acceptable representative must sign) indicating that he or she understands the purpose of, and procedures required for, the study and is willing to participate in the study.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 70 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Peripheral neuropathy > Grade 2 or >Grade 1 with pain on clinical examination during the Screening period.\n* Kidney failure with CrCl ≤ 15 mL/min by Cockfraft Gault\n* Significant cardiac disease as determined by the investigator including:\n\n  1.

Myocardial infarction in the past 6 months\n  5. Any uncontrolled or severe cardiovascular disease\n  6. QTc > 470 milliseconds (msec) on a 12-lead ECG obtained during the Screening period. If a machine reading is above this value, the ECG should be reviewed by a qualified reader and confirmed on a subsequent ECG or by manual calculation.\n* Prior cerebrovascular event with persistent neurologic deficit.\n* Subject is:\n\n  1. Seropositive for hepatitis B (defined by a positive test for hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]). Subjects with resolved infection (ie, subjects who are HBsAg negative but positive for antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen [anti-HBc] and/or antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen [anti-HBs]) must be screened using realtime polymerase chain reaction (PCR) measurement of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA levels. Those who are PCR positive will be excluded. EXCEPTION: Subjects with serologic findings suggestive of HBV vaccination (anti-HBs positivity as the only serologic marker) AND a known history of prior HBV vaccination, do not need to be tested for HBV DNA by PCR.\n  2. Seropositive for hepatitis C (except in the setting of a sustained virologic response [SVR], defined as aviremia at least 12 weeks after completion of antiviral therapy).\n* Human immunodeficiency virus infection\n* Any medical conditions that, in the investigator's opinion, would impose excessive risk to the subject.\n* Prior or concurrent malignancy, except for the following:\n\n  1.

Note: FEV1 testing is required for subjects suspected of having chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and subjects must be excluded if FEV1 <50% of predicted normal.\n* Known moderate or severe persistent asthma within the past 2 years or currently has uncontrolled asthma of any classification. Note: Subjects who currently have controlled intermittent asthma or controlled mild persistent asthma are allowed in the study.\n* Persistent corrected serum calcium ≥ 14 mg/dL within 2 weeks of enrollment (despite appropriate measure such a short course of steroids, bisphosphonates, hydration, calcitonin).\n* Absolute neutrophil count < 1000 cells/mm3.
