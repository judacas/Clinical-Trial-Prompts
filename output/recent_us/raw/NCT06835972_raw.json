    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Signed informed consent.\n2. Participants of either gender greater than or equal to (>=) 18 years and less than or equal to (<=) 75 years of age.\n3. Participants with CD diagnosed at least 6 months prior to Screening visit in accordance with accepted clinical, endoscopic, histological and/or radiological criteria.\n4. Presence of complex perianal fistula(s) with a maximum of 2 internal openings and a maximum of 3 external openings based on clinical assessment; a central reading of a locally performed contrast enhanced (gadolinium) pelvic MRI will be performed to confirm location of the fistula and potential associated perianal abscess(es). Fistula(s) must have been draining for at least 6 weeks prior to Screening visit. Actively draining simple subcutaneous fistula(s), at the time of Screening visit, are not allowed in this study. A complex perianal fistula is defined as a fistula that meets one or more of the following criteria :\n\n   * High inter-sphincteric, high trans-sphincteric, extra-sphincteric or suprasphincteric.\n   * Presence of >=2 external openings.\n   * Associated perianal abscess(es). Note: Abscesses that are larger than 2 cm at least 2 dimensions on MRI must be confirmed to have been drained adequately by the surgeon during the preparation curettage in order to be eligible.\n5. Clinically controlled, nonactive or mildly active CD, during the last six months prior to Screening visit with:\n\n   * A patient reported outcomes (PRO-2) score <14 at Screening, AND\n   * A colonoscopy documenting the absence of ulcers larger than 0.5 cm in the colonic mucosa:\n\n     - If colonoscopy data are not available within 6 months prior to Screening:\n   * A simple endoscopic score for Crohn's Disease (SES-CD) <=6 with absence of rectal ulcers larger than 0.5 cm must be documented in a colonoscopy performed at Screening before randomization.\n\n     - If colonoscopy data are available within 6 months prior to Screening, the following must be documented, otherwise a new colonoscopy (as above) will be mandatory:\n   * The absence of ulcers larger than 0.5 cm in the colonic mucosa AND\n   * the improvement or no worsening in abdominal pain and/or in the diarrhea, sustained for one week or more, since the last colonoscopy was performed in the clinical records until Screening visit.\n\n   AND\n\n   o No hemoglobin decrease >=2.0 gram per deciliter (g/dL) or an unexplained rising C-reactive protein (CRP), > 5.0 milligram per liter (mg/L) to a concentration above the referenced upper limit of normal (ULN) (unless the rise is due to a known process other than luminal Crohn's Disease), since the last colonoscopy was performed as compared to results during the Screening visit.\n\n   AND\n\n   o no initiation or intensification of treatment with corticosteroids, immunosuppressants or monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) dose regimen since the last endoscopy up to Screening visit.\n6. Participants whose perianal fistulas were previously treated and have shown an inadequate response or a loss of response while they were receiving either an immunosuppressive agent or tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha antagonist or vedolizumab or ustekinumab, or having documented intolerance to any of these treatments administered at least at approved or recommended doses during the minimum period mentioned:\n\n   * Immunosuppressive agents: at least 3 months treatment with azathioprine (2-3 milligram per kilogram per day [mg/kg/day]), 6-mercaptopurine (1-1.5 mg/kg/day), or subcutaneous/intramuscular methotrexate (25 mg/week) prior to Screening for the study.\n   * TNFalpha antagonists:\n   * Infliximab: at least 14 weeks treatment at the approved doses for induction and/or maintenance in Crohn´s disease prior to screening for the study. For induction: 1 intravenous dose of 5 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) followed by the same dose 2 and 6 weeks after. For maintenance: 5-10 mg/kg intravenously every 8 weeks, or more frequently.\n   * Adalimumab: at least 14 weeks treatment at the approved doses for induction and/or maintenance in Crohn's disease prior to screening for the study. For induction: 1 subcutaneous dose of 160 milligram (mg), followed by 80 mg 2 weeks after. For maintenance: 40 mg subcutaneously every other week, or weekly.\n   * Certolizumab l: at least 14 weeks treatment at the approved doses for induction and/or maintenance in Crohn´s disease prior to screening for the study. For induction: 1 subcutaneous dose of 400 mg, followed by the same dose 2 and 4 weeks after. For maintenance: 400 mg subcutaneously every 2 to 4 weeks.\n   * Anti-integrin: at least 14 weeks treatment of the approved dose for induction and/or maintenance in Crohn´s disease prior to screening for the study. For induction: Vedolizumab 300 mg. For maintenance: Vedolizumab 300 mg every 4 to 8 weeks.\n   * Anti-interleukin (IL)-12/23: at least 16 weeks treatment of the approved dose in Crohn´s disease prior to screening for the study. For induction: Ustekinumab, approximately 6mg/kg intravenously initially then followed by 90 mg subcutaneously every 8 weeks.\n7. Women of childbearing potential (WCBP) must have negative serum pregnancy test at screening (sensitive to 25 international units [IU] human chorionic gonadotropin [hCG]). Both WCBP or male participants participating in this study, with a WCBP as partner, must agree to use an adequate method of contraception during the entire duration of the study.
