    "inclusion_criteria": "* Subjects must have suspected high grade glioma by MRI\n* Subjects must have received no prior therapies for this disease.\n* Patients must be considered appropriate candidates for LITT.\n* Karnofsky Performance status ≥ 60%\n* Subjects must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below. Measures of function must be within 14 days prior to registration.\n\n  * Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1500 cells/mm3, platelets ≥ 100,000 cells/mm3, hemoglobin ≥ 10.0 g/dl.

    "exclusion_criteria": "* Participants not eligible to obtain MRI with and without contrast\n* Recurrent High grade gliomas (HGG)\n* Cerebral edema, grade 3 or greater prior to surgery\n* Post-operative complications including significant neurological decline or hemorrhage that causes a drop in KPS to less than 60 or renders the patient not suitable for chemoradiation as determined by their treating physician\n* Severe co-morbidity that would confer excess risk of surgery, radiation or chemotherapy, as determined by the treating physician.\n\nAny other major medical illnesses or psychiatric impairments that in the investigator's opinion will prevent administration of completion of protocol therapy\n\n* Any other major medical illnesses or psychiatric impairments that in the investigator's opinion will prevent administration or completion of protocol therapy.\n* Pregnancy or women of childbearing potential and men who are sexually active and not willing/able to use medically acceptable forms of contraception; this exclusion is necessary because the treatment involved in this study may be significantly teratogenic.\n* Participants receiving other investigational agents.",
