Patients may be enrolled irrespective of any mutational analyses.\n5. Must have been diagnosed with any stage disease (including localized and metastatic disease) that was felt to have already been treated completely with curative-intent per investigator's, primary physician's, or research team's judgement. Curative-intent treatment strategies are unique to each tumor type and stage but includes all surgeries and perioperative therapies recommended. If patients were appropriately treated with curative intent but felt to be high-risk for relapse, they may be still be included.\n\n   o Patients diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma specifically must have Child Pugh A score at the time of screening; o Patients must have completed all definitive SOC treatment with curative intent (neoadjuvant, surgery, radiation, and adjuvant treatments) for specific tumor-type and stage per investigator's/primary physician's or research team's judgment.
