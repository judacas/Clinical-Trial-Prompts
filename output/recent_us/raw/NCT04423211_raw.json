    "inclusion_criteria": "Inclusion criteria:\n\n* Participants who are diagnosed within 5 years with SMM (per International Myeloma Working Group [IMWG] criteria), defined as serum M-protein ≥30 g/L or urinary M-protein ≥500 mg per 24 hour or both, and/or clonal bone marrow plasma cells (BMPCs) 10% to <60%, and absence of myeloma defining events or other related conditions and with high-risk SMM\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status 0 or 1 or 2\n* Capable of giving voluntary written informed consent\n* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1000/µL (1 × 10^9/L)\n* Platelets ≥50,000/µL (50 × 10^9/L)\n* Total bilirubin ≤3 mg/dL (except Gilbert syndrome, in which direct bilirubin should be -≤5 mg/dL).\n* Alanine aminotransferase ≤3× upper limit of normal (ULN), aspartate aminotransferase ≤ 3 × ULN.\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\n* Evidence of any of the following calcium, renal failure, anemia, bone lesions (CRAB) criteria or Myeloma Defining Events (SLiM CRAB) detailed below (attributable to the participants SMM involvement):\n\n  * Increased calcium levels: Corrected serum calcium >1 mg/dL above the ULN or >11 mg/dL\n  * Renal insufficiency: Determined by glomerular filtration rate (GFR) <40 mL/min/1.73 m² (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease [MDRD] Formula) or serum creatinine >2 mg/dL\n  * Anemia (hemoglobin 2 g/dL below lower limit of normal or <10 g/dL or both) transfusion support or concurrent treatment with erythropoietin stimulating agents is not permitted\n  * ≥ 1 bone lytic lesion\n  * BMPCs ≥60%\n  * Serum involved/uninvolved FLC ratio ≥100 and an involved FLC ≥100mg/L\n  * Whole body magnetic resonance imaging (WB-MRI) or positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) with more than 1 bone focal lesion (≥5 mm in diameter by MRI)\n* Primary systemic amyloid light-chain (AL) amyloidosis, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), standard risk smoldering myeloma, soft tissue plasmacytoma, symptomatic myeloma\n* Uncontrolled infection within 28 days prior to randomization in Phase 3 or first study intervention administration in safety run-in\n* Clinically significant cardiac or vascular disease within 3 months prior to randomization, e.g. Myocardial Infarction; Unstable Angina; Coronary (e.g. Coronary Artery Bypass Graft, Percutaneous Coronary Intervention) or peripheral artery revascularization, Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction <40%, Heart Failure NYHA III-IV, Stroke, Transient Ischemic Attack, Pulmonary Embolism, other thromboembolic event, cardiac arrhythmia (Grade 3 or higher by NCI-CTCAE Version 5.0)\n* Known acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related illness or known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease requiring antiviral treatment or active hepatitis A (defined as positive hepatitis A antigen or positive IgM). HIV serology at screening will be tested for German participants and any other country where required as per local regulations and serology hepatitis B and C at screening will be tested for all participants\n* Uncontrolled or active hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection: Patients with positive Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and/or HBV Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)\n\nOf note:\n\n* Patient can be eligible if anti-HBc Immunoglobulin G (IgG) positive (with or without positive anti-HBs) but HBsAg and HBV DNA are negative. If anti-HBV therapy in relation with prior infection was started before initiation of IMP, the anti-HBV therapy and monitoring should continue throughout the study treatment period.\n* Patients with negative HBsAg and positive HBV DNA observed during screening period will be evaluated by a specialist for start of anti-viral treatment: study treatment could be proposed if HBV DNA becomes negative and all the other study criteria are still met.\n* Active hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection: positive HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) and negative anti-HCV\n\nOf note:\n\n* Patients with antiviral therapy for HCV started before initiation of IMP and positive HCV antibodies are eligible. The antiviral therapy for HCV should continue throughout the treatment period until seroconversion.\n* Patients with positive anti-HCV and undetectable HCV RNA without antiviral therapy for HCV are eligible\n* Malabsorption syndrome or any condition that can significantly impact the absorption of lenalidomide\n* Any of the following within 3 months prior to randomization (or first study intervention administration in safety run-in cohort): treatment resistant peptic ulcer disease, erosive esophagitis or gastritis, infectious or inflammatory bowel disease, diverticulitis, pulmonary embolism, or other uncontrolled thromboembolic event\n* Received treatment (eg surgery, radiotherapy, medication) for a malignancy within 3 years of randomization (or first study intervention administration in safety run-in cohort)\n* Prior exposure to approved or investigational treatments for SMM or multiple myeloma (MM) (including but not limited to conventional chemotherapies, immunomodulatory imid drugs, or Proteasome inhibitors); concurrent use of bisphosphonates or receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) inhibitor denosumab is not permitted; however, prior bisphosphonates or once-a-year intravenous bisphosphonate given for the treatment of osteoporosis is permitted\n* Ongoing treatment with corticosteroids with a dose >10 mg prednisone or equivalent per day at the time of randomization (or first study intervention administration in safety run-in cohort)\n* Women of childbearing potential or male participant with women of childbearing potential who do not agree to use a highly effective method of birth control\n* Vaccination with a live vaccine 4 weeks before the start of the study drug. Seasonal flu vaccines that do not contain live virus are permitted\n\nThe above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a potential participation in a clinical trial.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
