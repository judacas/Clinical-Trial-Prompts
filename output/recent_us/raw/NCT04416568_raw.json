    "official_title": "An Open-label, Phase I, Dose Escalation, Expansion Study of MGY825 in Adult Patients With Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Signed informed consent must be obtained prior to participation in the study.\n* Dose escalation and dose expansion group 1:\n\nPatients with histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced (metastatic or unresectable) NFE2L2/KEAP1/CUL3 mutant NSCLC. Local data confirming the NFE2L2/KEAP1/CUL3 mutation status in tissue must be available for enrollment.\n\n* Dose expansion group 2:\n\nPatients with histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced (metastatic or unresectable) NSCLC irrespective of NFE2L2/KEAP1/CUL3 mutation status.\n\n* All patients:\n\nPatients must have progressed after 1 platinum-based chemotherapy regimen and PD-(L)1 antibody therapy either sequentially or concurrent with chemotherapy, where indicated, for Stage IV NSCLC.\n\nPatients treated with neo-adjuvant / adjuvant platinum-based therapy that progressed within 6 months of treatment are permitted to participate.\n\nPrior therapy with VEGF/VEGFR targeting agents is permitted. Prior treatment with approved targeted drugs (e.g., EGFRi, ALKi, METi) is mandatory in patients with NSCLC whose tumor bears actionable mutations.\n\n* Presence of at least one measurable lesion according to RECIST v1.1.\n* Patient must have a site of disease amenable to biopsy and be a candidate for tumor biopsy according to the treating institution's guidelines. Patient must be willing to undergo a new tumor biopsy at screening and during study treatment. A recent biopsy collected after the last systemic treatment and within 3 months before study entry may be submitted at screening.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 100 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Having out of range laboratory values defined as:\n\nCreatinine clearance (calculated using Cockcroft-Gault formula, or measured) < 60 mL/min Total bilirubin > 1.5 x ULN, except for patients with Gilbert's syndrome who are excluded if total bilirubin > 3.0 x ULN or direct bilirubin > 1.5 x ULN ALT > 3 x ULN AST > 3 x ULN ANC < 1.0 x 109/L Platelet count < 75 x 109/L Hemoglobin < 9 g/dL\n\n* Impaired cardiac function or clinically significant cardiac disease, including any of the following:\n\nClinically significant and/or uncontrolled heart disease such as congestive heart failure requiring treatment (NYHA Grade ≥2), uncontrolled hypertension or clinically significant arrhythmia.\n\nQTcF > 470 msec on screening ECG or congenital long QT syndrome. Acute myocardial infarction or unstable angina pectoris < 3 months prior to study entry.\n\n* Presence of symptomatic CNS metastases, or CNS metastases that require local CNS-directed therapy (such as radiotherapy or surgery) or increasing doses of corticosteroids within 2 weeks prior to study entry. Patients with treated symptomatic brain metastases should be neurologically stable (for 4 weeks post-treatment and prior to study entry) and at a dose of ≤ 10 mg per day prednisone or equivalent for at least 2 weeks before administration of any study treatment.\n* Known active COVID-19 infection.\n* Unable or unwilling to swallow capsules as per dosing schedule. Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.",
