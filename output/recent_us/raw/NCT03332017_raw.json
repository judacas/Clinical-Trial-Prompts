    "official_title": "A Phase I Pilot Study of Abaloparatide + Bevacizumab in Myelodysplastic Syndromes",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Age equal to or greater than 18\n* Patients must have a documented diagnosis of MDS or non-proliferative chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) (WBC < 12,000/mcL) according to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria (27)\n* Patients can be treatment-naïve or have received prior MDS-directed chemotherapy.\n\n  * Treatment-naïve MDS patients (or those previously treated with growth factors alone) must have Revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R) categories of Very Low-, Low- or Intermediate-risk disease (see Appendix A for Revised International Prognostic Scoring System for MDS).\n  * MDS patients previously treated with disease-modifying chemotherapy (i.e. azacitidine, decitabine, lenalidomide, intensive chemotherapy, and/or an investigational agent) are eligible irrespective of IPSS-R score.\n* Patients must be off all non-transfusion therapy for MDS for 28 days prior to initiation of study treatment, including all types of growth factors.\n* Bone marrow biopsy (BMBx) within 30 days prior to first study treatment.\n* Cytopenia involving at least one cell line such as anemia, thrombocytopenia or leukopenia at the time of study enrollment. Cytopenias should be present on at least 2 different blood draws within 8 weeks of study enrollment. Definitions of cytopenias for the purposes of this study are as follows:\n\n  * Anemia: Patients must be symptomatic in the opinion of the treating physician with a hemoglobin ≤ 10.0 g/dL\n  * Thrombocytopenia: Platelet count < 100,000/microliter\n  * Neutropenia: Absolute neutrophil count < 1000/microliter\n* ECOG Performance Status 0-2\n* Adequate organ function as evidenced by:\n\n  * Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤2.5 × the upper limit of normal (ULN).\n  * Total bilirubin ≤2 mg/dL\n  * Serum creatinine <2 mg/dL, or creatinine clearance (calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault formula) ≤1.5 × ULN.\n* Urine dipstick for proteinuria < 2+. Patients discovered to have ≥ 2+ proteinuria on dipstick urinalysis at baseline should undergo a 24 hour urine collection and must demonstrate ≤ 1 g of protein in 24 hours\n* International normalised ratio (INR) ≤1.5 and prothrombin time (PT) ≤ 1.5 x ULN\n* Women with an intact uterus (unless amenorrheic for the last 24 months) must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 30 days prior to enrollment into the study.\n* Females of childbearing potential and sexually active males must use effective contraception during the trial and for 6 months after the last dose of bevacizumab.\n* Written informed consent.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Bone marrow blasts equal to or greater than 20%\n* Patients actively receiving either abaloparatide, teriparatide or bisphosphonate therapy for other indications\n* Cumulative prior use of abaloparatide and/or any other parathyroid hormone analogs for > 20 months\n* History of allogeneic stem cell transplant\n* Pregnant or breast feeding female subjects\n* Platelets < 50,000/mm3\n* Major surgery (including open biopsy), significant traumatic injury within 28 days prior to enrollment or anticipation of the need for major surgery during study treatment\n* Prior malignancy (excluding localized cervical carcinoma or cutaneous basal cell/squamous cell carcinoma) unless in remission for at least 2 years.\n* Concurrent malignancy (excluding localized cervical carcinoma or cutaneous basal cell/squamous cell carcinoma)\n* Need for aspirin at a dose of ≥ 325 mg/day; if aspirin can be safely stopped or dose dropped to < 325 mg/day ≥ 10 days before the first dose of bevacizumab, then patient will remain eligible\n* Uncontrolled hypertension (blood pressures: systolic > 150 mmHg and/or diastolic > 100 mmHg)\n* Clinically significant cardiovascular disease present ≤6 months before enrollment as judged by the treating physician. Examples include:\n\n  1. Myocardial infarction\n  2. Unstable angina\n  3. Congestive heart failure NYHA Class ≥ II\n  4. Serious cardiac arrhythmia\n  5. Cerebrovascular accident and/or transient ischemic attack\n  6. Severe peripheral vascular disease (ischemic rest pain, non-healing wound or ulcer, or tissue loss)\n* Pulmonary embolus, deep venous thrombosis, or arterial thrombosis currently requiring anticoagulation\n* < 10 days since prior anticoagulants\n* Non-healing wound, active peptic ulcer or bone fracture\n* History of abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation or intra-abdominal abscess within 6 months of enrollment\n* Clinically significant hemorrhagic illness within the past 3 weeks\n* History of osteosarcoma\n* History of hyperparathyroidism\n* Elevated (>ULN) serum calcium level\n* Patients at increased risk for osteosarcoma, including those with Paget's disease of bone, unexplained elevations of alkaline phosphatase, and/or prior external beam or implant radiation therapy involving the skeleton.\n* Psychiatric illness or social situation that would preclude study compliance\n* Patients unable to give informed consent or to be followed up adequately\n* Known hypersensitivity to a product from Chinese Hamster Ovary mammalian cell or to a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody\n* Other investigational treatments within 28 days of the start of study therapy",
