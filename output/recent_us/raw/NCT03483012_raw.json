    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Patients must have a gynecologic malignancy or breast cancer (triple negative or hormone receptor positive only) that is refractory/intolerant to all therapies known to confer clinical benefit in the advanced or metastatic setting or if the patient's clinical team and the PI believe that the study treatment gives the patient the best chance for clinical benefit\n2. Patients with breast cancer must have measurable disease per RECIST 1.1. criteria. Patients with ovarian cancer are eligible with or without measurable disease\n3. Patients with ovarian cancer must have had appropriate surgical management for their disease and should be platinum resistant (recurrence within 6 months of last platinum-containing regimen) or be refractory to platinum-containing regimens\n4. Patients with endometrial, cervical, or any other advanced gynecologic malignancy must have already received or not be a candidate for all therapy proven to have a survival benefit\n5. Patients must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of ≤2\n6. Patients must be ≥18 years of age\n7. Patients must have adequate organ function, defined as follows:\n\n   * Absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/µL\n   * Platelets ≥125,000/µL\n   * Hemoglobin ≥10 g/dL\n   * Serum creatinine ≤1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) or calculated creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min using the Cockcroft-Gault equation\n   * Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN OR direct bilirubin ≤1 x ULN\n   * Aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase ≤2.5 x ULN unless liver metastases are present, in which case they must be ≤5 x ULN\n8. Patient agrees to blood draws during screening and at the end of treatment for molecular and cytogenetic analysis\n9. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test (beta hCG) at Screening\n10. Female patients of childbearing potential must agree to use an acceptable method of birth control (excluding hormonal birth control methods, see Section 3.0.5) for 72 hours prior to initiation of therapy and to continue its use during the study and for at least 180 days after the final dose\n11. Male patients must agree to use an acceptable form of birth control (see Section 3.0.5) from study Day 1 through at least 180 days after the final dose\n12. Patients must be able to understand the study procedures and agree to participate in the study by providing written informed consent\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Patients with HER2+ breast cancer measured by standard IHC or FISH testing\n2. Patients must not be simultaneously enrolled in any other interventional clinical trial\n3. Patients must not have had major surgery ≤3 weeks of starting the study and patient must have recovered from any effects of any major surgery\n4. Patients must not have had investigational therapy administered ≤4 weeks, or within a time interval less than at least 5 half-lives of the investigational agent, whichever is longer, prior to the first scheduled day of dosing in this study\n5. Patients must not have had radiotherapy encompassing >20% of the bone marrow\n6. Patients must not have received prior treatment with a known PARP inhibitor or have participated in a study where any treatment arm included administration of a known PARP inhibitor\n7. Patients must not have a known hypersensitivity to the components of niraparib, everolimus, rapamycin analogues, or the excipients\n8. Patients must not be immunocompromised (patients with splenectomy are allowed)\n9. Patients must not have had any known, persistent >Grade 2 toxicity from prior cancer therapy\n10. Patients must not have had any known, persistent (>4 weeks), ≥Grade 3 hematological toxicity or fatigue from prior cancer therapy\n11. Patients must not have received a transfusion (platelets or red blood cells) ≤4 weeks of the first dose of study treatment\n12. Patients must not have current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality (including active or uncontrolled myelosuppression [ie, anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia]) that might confound the results of the study or interfere with the patient's participation for the full duration of the study treatment or that makes it not in the best interest of the patient to participate\n13. Patients must not have had diagnosis, detection, or treatment of another type of cancer ≤2 years prior to randomization (except basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that has been definitively treated)\n14. Patients must not have known, symptomatic brain or leptomeningeal metastases\n15. Patients must not be considered a poor medical risk due to a serious, uncontrolled medical disorder, nonmalignant systemic disease, or active, uncontrolled infection. Examples include, but are not limited to, uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia, recent (within 90 days) myocardial infarction, uncontrolled major seizure disorder, unstable spinal cord compression, superior vena cava syndrome, interstitial lung disease, HIV or Hepatitis B, or any psychiatric disorder that prohibits obtaining informed consent\n16. Patients must not have any known history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML)\n17. Patient is a woman with a positive serum pregnancy test ≤3 days prior to study drug administration, is breast-feeding, or is planning to conceive children within the projected duration of the study treatment\n18. Patients with uncontrolled or poorly controlled hypertension\n19. Patients taking ACE inhibitors (patients that have no known medical reason to require therapy with ACE inhibitors may be switched to another appropriate antihypertensive treatment prior to initiation of study treatment)\n20. Patients taking strong or moderate CYP3A4/PgP inhibitors or strong CYP3A4/PgP inducers (appendix 2) (if medically appropriate, patients may be switched to another appropriate therapy at least 14 days prior to initiation of study treatment)",
