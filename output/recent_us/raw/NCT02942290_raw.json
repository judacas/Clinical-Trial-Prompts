    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Individuals involved in the conduct of the trial, their employees, or immediate family members of such individuals.\n2. Any clinically significant medical condition or physical/laboratory/ECG/vital signs abnormality that would, in the opinion of the investigator, put the participant at undue risk or interfere with the evaluation of the IP or interpretation of trial results.\n3. History of allergy, hypersensitivity reaction, or anaphylaxis to any component of the IP or to a previous monoclonal antibody (mAb) or human immunoglobulin (Ig) therapy.\n4. Participant has had excessive sun exposure, is planning a trip to a sunny climate, or has used tanning booths within 4 weeks prior to Day 1 or is not willing to minimize natural and artificial sunlight exposure during the trial. Use of sunscreen products and protective apparel are recommended when sun exposure cannot be avoided.\n5. Known history of a primary immunodeficiency or an underlying condition such as known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, a positive result for HIV infection, splenectomy, or any underlying condition that in the opinion of the investigator significantly predisposes the participant to infection.\n6.

Positive test for hepatitis C virus antibody.\n8. Active tuberculosis (TB), or a positive TB test at Screening. Participant will be evaluated for latent TB infection with a purified protein derivative (PPD) test or a QuantiFERON-TB Gold test. Participants who demonstrate evidence of latent TB infection (either PPD ≥5 mm of induration or positive QuantiFERON-TB Gold test, irrespective of bacille Calmette-Guérin vaccination status will not be allowed to participate in the trial, unless documented history of appropriate treatment for active or latent TB. Participants with an indeterminate test result can repeat the test, but if the repeat test is also indeterminate, they are excluded.\n9. Any severe herpes virus family infection (including Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus [CMV]) at any time prior to Day 1, including, but not limited to, disseminated herpes, herpes encephalitis, recent recurrent herpes zoster (defined as 2 episodes within the last 2 years), or ophthalmic herpes.\n10. Any herpes zoster, CMV, or Epstein-Barr virus infection that was not completely resolved 12 weeks prior to Day 1.\n11. Any of the following within 30 days prior to signing the ICF and though Day 1:\n\n    * Clinically significant active infection in the opinion of the investigator, including ongoing, and chronic infection requiring antibiotics or antiviral medication (chronic nail infections are allowed).

History of clinically significant cardiac disease including unstable angina; myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to Day 1; congestive heart failure; arrhythmia requiring active therapy, except for clinically insignificant extra systoles, or minor conduction abnormalities; or presence of clinically significant abnormality on ECG if, in the opinion of the investigator, it would increase the risk of trial participation.\n15. History of cancer or lymphoproliferative disease within 5 years prior to Day 1, except as follows:\n\n    * In situ carcinoma of the cervix treated with apparent success with curative therapy > 12 months prior to Screening, or\n    * Nonmetastatic cutaneous basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin treated with apparent success with curative therapy.\n16. Active forms of other inflammatory skin disease(s) or evidence of other skin conditions (eg, psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis, lupus) at the time of the Screening and through Day 1, that in the opinion of the investigator might interfere with evaluation of AA and the assessment of the activity measures.\n17. Presence of another form of alopecia (except for androgenic alopecia).\n18. History of male or female pattern hair loss > Hamilton stage III or > Ludwig stage II.\n19. History or presence of hair transplants.\n20. History or presence of micropigmentation of the scalp (Note: microblading of the eyebrows is permitted).\n21.
