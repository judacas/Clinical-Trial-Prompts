Documentation of HER2/neu status. Patients who are HER2/neu-positive must be treated with a HER2/neu inhibitor, and subjects should have progressed on or be intolerant to the targeted therapy or subjects must have received other chemotherapy regimen if HER2/neu inhibitor was contraindicated or another available approved targeted agent unless the targeted agent was contraindicated. At time of enrolment, patients must have progressed on, be intolerant of, or be ineligible for, all available standard of care therapies with proven benefit.\n\n   iv. Subjects must/should have received no more than 3 lines of prior therapy for the advanced disease (if a subject progressed within 6 months of completing adjuvant therapy, this would count as a prior line of therapy).\n5. For patients enrolled in Substudy 3 or cohort 3 and 4, if a taxane (i.e., paclitaxel or docetaxel) was administered as part of the previous regimen, PD must have occurred > 12 months from the end of the previous treatment. (Patients who received a taxane in previous treatments without reaching PD may enroll without the 12-month waiting period.)\n6. Patients enrolled in Dose Expansion only, patient must have undergone a minimum of 1 prior systemic regimen for advanced or metastatic disease. (Korea only, patients must have received the second line standard of care treatment as per the regulations of the respective country. Patients who are unsuitable to receive the standard of care second line treatment will be eligible for enrollment)\n7. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) 0or-1\n8. For patients enrolled from DL1.4 of Substudy 1 onwards and for all patients in Substudies 2 and 3 and all four dose expansion cohorts, measurable tumor disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 criteria (RECIST 1.1), i.e., a minimum of one target lesion.\n9.

Hydroxyurea may be used for up to 28 days in the initial treatment cycle if needed, to keep the white blood cell (WBC) count ≤25,000/µL. However, no other anti-leukemic treatments, apart from the study drug, are allowed during this period.\n   3. Leukapheresis is allowed to maintain blast count ≤25,000/µL\n8. Adequate organ functions as indicated by the following Screening visit local laboratory values:\n\n   1.
