Adequate organ function during screening evaluation\n9. Available pancreatic adenocarcinoma tissue samples from a primary or metastatic site that has been biopsied within the last 12 months and provide consent for them to be obtained and analyzed by the study sponsor to assist in determining final eligibility.

    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Any prior neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy for pancreatic cancer within 6 months of screening.\n2. Any prior therapy for metastatic pancreatic cancer or locally advanced and unresectable pancreatic cancer (except for neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy as noted above in exclusion criteria 1)\n3. Known cerebral metastasis.\n4. Diagnosis of another malignancy within the past 2 years (excluding a history of carcinoma in situ of the cervix, superficial non-melanoma skin cancer, or superficial bladder cancer that has been adequately treated, or stage 1 prostate cancer that does not require treatment or requires only treatment with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists or antagonists if initiated at least 30 days prior to beginning the NEAAR medical food).\n5. Body mass index (BMI) <18.5 kg/m2 or >40 kg/m2 or serious or refractive cachexia or anorexia that, in the investigator's judgment, prohibits subjects from having energy or appetite sufficient to reliably engage in a strict medical food regimen for an extended time.\n6. Presence of any significant comorbidity including clinically significant cardiac disease (e.g., congestive heart failure, symptomatic coronary artery disease and cardiac arrhythmias not well controlled with medication), myocardial infarction or unstable angina within the 12 months prior to screening, or any major organ failure.\n7. Known hypersensitivity, allergy, or religious restrictions regarding pork or pork-derived products; or known allergy to any of the major food allergens as defined by U.S. law (milk, eggs, fish, Crustacean shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat, soybeans and sesame); or known allergy or hypersensitivity to , gemcitabine or nab-paclitaxel, PERT products (e.g., Pancreaze), or formulary excipients in these products (refer to the FDA-approved package insert).\n8. Major surgery or significant traumatic injury within 14 days of planned start of NEAAR medical food or the anticipation of the need for a major surgical procedure during the study.\n9. Unwillingness to consume small quantities of meat products and byproducts (e.g., fish sauce, bone marrow, chicken broth).\n10. Diagnosed with an eating disorder, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, or gluten-sensitive enteropathy.",
