    "inclusion_criteria": "Female\n\n1. Able to understand the investigational nature of this study and provide written informed consent prior to the participation in the trial\n2. Age 18 to 49, inclusive\n3. Diagnosis of Stage I, II, or III HR+, HER2-negative breast cancer (ER>1% and/or, PR>1%, HER2-negative per ASCO CAP guidelines)\n4. Is a candidate for endocrine therapy + ovarian suppression LH > 4 IU/L within 28 days prior to Day 1\n5. Is premenopausal as defined by:\n\n   * E2 > 30 pg/mL\n   * follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) < 40 IU/L\n   * regular menses (eg, menstrual cycle length of 21 to 35 days) Note: premenopausal status must be determined before neo/adjuvant chemotherapy in patients for which it is planned or prior to Day 1 in patients who did not have prior chemotherapy. If premenopausal status was not determined prior to chemotherapy, E2 and FSH must meet the above criteria when measured 2 weeks or more after the end of the final cycle of chemotherapy.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 49 Years",
