(For cohort B) Clinical or radiologic primary tumor size of at least 1.5 cm prior to enrollment onto protocol 2014-0185 (ARTEMIS). Primary tumor of at least 1.0 cm or evidence of continued lymph node involvement by imaging (ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) after adriamycin-based neoadjuvant therapy\n* (For cohort B): Primary tumor sample collected before NACT started (on ARTEMIS) and underwent molecular testing for integral biomarkers including immunohistochemical assessment of FRalpha\n* (For cohort A): No limit on prior therapies for metastatic disease. (Relapse of disease within 6 months of adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy is considered 1 line of therapy for metastatic disease). (For cohort B): received at least one dose of an anthracycline-based NACT. Patients are eligible if therapy was discontinued due to disease progression or therapy intolerance. Patients with disease progression on anthracycline-based therapy should be evaluated by the surgical team. If the patient is deemed inoperable at the time of evaluation, the patient may continue to undergo protocol therapy with a goal of reduction in tumor size to become operable. If the patient is deemed at high risk of becoming inoperable by the surgical team based upon tumor size or location, the patient will be considered ineligible for study and will be recommended to go to surgery\n* (For cohort B): Primary tumor size of at least 1.0 cm by imaging (ultrasound or MRI) or evidence of continued lymph node involvement by imaging (ultrasound or MRI) after adriamycin-based neoadjuvant therapy\n* (For cohort B): Baseline multigated acquisition (MUGA) or echocardiogram showing left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) >= 50% within 6 weeks prior to initiation of NACT\n* (For both cohorts A and B): Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >= 1.5 x 10^9/L\n* (For both cohorts A and B): Platelets >= 100 x 10^9/L\n* (For both cohorts A and B): Hemoglobin (Hb) > 9 G/dL\n* (For both cohorts A and B): Total serum bilirubin =< 2.0 mg/dL\n* (For both cohorts A and B): Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) =< 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) (=< 5 x ULN in patients with liver metastases)\n* (For both cohorts A and B): International normalized ratio (INR) =< 2\n* (For both cohorts A and B): Serum creatinine =< 1.5 x ULN\n* (For both cohorts A and B): Serum albumin > 2\n* Signed informed consent obtained prior to any screening procedures\n* (For cohort A only): Time from prior therapy: a. Systemic anti-neoplastic therapy: five half-lives or four weeks, whichever is shorter. Hormonal therapy is not considered anti-neoplastic therapy. b. Radiotherapy: wide-field radiotherapy (e.g. > 30% of marrow-bearing bones) completed at least four weeks, or focal radiation completed at least two weeks, prior to starting study treatment\n* (For cohort B only): Patients must have at least 3 and no more than 5 weeks between anthracycline-based therapy and start of treatment with mirvetuximab soravtansine\n* (For both cohorts A and B): Patients must have resolution of toxic effect(s) of the most recent prior chemotherapy to grade 1 or less (except alopecia)\n* (For both cohorts A and B): Women of child-hearing potential (WCBP) must have a negative pregnancy test within 3 days prior to the first dose of study treatment\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Pregnant or lactating women\n* Patients with a history of non-compliance to medical regimens or who are considered potentially unreliable or will not be able to complete the entire study\n* (For Cohort B only): Presence of metastatic disease or prior radiation therapy of the primary breast carcinoma or axillary lymph nodes\n* Women of child-bearing potential (WCBP), defined as all women capable of becoming pregnant, won't use highly effective methods of contraception during the study and 12 weeks after.

In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of childbearing potential\n* Male patients whose sexual partner(s) are WCBP who are not willing to use adequate contraception, during the study and for 12 weeks after the end of treatment\n* Patients with > grade 1 peripheral neuropathy\n* Active or chronic corneal disorder, including but not limited to the following: Sjogren's syndrome, Fuchs corneal dystrophy (requiring treatment), history of corneal transplantation, active herpetic keratitis, and also active ocular conditions requiring on-going treatment/monitoring such as wet age-related macular degeneration requiring intravitreal injections, active diabetic retinopathy with macular edema, presence of papilledema, and acquired monocular vision\n* Serious concurrent illness or clinically-relevant active infection, including, but not limited to the following:\n\n  * Known active hepatitis B or C\n  * Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection\n  * Varicella-zoster virus (shingles)\n  * Cytomegalovirus infection\n  * Any other known concurrent infectious disease, requiring IV antibiotics within 2 weeks of study enrollment\n* Clinically-significant cardiac disease:\n\n  * Recent myocardial infarction (=< 6 months prior to day 1)\n  * Unstable angina pectoris\n  * Uncontrolled congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association > class II)\n  * Uncontrolled hypertension (>= Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] version [v]4.03 grade 3)\n  * Prior history of hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy\n  * Uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmias\n  * Clinically-significant vascular disease (e.g. aortic aneurysm, or dissecting aneurysm)\n  * Severe aortic stenosis\n  * Clinically significant peripheral vascular disease\n  * >= Grade 3 cardiac toxicity following prior chemotherapy\n  * Corrected QT interval (QTc) > 470 for females and > 450 for males\n* History of neurological conditions that would confound assessment of treatment-emergent neuropathy\n* History of hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke within the last 6 months\n* History of cirrhotic liver disease\n* Previous clinical diagnosis of non-infectious pneumonitis or non-infectious interstitial lung disease\n* Prior hypersensitivity to monoclonal antibodies\n* Patients who have a history of another primary malignancy, with the exceptions of: non-melanoma skin cancer, and carcinoma in situ of the cervix, uteri, or breast from which the patient has been disease free for >= 3 years\n* Carcinomatous meningitis, untreated central nervous system (CNS) disease or symptomatic CNS metastasis.
