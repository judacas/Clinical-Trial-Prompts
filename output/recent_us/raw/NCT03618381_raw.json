    "exclusion_criteria": "* Post-ASCT anti-lymphoma or investigational therapy; immediate post-ASCT consolidative radiation therapy is allowed as long as it occurs prior to initiation of study therapy; baseline imaging and pulmonary function tests (PFTs) must be performed after completion of radiation\n* Previous allogeneic transplant\n* Total carmustine (BCNU) dose of > 600 mg/m^2 with prior treatments including transplant conditioning regimen\n* Live vaccine within 30 days prior to day 1 of protocol therapy (e.g. measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus Calmette-Guerin [BCG], oral polio vaccine, and oral typhoid)\n* Refractory to prior brentuximab vedotin (i.e. progression while on treatment)\n* Refractory to prior anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agent\n* History of prior >= grade 3 hypersensitivity to either brentuximab vedotin or nivolumab\n* History of another primary malignancy that has not been in remission for at least 3 years; exceptions include:\n\n  * Basal cell carcinoma of the skin or\n  * Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or\n  * In situ cervical cancer\n* Known active central nervous system (CNS) involvement by lymphoma, including parenchymal and/or lymphomatous meningitis\n* History of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)\n* Grade >= 2 peripheral neuropathy at the present time\n* Prior diagnosis of inherited or acquired immunodeficiency\n* Condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (> 10 mg daily prednisone or equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study drug administration; exceptions are:\n\n  * Inhaled or topical steroids and\n  * Adrenal replacement doses > 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents in the absence of active autoimmune disease\n* Uncontrolled illness including ongoing or active infection\n* History of or active pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease:\n\n  * For history of pneumonitis to be an exclusion, patient had to have required supplemental oxygen or corticosteroid treatment; radiographic changes alone are not an exclusion\n* An active, known or suspected autoimmune disease; the following are exceptions:\n\n  * Vitiligo\n  * Hemolytic anemia associated with the lymphoma (history of or at the present time)\n  * Type I diabetes mellitus\n  * Residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only requiring hormone replacement\n  * Psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, or\n  * Conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger\n* Active or known history (standard pre-ASCT assessments) of:\n\n  * Hepatitis B or C infection\n  * Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\n  * Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)\n* Women who are pregnant or lactating\n* History of a cerebral vascular event (stroke or transient ischemic attack), unstable angina, myocardial infarction, or cardiac symptoms consistent with New York Heart Association Class III-IV within 6 months prior to day 1 of protocol therapy\n* History or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator\n* Prospective participants who, in the opinion of the investigator, may not be able to comply with all study procedures (including compliance issues related to feasibility/logistics)",
