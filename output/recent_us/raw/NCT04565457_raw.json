Female must also have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test ≤ 7 days before initial treatment.\n\n   1. Highly effective birth control (failure rate of less than 1%), e.g. intrauterine device (IUD), intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS), bilateral tubal occlusion, vasectomized partner and sexual abstinence. Females using hormonal contraception should use barrier methods in addition.\n   2. Male patients with a female partner of childbearing potential are eligible if vasectomized or if they agree to the use of barrier contraception with other methods described above during the study treatment period and for ≥ 90 days after the last dose of zanubrutinib.\n9. For patients with Infectious disease, must have:\n\n   1. HIV positive with negative viral load and CD4 count > 400\n   2. Non-viremic Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)\n   3. HBcAb (Hepatitis B core positive) and HBsAg negative\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Serious uncontrolled concurrent illness or comorbid condition\n2. Other active systemic malignancy except for basal cell carcinoma of the skin, cervical carcinoma in situ or very low and low risk prostate cancer under observation. Patients with a remote history (3 years or more) of malignancy are eligible for the protocol in the absence of active disease\n3. Concurrent chronic systemic immune therapy, targeted therapy not indicated in this study protocol\n4. Unable to comprehend the study requirements or who are not likely to comply with the study protocol\n5. Prior participation in chemotherapy, cytotoxic therapy, immunotherapy, radiation therapy or therapeutic protocols within 2 weeks of protocol treatment\n6. Pregnant (confirmed by serum or urine β-HCG) or lactating\n7. Transaminases > 3 times above the upper limits of the institutional normal\n8. Patients must not have pre-existing immunosuppression, concurrent immunosuppressive treatment with the exception of dexamethasone, or low dose prednisone with a total dose equivalent to 15 mg of prednisone a day or less for chronic conditions. Allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients as well as other organ transplant recipients are excluded. Autologous stem cell transplant recipients will qualify if relapse occurs at one year after the stem cell transplantation. Short course of dexamethasone up to 40 mg orally or intravenously daily with or without taper for CNS lymphoma symptom control is allowed.\n9. Patients should not have active and/or ongoing autoimmune anemia and/or autoimmune thrombocytopenia (e.g., idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura).\n10. Non-healing wound, ulcer or bone fracture\n11. Known bleeding diathesis (e.g., von Willebrand's disease) or hemophilia\n12. Cerebrovascular accident or intracranial hemorrhage within 6 months of the study treatment; arterial or venous thrombotic or embolic event such as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism within 3 months before the start of study treatment. Patients with upper extremity catheter-related deep venous thrombosis will not be excluded.\n13. Concurrent use of warfarin or other vitamin K antagonists (need to be stopped 7 days prior to starting on trial drug)\n14. Infectious disease: HIV positive patients with positive viral load and CD4+ count < 400 are excluded;\n\n    1. HIV patients must have established and consistent infectious disease specialist care. HIV positive patients have to agree for every 12-week monitoring of viral load. Patients with the emergence of HIV viral load on the trial treatment will be referred to the infectious disease specialist and can continue on the trial treatment unless recommended to stop by the infectious disease specialist and PI. If the viral load reaches 100,000 copies per milliliter or above, the patient would be referred to an infectious disease specialist for and evaluation and would be taken off the trial.\n    2. Patients with presence of HCV antibody are eligible if HCV RNA is undetectable and if they are willing to undergo monitoring for HCV reactivation every 12 weeks. HCV patients will be taken off trial if there is 1 log increase in viral load after the initial detection of HCV viral load regardless of liver function tests (LFTs). Patients will be referred promptly to hepatology specialist with the first detectable viral load.\n    3. Patients with detectable hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) are excluded. Patients with viral hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) positivity, but absence of HBsAg, are eligible if HBV DNA is undetectable and if they are willing to undergo monitoring for Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) reactivation every 12 weeks. HBV patients will be taken off trial if there is 1 log increase in viral load after the initial detection of HBV viral load regardless of LFTs. Patients will be referred promptly to hepatology specialist with the first detectable viral load.\n15. Currently active, clinically significant cardiovascular disease including the following:\n\n    1. Myocardial infarction within 6 months before screening\n    2. Unstable angina within 3 months before screening\n    3. New York Heart Association class III or IV congestive heart failure\n    4.

Any uncontrolled active systemic infection or infection requiring systemic treatment that was completed ≤ 7 days before the first dose of therapy\n17. Participants who received a strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A inhibitor or inducer within 7 days prior to the first dose of protocol anti-fungal prophylaxis, or participants who require continuous treatment with a strong CYP3A inhibitor/inducer (i.e., except for any medication to be specifically mentioned in this protocol)\n18. Any life-threatening illness, medical condition, or organ system dysfunction that, in the investigator's opinion, could compromise the patient's safety, or put the study at undue risk. Participants with suspicious radiologic evidence of aspergillosis infection (i.e., chest CT and/or brain MRI) will not be eligible unless confirmatory laboratory testing of Beta-D glucan and aspergillus antigen are negative\n19. Prior treatment with pemetrexed or a Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor for lymphoma\n20. Vaccination with a live or attenuates vaccine within 28 days prior to the first dose of zanubrutinib. Live or attenuated vaccines are not allowed during treatment with zanubrutinib\n21. Hypersensitivity to zanubrutinib or pemetrexed or any of the other ingredients of the applicable study drug",
