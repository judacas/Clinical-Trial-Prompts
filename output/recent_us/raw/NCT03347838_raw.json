Active disease at screening visit\n5. At least 1 of the following parameters in at least one eye:\n\n   * active inflammatory chorioretinal and/or inflammatory retinal vascular lesions\n   * ≥ 1+ vitreous haze (Nussenblatt criteria)\n   * ≥ 2+ anterior chamber cells (National Eye Institute/Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature criteria)\n   * Cystoid macular edema, seen on optical coherence tomography and/or fluorescein angiography\n   * FA leakage pattern deemed by investigators to be suggestive of active intermediate, posterior, and panuveitis, including optic disc, retinal vascular, and macular leakages\n   * Active snowbanking\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
