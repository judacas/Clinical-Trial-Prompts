Then, and at any time after the initiation of therapy: Loss of CHR or loss of CCyR, new mutations, confirmed loss of MMR (In 2 consecutive tests, of which one with a BCR-ABL1 transcripts level ≥1%), clonal chromosome abnormalities in Ph+ cells (CCA/Ph+)\n\n     b) For CML AP patients: the patients must meet at least one criterion as follows:\n\n     i.)

At any time after the initiation of therapy, the development of new BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations in the absence of a MaHR\n\n     c) For CML BP and Ph+ ALL patients: the patients must meet at least one criterion as follows:\n\n     i) One month after the initiation of therapy: failure to achieve a MaHR\n\n     ii) At any time after the initiation of therapy, the loss of a MaHR, confirmed in at least 2 consecutive analyses separated by at least 1 week\n\n     iii) At any time after the initiation of therapy, the development of new BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations in the absence of a MaHR\n  3. Intolerance to TKIs is defined as:\n\n     1.
