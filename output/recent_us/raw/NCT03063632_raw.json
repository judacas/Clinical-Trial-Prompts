The quality and quantity of the sample must be confirmed sufficient as per the Study Laboratory Manual. Participants who do not have archival tissue must agree to a new biopsy to obtain fresh tumor tissue prior to dosing.\n* Part 1b (PK/PDy cohort): The participant must have lesions amenable for biopsy and agree to undergo biopsies for fresh tumor tissue prior to treatment, approximately 4 to 6 weeks after treatment, and, whenever possible, at the time of PD and /or end of treatment (EOT).
