PD-L1 expression criteria (testing by 22C3, SP142, or SP263) for Monotherapy dose escalation and expansion: TPS/TC ≥ 50% or IC ≥ 10%. Patients with PD-L1 TPS/TC<50% or IC<10% expression may be included with agreement of Sponsor\n6. PD-L1 expression criteria for Combination dose escalation arms:\n\n   1. IMU-201 + atezolizumab, TPS/TC ≥ 50% or IC ≥ 10%\n   2. IMU-201 + atezolizumab + chemotherapy, independent of PD-L1 expression\n7.

IMU-201 + atezolizumab + chemotherapy, independent of PD-L1 expression\n8. Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks in the opinion of the Investigator\n9. Zubrod/ECOG score performance status 0-1\n10. At least one measurable lesion as defined by RECIST 1.1 criteria.\n11. Adequate hematologic, liver, and renal function\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Prior therapy for advanced NSCLC within 3 weeks prior to Day 1;\n2. Continuous systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (> 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications within 2 weeks prior to first dose of study treatment.;\n3. Any previous grade 3 or higher toxicity to a PD-1 inhibitor or PD-L1 inhibitor;\n4. Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease that required treatment with immunosuppressive agents or has current pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease;\n5. Known brain metastases requiring steroid treatment, or signs and symptoms indicating suspected brain metastases;\n6. Current or previous history of auto-immune disease;\n7. NSCLC expressing epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), B-Raf proto-oncogene (BRAF) or ROS proto-oncogene 1 (ROS1) mutations who have not received appropriate therapies targeting these mutations and progress (if treatments are not available, patients who have NOT received appropriate therapies may be enrolled);\n8. Prior organ transplant;\n9. Concurrent active malignancy except for adequately controlled limited basal cell carcinoma of the skin;\n10. History of uncontrolled seizures, central nervous disorders, or psychiatric disability judged by the Investigator to be clinically significant and precluding informed consent, participation in the study, or adversely affecting compliance to study drugs;\n11. Active infection requiring intravenous antibiotics;\n12. Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or Hepatitis B (defined as Hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] reactive) or known active Hepatitis C virus (defined as HCV Ribonucleic acid (RNA) [qualitative] is detected) infection;\n13. Major surgery within 4 weeks prior to study entry. Minor surgery (excluding diagnostic biopsy) within 1 week prior to study entry;\n14. Any vaccination within 2 weeks prior to starting study treatment;\n15. Treatment with any investigational drug or participation in another investigational study within 3 weeks prior to first IMU-201 dose.",
