Patients must be willing and able to understand and provide written informed consent.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",

Tumors with ≥ 1cm of contrast-enhancing tumor component crossing the midline (crossing the corpus callosum).\n   4. Extensive subependymal disease: multiple lesions or lesions covering > 50% of subependymal space. Tumor touching subependymal space allowed.\n   5. Extensive leptomeningeal disease: multiple lesions or lesions covering > 50% of leptomeninges. Tumor touching leptomeninges allowed.\n3.
