    "inclusion_criteria": "Inclusion criteria:\n\n* Adults aged 60 years or older\n* Diagnosis of a hematological malignancy or other serious hematological disorder that requires an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation\n* Planned to receive any reduced-intensity conditioning regimen (any graft source is acceptable) and availability of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched donor at HLA loci A, B, C, and HLA-DR beta chain antigen (DRB1)\n* Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) of 70% or higher.\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\n* Previous history of one or more prior allogeneic stem cell transplants (i.e., second or third allogeneic transplant)\n* Planned use of high doses of cyclophosphamide (e.g., a total cyclophosphamide dose of approximately 50 mg/kg or more) as part of the conditioning regimen prior to allogeneic stem cell transplant. A lower dose of cyclophosphamide (e.g., fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and low-dose total body irradiation regimen that uses 2 doses of cyclophosphamide at 14.5 mg/kg) is acceptable.\n* Known diagnosis of liver cirrhosis or other advanced liver disease that may impact cyclophosphamide metabolism.\n* Diagnosis of myelofibrosis\n* Creatinine clearance less than 40 mL/min/1.73 mÂ², which may increase the risk of hemorrhagic cystitis with post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy)\n* Systolic cardiac dysfunction with an ejection fraction of less than 45%.\n* Use of a haploidentical or mismatched donor.\n* Any other condition judged by the physician to increase the risk of toxicities associated with PTCy.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 60 Years",
