Note: Patients with either deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary emboli that does not result in hemodynamic instability are allowed to enroll as long as they are on a stable dose of anticoagulants for at least 4 weeks. Also note: Patients with thromboembolic events related to indwelling catheters or other procedures may be enrolled. Finally: patients with stable mesenteric thrombosis that predate study assessment (eg portal vein thrombus) may be enrolled.\n* Has a history of active bleeding requiring transfusion within a 3 month period prior to screening. (Transfusions attributed to chemotherapy related anemia do not meet this exclusion criterion.)\n* Known cases of drug-induced hepatobiliary toxicities (other than a radiological finding of fatty liver).\n* Has had prior treatment with a MEK or ERK inhibitor.\n* Partial or complete bowel obstruction.\n* Impaired gastrointestinal function that may significantly alter the absorption of binimetinib (e.g., ulcerative diseases, uncontrolled vomiting, malabsorption syndrome, small bowel resection with decreased intestinal absorption) or baseline diarrhea >= grade 1.\n* Use of digoxin, mefloquine, cyclosporine, methotrexate, fexofenadine, quinidine, talinolol, vinblastine, coumestrol, daidzein, dantrolene, estrone-3-sulfate, genistein, prazosin, sulfasalazine, or antiepileptics if used for seizures (ok to use the latter if part of a pain regimen).
