    "exclusion_criteria": "* Was previously treated with 225Ac-ABD147.\n* Has a history of steroid dependent hepatitis caused by treatment with a checkpoint inhibitor.\n* Is actively enrolled in another clinical study unless it is an observational (noninterventional) clinical study or the follow-up component of an interventional study.\n* Use of an anticancer therapy, radiotherapy (external beam radiotherapy [EBRT], brachytherapy, inoperative radiation therapy, radiopharmaceuticals), or immunotherapy within 3 weeks prior to C1D1. Prior treatment with DLL3-targeting agent is acceptable with appropriate washout.\n* Has a medical history of myocardial infarction or unstable angina within 6 months before C1D1.\n* Has clinically significant cardiac disease not controlled on medical therapy (eg, congestive cardiac failure, arrhythmia, coronary heart disease).\n* Has evidence of active infection requiring intravenous (IV) antibiotics during Screening requiring therapy within 7 days prior to C1D1.\n* Has active uncontrolled bleeding or a bleeding diathesis within 28 days prior to C1D1.\n* Has serious or non-healing wound, fistula, skin ulcer, or non-healing bone fracture within 7 days prior to C1D1.\n* Has received any thoracic radiotherapy within 8 weeks prior to C1D1.\n* Has a history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, organizing pneumonia (eg, bronchiolitis obliterans), drug-induced pneumonitis (requiring steroids or immunosuppressive agents), or idiopathic pneumonitis, or evidence of active pneumonitis on the Screening chest computed tomography (CT) scan. Note: History of radiation pneumonitis in the radiation field (fibrosis) is permitted.\n* Has known hypersensitivity to Ac-225; for patients participating in the 111In-ABD147 dosimetry substudy, also has known hypersensitivity to In-111.\n* Has known hypersensitivity to Chinese hamster ovary cell products.\n* Has a history of severe allergic anaphylactic reactions to chimeric or humanized antibodies or fusion proteins.\n* Has human immunodeficiency virus infection; patients who are taking an effective antiviral therapy with undetectable viral load prior to C1D1 are eligible.\n* Has chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Patients who are taking an effective suppressive therapy and have an undetectable HBV viral load are eligible.\n* Has a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, unless treated and cured; patients with HCV infection who are currently on treatment and have an undetectable HCV viral load are eligible.\n* Has carcinomatous meningitis.\n* Has active symptomatic cord compression.\n* Has active symptomatic superior vena cava syndrome.\n* Has another primary malignancy that has not been treated with curative intent (discuss with Medical Monitor), except for non-metastatic cutaneous basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma, or non-muscle invasive bladder cancer.\n* Is unwilling or unable to follow protocol requirements.\n* Has any condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would interfere with evaluation of the investigational product or interpretation of the patient's safety or study results.",
