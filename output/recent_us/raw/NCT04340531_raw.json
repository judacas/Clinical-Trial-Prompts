Has received prior radiation therapy\n7. Has received prophylactic administration of haematopoietic colony stimulating factors within 4 weeks (28 days) prior to starting study drug\n8. Patients concurrently using any strong P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inducers/inhibitors or strong cytochrome P3A (CYP3A) inhibitors within 14 days prior to the first dose of study drug or patients that use restricted or prohibited medications listed in the concomitant and other treatments section of the protocol\n9.
