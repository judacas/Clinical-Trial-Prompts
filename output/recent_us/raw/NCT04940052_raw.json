    "inclusion_criteria": "* Male or female subjects ≥18 years old or other legal maturity age according to the country of residence\n* Confirmed diagnosis of cancer (by histology, adequate imaging modality), other than basal-cell or squamous-cell carcinoma of the skin alone with one of the following:\n\n  * Active cancer, defined as either locally active, regionally invasive, or metastatic cancer at the time of randomization and/or\n  * Currently receiving or having received anticancer therapy (radiotherapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, any kind of targeted therapy or any other anticancer therapy) in the last 6 months.\n* Confirmed symptomatic or incidental proximal lower limb deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (i.e., popliteal, femoral, iliac, and/or inferior vena cava [IVC] thrombosis) and/or a confirmed symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE), or an incidental PE in a segmental, or larger pulmonary artery.\n\nPatients are eligible within 120 hours from diagnosis of the qualifying VTE\n\n* Anticoagulation therapy with a therapeutic dose of DOAC for at least 6 months is indicated\n* Able to provide written informed consent\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Thrombectomy, insertion of a caval filter or use of a fibrinolytic agent to treat the current (index) DVT and/or PE\n* More than 120 hours of pre-treatment with therapeutic doses of UFH, LMWH, fondaparinux, DOAC, or other anticoagulants\n* An indication to continue treatment with therapeutic doses of an anticoagulant other than that VTE treatment prior to randomization (e.g., atrial fibrillation [AF], mechanical heart valve, prior VTE)\n* Platelet count <50,000/mm3 at the screening visit\n* PE leading to hemodynamic instability (blood pressure [BP] <90 mmHg or shock)\n* Acute ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke or intracranial hemorrhage within the 4 weeks preceding screening\n* Brain trauma or a cerebral or spinal cord surgery or spinal procedures such as lumbar puncture or epidural/spinal anesthesia within 4 weeks of screening\n* Need for aspirin in a dosage of >100 mg/day or any other antiplatelet agent alone or in combination with aspirin\n* Primary brain cancer or untreated intracranial metastases at baseline\n* Acute myeloid or lymphoid leukemia\n* Bleeding requiring medical attention at the time of randomization or in the preceding 4 weeks\n* Planned brain, spinal cord, cardiac, vascular, major thoracic and/or major abdominal surgery in the 4 weeks following randomization\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 3 or 4 at screening\n* Life expectancy <3 months at randomization\n* Calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl) <30 mL/min (Cockcroft-Gault equation) at the screening visit\n* Hemoglobin <8 g/dL at the screening visit\n* Acute hepatitis, chronic active hepatitis, liver cirrhosis; or an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≥3 x and/or bilirubin ≥2 x upper limit of normal (ULN) at the screening visit in absence of clinical explanation\n* Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic BP>180 mm Hg or diastolic BP >100 mm Hg despite antihypertensive treatment)\n* Women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) who are unwilling or unable to use highly effective contraceptive measures during the study from screening up to 3 days after last treatment of apixaban or 100 days after administration of abelacimab (See Section 5.3.6. for highly effective contraceptive measures)\n* Sexually active males with sexual partners of childbearing potential must agree to use a condom or other reliable contraceptive measure up to 3 days after last treatment of apixaban or 100 days after administration of abelacimab\n* Pregnant or breast-feeding women\n* Patients known to be receiving strong dual inducers or inhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P gp\n* History of hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs (including apixaban) or excipients, to drugs of similar chemical classes, or any contraindication listed in the label for apixaban\n* Subjects with any condition that in the Investigator's judgement would place the subject at increased risk of harm if he/she participated in the study\n* Use of other investigational (not registered) drugs within 5 half-lives prior to enrollment or until the expected pharmacodynamic(s) (PD) effect has returned to baseline, whichever is longer. Participation in academic non-interventional studies or interventional studies, comprising testing different strategies or different combinations of registered drugs is permitted",
