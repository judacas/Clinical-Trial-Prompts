    "official_title": "A Randomized, Double-blind, Multi-center, Phase III Study of AK112 or Placebo Combined with Pemetrexed and Carboplatin in Patients with EGFR-mutant Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non-squamous NSCLC Who Have Failed to EGFR-TKI Treatment",
    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Ability to understand and voluntarily sign a written informed consent form (ICF), which must be signed before the specified study procedures required for the study are performed.\n2. Males or females aged ≥ 18 to ≤ 75 years at the time of signing informed consent. (For patients from North America and Europe, there will be no upper age cutoff)\n3. ECOG performance status score of 0 or 1.\n4. Expected survival ≥3 months.\n5. Histologically or cytology-confirmed, locally advanced (Stage IIIB/IIIC) or metastatic (Stage IV) non-squamous NSCLC (according to TNM staging of lung cancer, 8th edition) that cannot be completely resected by surgery and cannot receive radical concurrent/sequential chemoradiation.\n6. EGFR activation mutations that are confirmed by tumor histology or cytology or blood test before enrollment (eg, exon 18 point mutations, exon 19 deletions, exon 20 point mutations, and exon 21 point mutations). Patients must provide a previous EGFR mutation test report, otherwise tumor tissue samples, peripheral blood samples, or pleural fluid samples will need to be collected for EGFR status testing prior to enrollment.\n7. Prior treatment with EGFR TKI and treatment failure, meeting any of the following requirements: Progression after treatment with first- or second-generation EGFR TKI, and confirmation of absence of T790M mutation after progression (only for patients enrolled in China). Progression after treatment with a third-generation EGFR TKI (eg, osimertinib, ametinib, vometinib). Note, for North America and Europe patients only.\n8. According to RECIST v1.1, there is at least 1 measurable noncerebral lesion.\n9. Adequate organ function determined by the following requirements\n10. Female patients of childbearing age have a negative serum pregnancy test result within 3 days before the first dose\n11. If a female patient of childbearing potential has sex with an unsterilized male partner, the patient must use a highly effective method of contraception from the beginning of screening and must agree to continue using these precautions until 120 days after the last dose of the study drug or until 6 months after the last carboplatin and pemetrexed dose (whichever is longer).\n12. If an unsterilized male patient has sex with a female partner of childbearing potential, the patient must use an effective method of contraception from the beginning of screening to day 120 after the last dose or until 6 months after the last carboplatin and pemetrexed dose (whichever is longer). The decision to stop contraception after this time point should be discussed with investigator.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Histologic or cytopathologic evidence of the presence of a small cell carcinoma component, or a predominantly squamous cell carcinoma.\n2. Patients who have received immune checkpoint inhibitors (eg, anti-PD-1/L1 antibodies, anti-CTLA-4 antibodies, anti-LAG-3 antibodies, etc.)\n3. Received prior systemic chemotherapy, anti-angiogenic therapy, or more than one prior line of antitumor therapy (other than EGFR inhibitors) for advanced stage (IIIB to IV) NSCLC.\n4. Concurrent enrollment in another clinical study, unless it is a noninterventional clinical study or the follow-up period of the interventional study is more than 4 weeks from the last dose of the prior clinical study or more than 5 half-lives of the prior study drug, whichever is shorter.\n5. Received EGFR inhibitor therapy within 2 weeks (with the exception of osimertinib to be within 7 days) prior to the first dose; received nonspecific immunomodulatory therapy (eg, interleukin, interferon, thymus peptide, tumor necrosis factor) within 2 weeks prior to the first dose, excluding IL-11 for the treatment of thrombocytopenia; have received Chinese herbal medicines or proprietary Chinese medicines with antitumor indications within 1 week before the first dose.\n6. Imaging during the screening period shows that the tumor surrounds important blood vessels or has obvious necrosis and/or cavitation of tumor lesions within the lung parenchyma.\n7. Imaging during the screening period shows that the tumor invades the surrounding vital organs and blood vessels, such as the heart and pericardium, trachea, esophagus, aorta, superior vena cava, or patient is at risk of esophageal tracheal fistula or esophageal pleural fistula.\n8. Symptomatic metastases of the central nervous system.\n9. Malignant tumors other than NSCLC within 3 years before the first dose.\n10. Active autoimmune disease requiring systemic therapy (eg, with disease-modifying drugs, corticosteroids, immunosuppressant therapy) within 2 years prior to the first dose (excluding ir AEs due to PD-1/L1 inhibitors). Replacement therapy (eg, thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy (prednisone ≤ 10 mg daily or equivalent) for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency) is permitted.\n11. There is a history of major diseases before the first dose\n12. History of perforation of the gastrointestinal tract and/or fistula, history of gastrointestinal obstruction (including incomplete intestinal obstruction requiring parenteral nutrition), extensive bowel resection (partial colectomy or extensive small bowel resection, complicated by chronic diarrhea) within 6 months before the first study drug administration.\n13. Patients with >30 Gy of chest radiation therapy within 6 months prior to the first dose, nonthoracic radiation therapy >30 Gy within 4 weeks prior to the first dose, and palliative radiation therapy of ≤30 Gy within 2 weeks prior to the first dose and failed to recover from the toxicity and/or complications of these interventions to NCI CTCAE Grade ≤1 (except hair loss and fatigue). Palliative radiotherapy for symptom control is permitted if it has been completed at least 2 weeks before the first dose, and no additional radiotherapy for the same lesion is planned.\n14. Inactivated vaccines are allowed. Patients are excluded if they have received a live vaccine or live attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the first dose, or if they are scheduled to receive a live vaccine or live attenuated vaccine during the study period.\n15. Severe infection within 4 weeks prior to the first dose, including but not limited to comorbidities requiring hospitalization, sepsis, or severe pneumonia; active infection that has received systemic anti-infective therapy within 2 weeks prior to the first dose (excluding antiviral therapy for hepatitis B or C)",
