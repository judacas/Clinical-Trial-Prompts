Male and female patients of childbearing potential must agree to use effective methods of contraception from the time of first negative pregnancy test at screening, throughout the study and for 6 months after the last dose of the investigational product. A patient is of childbearing potential if, in the opinion of the investigator, he/she is biologically capable of having children and is sexually active.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Has received any investigational agents within 21 days prior to the first administration of TSN084; or have stopped any investigational agents or other anti-tumors drugs for less than 5 half-lives or 21 days, whichever is longer;\n* Acute toxic effects of prior anti-tumor therapy have not recovered to clinically significant NCI-CTCAE V5.0 grade ≤1 toxicity or baseline prior to the first administration of TSN084.\n* At rest, the average Corrected QT interval (QTc, Fridericia's correction formula used) obtained by 12-lead Electrocardiograph (ECG) examination is > 470 ms (repeated 3 times). A variety of clinically significant arrhythmia, conduction, and resting ECG abnormalities, such as complete left bundle branch block, degree III, degree II, PR interval >250 ms. Various factors that may increase the risk of prolonged QTc or arrhythmia events, such as heart failure, hypokalemia, congenital long QT syndrome, a family history of long QT syndrome in a direct family member or sudden unexplained death before age 40, and use of any medications known to prolong QT intervals.\n* Has an acute or chronic active hepatitis B defined as hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA copy number ≥1×103 copies/mL or ≥ 200 IU/ml.\n* Has acute or chronic active hepatitis C (HCV) defined as HCV-RNA level greater than the upper limit of the central reference value.\n* Patients with active brain metastases will be allowed to enroll if their central nervous system (CNS) tumor metastases are confined to the supratentorial or cerebellum, have been adequately treated (surgery or radiotherapy), have maintained radiographic stability for at least 4 weeks, and do not require corticosteroids to control symptoms.\n* Concurrent diseases that have not been controlled, such as:\n\n  1. Severe infection, including but not limited to hospitalization due to infection, bacteremia, or severe pneumonia complications, occurs within 4 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment; Or patients who received therapeutic oral or intravenous antibiotics within two weeks prior to starting study treatment, and who received prophylactic antibiotics (e.g., for the prevention of urinary tract infection or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease);\n  2.

After endoesophageal or tracheal stent implantation;\n  12.

Uncontrolled third space effusion requiring repeated drainage, such as pleural effusion, ascites, pericardial effusion, etc. (Patients who do not need drainage effusion or have no significant increase in effusion after 3 days of cessation of drainage can be included).\n* Expected to receive other anti-tumor therapies during the study (palliative radiotherapy is allowed).\n* Allergic to TSN084 or its components.\n* Has active gastrointestinal disease or other disease, or other factors such as surgical resection that may significantly affect drug absorption, metabolism, or excretion. This includes but not limited to the following conditions: malabsorption syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, partial or complete intestinal obstruction, gastric or small intestinal resection.\n* Has severe lung disease or history, such as moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), drug-induced ILD, acute or chronic infectious pneumonia, lung transplantation, etc.\n* Use of strong inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A drugs.\n* Pregnant or lactating women.\n* Dysphagia.\n* Being involved in another interventional clinical study, or in an observational (non-interventional) clinical study, or in the follow-up phase of an interventional study.\n* Known history of allogeneic organ transplantation and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.\n* Had a major surgical procedure (craniotomy, thoracotomy, laparotomy, vascular intervention, as defined by the investigator) within 4 weeks prior to the first administration of the investigational product, or had an unhealed wound, ulcer, or fracture.
