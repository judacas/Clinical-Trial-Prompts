    "official_title": "A Phase 3, Randomized, Open-Label, Active-Controlled Study to Evaluate a Switch to an Oral Weekly Islatravir/Lenacapavir Regimen in People With HIV-1 Who Are Virologically Suppressed on Standard of Care",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL for ≥ 6 months before screening, as documented by:\n\n  1. One HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL immediately preceding the 24 weeks period prior to screening.\n  2. Within 24 weeks prior to screening, if HIV-1 RNA results are available, all levels must be < 50 copies/mL.\n  3. During the 6 to 12 months period prior to screening, transient detectable viremia ≥ 50 copies/mL is acceptable (\"blip\") as long as it is not confirmed on 2 consecutive visits.\n* Plasma HIV-1 RNA levels < 50 copies/mL at screening.\n* Are receiving guideline-recommended standard of care treatment such as International Antiviral Society (IAS), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), European AIDS Clinical Society (EACS) consisting of 2 or 3 ARVs for ≥ 6 months prior to screening and willing to continue until Day 1. Individuals in Treatment Group 2 must also be willing to continue their standard of care through at least Week 96.\n* Individuals assigned female at birth and of childbearing potential who engage in heterosexual intercourse must agree to use protocol-specified methods of contraception.\n\nKey\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Prior virologic failure.\n* Prior use of, or exposure to, ISL or LEN.\n* Active, serious infections requiring parenteral therapy within 30 days before randomization.\n* Active tuberculosis infection.\n* Acute hepatitis within 30 days before randomization.\n* Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, as determined below at the screening visit:\n\n  1. positive HBV surface antigen OR\n  2. positive HBV core antibody and negative HBV surface antibody. Note: individuals found to be susceptible to HBV infection (eg negative hepatitis B surface antibody at the screening visit, regardless of prior HBV vaccination history) should be recommended to receive HBV vaccination.\n* Active hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection, defined as detectable HCV RNA. Note: individuals with prior/inactive HCV infection (defined as undetectable HCV RNA) may be enrolled.\n* Any of the following laboratory values at screening:\n\n  1. Creatinine clearance (CLcr) ≤ 30 mL/min according to the Cockcroft-Gault formula\n  2. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) > 5 x upper limit of normal (ULN)\n  3. Direct bilirubin > 1.5 x ULN\n  4. Platelets < 50,000/μL\n  5. Hemoglobin < 8.0 g/dL\n\nNote: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.",
