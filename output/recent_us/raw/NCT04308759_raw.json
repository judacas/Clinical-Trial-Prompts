    "inclusion_criteria": "Age\n\n1. Participant must be ≥ 18 years or the legal age of consent in the jurisdiction in which the study is taking place, whichever is greater, at the time of signing the informed consent.\n\n   Type of Participant and Disease Characteristics\n2. Histologically documented MCL based on criteria established by the World Health Organization with documentation of chromosomal translocation t(11;14) (q13;q32) and/or overexpression of cyclin D1 in association with other relevant markers (e.g., CD5, CD19, CD20 or PAX5).\n3. Clinical Stage II, III, or IV by Ann Arbor Classification and requiring systemic treatment in the opinion of the treating clinician.\n4. At least 1 measurable site of disease per Lugano Classification for NHL (Appendix K). The site of disease must be > 1.5 cm in the long axis regardless of short axis measurement or > 1.0 cm in the short axis regardless of long axis measurement, and clearly measurable in 2 perpendicular dimensions, as assessed by diagnostic quality CT (MRI may be used for participants who are either allergic to CT contrast media or have renal insufficiency that per institutional guidelines restricts the use of CT contrast media).\n\n   OR Participant with leukemic non-nodal MCL presentation with splenomegaly (spleen >13 cm in length cranial to caudal) and Bone Marrow (BM) involvement.\n5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group PS of 0, 1, or 2 and ECOG PS of 3 if poor PS is due to lymphoma.\n6. Confirmed availability of sufficient FFPE tumour samples for central laboratory genomic profiling, including TP53 and clone identification for MRD testing per clonoSEQ® assay. Participants with leukemic non-nodal MCL may be enrolled with available BM tissue. For non-nodal leukaemic MCL participants and when nodal or extranodal tissue is not easily accessible and an invasive biopsy will cause a significant risk to the participant, the participant can be enrolled without a tissue biopsy if MCL BM involvement is confirmed by a BM biopsy and sufficient BM biopsy and aspirate provided for TP53 testing, tumour profiling and clone identification for MRD testing.\n7. Adequate organ and bone marrow function.\n\nSex and Contraceptive/Barrier Requirements 8 Male and/or female Contraceptive use by males or females should be consistent with local regulations regarding the methods of contraception for those participating in clinical studies.\n\n1. Male participants:\n\n   - Male participants with a female partner of child-bearing potential should use a condom from enrolment, throughout the study until 90 days following the last dose of venetoclax or rituximab, whichever is longer.\n   * For non-pregnant potentially childbearing partners, contraception recommendations should also be considered. A male participant must agree to refrain from sperm donation throughout the study until 90 days following the last dose of venetoclax or rituximab, whichever is longer.\n2. Female participants:\n\n   * Women of childbearing potential must have negative serum pregnancy test result prior to the start of study intervention (Cycle 1 Day 1) and agree to abstain from breastfeeding during study participation and at least 12 months after the last drug administration.\n   * Female participants of childbearing potential who are sexually active with a nonsterilized male partner must agree to use at least one highly effective form of birth control from enrolment, throughout the study and at least 2 days after the last dose of acalabrutinib, at least 6 months after the last dose of venetoclax, and at least 12 months after the last dose of rituximab, whichever is longer.\n\nInformed Consent 9 Capable of giving signed informed consent which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the ICF and in this protocol. Informed consent may be given either by the participant or their legally authorised representative.\n\n10 Provision of signed and dated written Optional Genetic Research Information informed consent prior to collection of samples for optional genetic research that supports the Genomic Initiative.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "Medical Conditions\n\n1. Active CNS involvement by lymphoma or leptomeningeal disease\n2. Current or previous active malignancies requiring anticancer therapy except:\n\n   - adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer\n\n   - in situ cancer\n\n   - history of cancer with no evidence of recurrence for ≥ 2 years before enrolment\n\n   - local radiotherapy with a field that does not overlap with sites of current MCL disease and given at least 3 months prior to the screening PET-CT scan and the participant had recovered from any associated toxicity.\n\n   - anti-hormonal therapies are permitted after discussion with the sponsor's medical monitor\n3. Participants for whom the goal of therapy is tumour debulking before ASCT\n4. Any severe or life-threatening illness, medical condition (e.g., uncontrolled hypertension, bleeding diathesis), or organ system dysfunction which, in the investigator' opinion, could compromise the participant safety, interfere with the absorption or metabolism of study intervention (acalabrutinib, rituximab, venetoclax) or put the study outcomes at undue risk\n5. Clinically significant cardiovascular disease such as uncontrolled or untreated symptomatic arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, or myocardial infarction within 6 months of screening, or any Class 3 (moderate) or Class 4 (severe) cardiac disease as defined by the New York Heart Association Functional Classification, or QTc > 480 msec at screening. Exception: Participants with controlled, asymptomatic atrial fibrillation during screening may enroll.\n6. Any active uncontrolled infection (bacterial, viral, fungal, or other infection including tuberculosis), defined as exhibiting ongoing signs/symptoms related to the infection and without improvement, despite appropriate antibiotics or other treatment, which in the investigator's opinion makes it undesirable or pose a safety risk for the participant to participate in the study.\n7. HIV infection. As per standard of care, results of HIV serology should be known prior to start of study intervention.

Participants who are HBsAg positive or HBV-DNA PCR positive will not be eligible.
