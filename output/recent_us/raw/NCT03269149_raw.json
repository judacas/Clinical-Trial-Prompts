    "exclusion_criteria": "* A history of other malignancy with the exception of malignancies for which all treatment was completed at least 2 years before registration and the patient has no evidence of disease.\n* Received radiation therapy within the area of interest.\n* Currently receiving any other investigational agents.\n* Metastatic disease.\n* A history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to pembrolizumab or other agents used in the study.\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, or cardiac arrhythmia.\n* Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of study treatment. The use of up to 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent is approved and does not exclude the patient from the trial.\n* Active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in past 2 years (i.e., with use of disease modifying agents, > 10 mg of prednisone per day, or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment. The use of up to 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent is approved and does not exclude the patient from the trial.\n* Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis/Interstitial lung disease that required maintenance steroids (>10 mg of prednisone) or current pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease.\n* Has received a live vaccine or live-attenuated vaccination within 30 days of planned treatment start. Administration of killed vaccines is allowed.\n* Pregnant and/or breastfeeding.
