>= 150 days after TBI, craniospinal XRT or if radiation to >= 50% of the pelvis; >= 42 days if other substantial brain metastases (BM) radiation; Note: radiation may not be delivered to \"measurable disease\" tumor site(s) being used to follow response to subprotocol treatment\n  * Radiopharmaceutical therapy (e.g., radiolabeled antibody, 131I-MIBG): >= 42 days after systemically administered radiopharmaceutical therapy\n  * Patients must not have received prior exposure to other NTRK inhibitors including but not limited to LOXO-101 (larotrectinib), entrectinib (RXDX-101), DS6051, PLX7486\n* For patients with solid tumors without known bone marrow involvement:\n\n  * Peripheral absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >= 1000/mm^3 (within 7 days prior to enrollment)\n  * Platelet count >= 100,000/mm^3 (transfusion independent, defined as not receiving platelet transfusions for at least 7 days prior to enrollment) (within 7 days prior to enrollment)\n* Patients with known bone marrow metastatic disease will be eligible for study provided they meet the blood counts (may receive transfusions provided they are not known to be refractory to red cell or platelet transfusions); these patients will not be evaluable for hematologic toxicity\n* Creatinine clearance or radioisotope glomerular filtration rate (GFR) >= 70 ml/min/1.73 m^2 (within 7 days prior to enrollment) or\n* A serum creatinine based on age/gender as follows (within 7 days prior to enrollment):\n\n  * Age: 1 to < 2 years;
