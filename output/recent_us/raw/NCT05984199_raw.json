    "inclusion_criteria": "* Ages > 50 years with hematologic malignancies treatable by unrelated hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT)\n* Ages 18-50 years with hematologic diseases treatable by allogeneic HCT who through pre-existing medical conditions or prior therapy are considered to be at high risk for regimen related toxicity associated with a high dose transplant\n* Ages 18-50 years with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)\n* Ages 18-50 years with hematologic diseases treatable by allogeneic HCT who refuse a high-dose HCT; transplants must be approved for these inclusion criteria by the principal investigator\n* The following diseases will be permitted although other diagnoses can be considered if approved by PCC and the principal investigator.\n\n  * Aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) and other histologies such as diffuse large B cell NHL- not eligible for autologous HCT, not eligible for high-dose allogeneic HCT, or after failed autologous HCT\n  * Mantle cell NHL - may be treated in first complete remission (CR); (diagnostic lumbar puncture [LP] required pre-transplant)\n  * Low grade NHL - with < 6 month duration of CR between courses of conventional therapy\n  * CLL - must have either 1) failed to meet National Cancer Institute (NCI) Working Group criteria for complete or partial response after therapy with a regimen containing fludarabine (FLU) (or another nucleoside analog, e.g. cladribine [2-CDA], pentostatin) or experience disease relapse within 12 months after completing therapy with a regimen containing FLU (or another nucleoside analog); 2) failed FLU-cyclophosphamide (CY)-rituximab (FCR) combination chemotherapy at any time point; or 3) have \"17p deletion\" cytogenetic abnormality; patients should have received induction chemotherapy but could be transplanted in 1st CR; or 4) patients with a diagnosis of CLL (or small lymphocytic lymphoma) or diagnosis of CLL that progresses to prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL), or T-cell CLL or PLL; 5) patients failing to achieve a response to ibrutinib as first-line therapy; 6) patients not responding to ibrutinib, idelalisib, or venetoclax as salvage therapy or intolerant of these agents as salvage therapy due to side effects; all CLL patients must have received prior myelosuppressive chemotherapy\n  * Hodgkin lymphoma - must have received and failed frontline therapy\n  * Multiple myeloma - must have received prior chemotherapy; consolidation of chemotherapy by autografting prior to nonmyeloablative HCT is permitted\n  * Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) - must have < 5% marrow blasts at the time of transplant\n  * Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) - must have < 5% marrow blasts at the time of transplant\n  * Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) - patients in CP1 must have failed or be intolerant of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs); patients beyond CP1 will be accepted if they have < 5% marrow blasts at time of transplant\n  * Myelodysplasia (MDS)/myeloproliferative syndrome (MPS)/chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) - patients must have < 5% marrow blasts at time of transplant\n  * Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia - must have failed 2 courses of therapy\n  * Mixed Phenotype Acute Leukemia (MPAL) - must have < 5% marrow blasts at the time of transplant.\n  * Blastic Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cell Neoplasm (BPDCN) - must be in complete remission at the time of transplant\n* HLA-MATCHED UNRELATED DONOR: FHCRC matching allowed will be grades 1.0 to 2.1; unrelated donors who are prospectively:\n\n  * Matched for HLA-A, B, C, DRB1 and DQB1 by high resolution typing;\n  * Only a single allele disparity will be allowed for HLA-A, B, or C as defined by high resolution typing\n* HLA-MATCHED UNRELATED DONOR: Donors are excluded when preexisting immunoreactivity is identified that would jeopardize donor hematopoietic cell engraftment; this determination is based on the standard practice of the individual institution; the recommended procedure for patients with 10 of 10 HLA allele level (phenotypic) match is to obtain a panel reactive antibody (PRA) screens to class I and class II antigens for all patients before HCT; if the PRA shows > 10% activity, then flow cytometric or B and T cell cytotoxic cross matches should be obtained; the donor should be excluded if any of the cytotoxic cross match assays are positive; for those patients with an HLA Class I allele mismatch, flow cytometric or B and T cell cytotoxic cross matches should be obtained regardless of the PRA results; a positive anti-donor cytotoxic crossmatch is an absolute donor exclusion\n* HLA-MATCHED UNRELATED DONOR: Patient and donor pairs homozygous at a mismatched allele in the graft rejection vector are considered a two-allele mismatch, i.e., the patient is A*0101 and the donor is A*0102, and this type of mismatch is not allowed\n* HLA-MATCHED UNRELATED DONOR: Only granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) mobilized PBSC will be permitted as a HSC source on this protocol\n* HLA-MISMATCHED UNRELATED DONOR: Unrelated volunteer donors who are mismatched with the recipient within one of the following limitations:\n\n  * Mismatch for one HLA class I antigen with or without an additional mismatch for one HLA-class I allele, but matched for HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQ, OR\n  * Mismatched for two HLA class I alleles, but matched for HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQ\n  * HLA class I HLA-A, -B, -C allele matched donors allowing for any one or two DRB1 and/or DQB1 antigen/allele mismatch\n* HLA-MISMATCHED UNRELATED DONOR: HLA-matching must be based on results of high resolution typing at HLA-A, -B, -C, - DRB1, and -DQ\n* HLA-MISMATCHED UNRELATED DONOR: If the patient is homozygous at the mismatch HLA class I locus or II locus, the donor must be heterozygous at that locus and one allele must match the patient (i.e., patient is homozygous A*01:01 and donor is heterozygous A*01:01, A*02:01); this mismatch will be considered a one-antigen mismatch for rejection only\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
