Potassium, sodium, calcium (corrected for serum albumin) and magnesium CTCAE Grade ≤1 (if screening assessments are abnormal, these assessments may be repeated up to 2 times; subjects may receive appropriate supplementation or treatment prior to reassessment)\n    5. Creatinine clearance (per Cockcroft-Gault formula) ≥50 mL/min\n    6. Serum albumin ≥3.0 g/dL (≥30 g/L)\n    7. Liver function tests:\n\n       In absence of liver metastases, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤3.0 × upper limit of normal (ULN). If the patient has liver metastases, ALT and AST ≤5 × ULN.\n    8. Total serum bilirubin <1.5 × ULN except for patients with Gilbert's syndrome who may be included if the total serum bilirubin is ≤3.0 × ULN or direct bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × ULN\n11. The patient is willing and able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Immediate CNS-specific treatment is likely to be required, per the treating physician's assessment.\n2. Patient has imminent organ failure and/or visceral crisis.\n3.
