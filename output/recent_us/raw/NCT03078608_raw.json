    "inclusion_criteria": "* Age 15-39 years\n* History of one or more cancer diagnoses with all treatment (surgery, chemotherapy, radiation) completed ≥ 3 months before enrollment)\n* BIS ≥10 at time of screening\n* Ability to provide consent or assent and parental consent if applicable.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 15 Years\nMust have maximum age of 39 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Plan to receive surgery, radiation, chemotherapy (including biologic agents, immunotherapy, and other targeted agents) for cancer treatment during the study period (from baseline assessment through post-four-week assessments and interview). Participants may continue with surveillance (such as imaging or biopsies) during the study period.\n* Initiation of new treatments for body image distress or anxiety (e.g., pharmacologic, psychotherapy) ≤8 weeks prior to study enrollment. Although, participants may continue psychosocial or pharmacological treatments for anxiety or body image distress if the treatment were initiated at least eight weeks prior to study enrollment, the dose has not changed, and they report clinically relevant body image distress.\n* History of limb-altering surgery or amputation (surgical exclusions are based on the premise that significant appearance-altering surgeries may impact body image distress differently than other cancer therapies)\n* Currently receiving end-of-life care",
