    "inclusion_criteria": "* Subjects must have histologically confirmed urothelial carcinoma of the bladder, clinical stage T2-3N0M0. Micropapillary, glandular, squamous, and sarcomatoid histologic variants of urothelial carcinoma are allowed.\n* Subjects must have unifocal or limited multifocal disease amenable to complete surgical resection with partial cystectomy, as judged by the treating urologic oncologist.\n* Age >18 years. Because of the rarity of this disease and limited data on treatment efficacy in subjects 18 years of age, children are excluded from this study.\n* Performance status - Karnofsky Performance Status ≥70 or Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status Grade 0 or 1.\n* Subjects must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:\n\n  * Total bilirubin within normal limits\n  * AST (SGOT) ≤ 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal\n  * ALT (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal\n  * Bone marrow:\n\n    * Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,500/mm3\n    * Platelet count ≥ 80,000/mm3, Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL\n* Subjects must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n* Subjects must have tumor less than or equal to 5 cm in largest dimension as assessed radiographically.\n* Treatment naive for MIBC.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 19 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Presence of hydronephrosis.\n* Presence of multifocal disease that is not amenable to complete resection with partial cystectomy.\n* Presence of distant carcinoma in situ.\n* Presence of clinical N+ or M+ disease.\n* Presence of cT4+ disease.\n* Non-urothelial histology.\n* Concurrent upper tract (ureter or renal pelvis) or urethral urothelial carcinoma.\n* Subjects who are not surgical candidates due to competing medical comorbidities or who refuse surgical treatment.\n* Any condition for which, in the opinion of the investigator, participation would not be in the best interest of the participant (eg, compromise the well-being) or that could prevent, limit, or confound the protocol-specified assessments.",
