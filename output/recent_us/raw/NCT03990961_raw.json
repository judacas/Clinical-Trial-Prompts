Radiation therapy must be completed at least 7 days prior to registration.\n* Absolute Neutrophil Count ≥ 1000/μL\n* Platelets ≥ 75,000/μL (or ≥50,000/mm3 if known BM involvement)\n* Calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 40 cc/min using the Cockcroft-Gault formula\n* Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN)\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 2.5 × ULN\n* Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 × ULN\n* Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to registration. NOTE: Females are considered of child bearing potential unless they are surgically sterile (have undergone a hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or they are naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months\n* Males who are sexually active with partners of child-bearing potential must be willing to abstain from heterosexual activity or adhere to contraception from the time of written consent until 7 months after treatment discontinuation.\n* Patient must provide voluntary written informed consent prior to the performance of any research related tests or procedures.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",

NOTES: Hepatitis B and C testing is required. Patients with positive Hepatitis B Ag may enroll if PCR is negative. Suppressive antiviral therapy should be considered for these patients as clinically indicated.\n* Currently active, clinically significant hepatic impairment Child-Pugh class B or C\n* Currently receiving a strong CYP3A4 Inhibitor (such as but not limited to boceprevir clarithromycin, conivaptan, grapefruit juice, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, lopinavir/ritonavir, mibefradil, nefazodone, nelfinavir, posaconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, telithromycin, voriconazole) or Fluconazole >200 mg/day.
