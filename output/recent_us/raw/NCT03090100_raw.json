Patients that are not within institutional normal range but have a 24-hour Creatinine Clearance or GFR (radioisotope or iothalamate) ≥ 70 mL/min/1.73 m^2 are eligible.\n\nCorticosteroids\n\n* Patients who are receiving dexamethasone must be on a stable or decreasing dose for at least 7 days prior to enrollment.\n\nGrowth Factors\n\n* Patients must be off all colony-forming growth factor(s) for at least 7 days prior to enrollment (e.g., filgrastim, sargramostim or erythropoietin).
