Female patients of childbearing potential who are sexually active with a nonsterilized male partner must use at least one highly effective method of contraception, and must agree to continue using such precautions for 90 days after the last dose of investigational product.\n11. Nonsterilized male patients who are sexually active with a female partner of childbearing potential must use a male condom plus spermicide from 7 days post-screening and for 90 days after receipt of the last dose of investigational product.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 101 Years",

Active central nervous system (CNS) metastases, unless adequately treated and patients have neurologically returned to baseline (except for residual signs or symptoms related to the CNS treatment) and prednisolone 10 mg or less for more than 2 weeks prior to enrollment. For SCLC, a brain MRI scan that was conducted ≤ 28 days from Day 1 is required.\n2.

Treatment with anticancer therapy including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, biologic, or any investigational therapy within 21 days, or prior palliative radiotherapy within 2 weeks of the first dose of investigational product.\n\n5 Prior treatment with other Pyrrolobenzodiazepine-Antibody Drug Conjugates.\n\n6 History of previous malignancies (except for locally curable cancers) unless a complete remission was achieved at least 3 years prior to study entry AND no additional therapy is required during the study period (except adjuvant hormonal therapy and bisphosphonate).\n\n7. Failure to recover from major surgery or significant traumatic injury within 21 days of first dose of study treatment.\n\n8 History of hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, also called veno-occlusive disease 9. History of capillary leak syndrome. 10 Blood transfusion within 14 days of study entry except when needed for disease related anemia.\n\n11.

Current severe active systemic disease including active concurrent malignancy 14. Pregnancy and/or breastfeeding at time of screening 15. Concurrent enrollment in anther clinical study involving an investigational treatment that is not an extension of another MedImmune study with the same investigational product.",
