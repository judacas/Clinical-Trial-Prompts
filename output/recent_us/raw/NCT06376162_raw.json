    "official_title": "Phase I Trial of Real-Time Intraoperative Fluorescent Imaging of Nerve Structures Using Illuminare-1, a Novel Myelin-Binding Fluorophore",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* 18 years or older and capable of signing their own consent form\n* Scheduled for minimally invasive radical prostatectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be MALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Prior pelvic surgery or pelvic radiation therapy\n* Known central nervous or peripheral nervous system disease or insult (including neurodegenerative diseases), current use of neurotoxic medications, or use of cytotoxic chemotherapy with known neurotoxicity within 1 month\n* Exposure to investigational agents in the immediate 30 days before or 15 days after study drug administration\n* Patients with significant renal dysfunction (<60 mL/min as assessed by the Cockcroft Gault calculation for creatinine clearance)\n* Clinically significant hepatic/liver impairment (liver function tests more than 2x institutional normal upper limit)\n* Exposure to phototoxic drugs such as St. John's wort, griseofulvin, thiazide diuretics, sulfonylureas, phenothiazines, sulphonamides, quinolones, and tetracyclines, should be avoided. If safe to discontinue use for a limited time, patients may participate on this trial but will discontinue the use of the interfering drug for 5 half-lives before Illuminare-1 injection to permit full washout, as well as for 48 hours after administration of Illuminare-1.",
