    "inclusion_criteria": "* Has SARS-CoV-2-positive antigen or molecular diagnostic test (by validated SARS-CoV-2 antigen, RT-PCR, or other molecular diagnostic assay, using an appropriate sample such as NP, nasal, oropharyngeal [OP], or saliva) ≤72 hours prior to randomization and no alternative explanation for current clinical condition. A historical record of positive result from test conducted ≤72 hours prior to randomization is acceptable.\n* Has symptoms consistent with COVID-19, as determined by investigator, with onset ≤10 days before randomization\n* Hospitalized for ≤72 hours with at least 1 of the following at randomization; patients meeting more than one criterion will be categorized in the most severely affected category:\n\n  1. Cohort 1A: With COVID-19 symptoms but not requiring supplemental oxygen\n  2. Cohort 1: Maintains O2 saturation >93% on low-flow oxygen as defined in the protocol\n  3. Cohort 2: High-intensity oxygen therapy without mechanical ventilation as defined in the protocol\n  4. Cohort 3: On mechanical ventilation\n\nKey\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Phase 1 Only: Patients maintaining O2 saturation >94% on room air\n* In the opinion of the investigator, unlikely to survive for >48 hours from screening\n* Receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)\n* Has new-onset stroke or seizure disorder during hospitalization\n* Initiated on renal replacement therapy due to COVID-19\n\nNOTE: Other protocol defined inclusion / exclusion criteria apply",
