    "inclusion_criteria": "Procurement Inclusion Criteria for the Patient\n\nReferred patients (Group A) or their previous HSCT donors (Group B) will initially be consented for procurement of blood for generation of the transduced ATL. Patient eligibility criteria at this stage include:\n\n1. Diagnosis of recurrent T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), T-cell acute lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LLy), or T-non-Hodgkin lymphoma (T-NHL, including Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), Enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL), Monomorphic epitheliotropic intestinal T-cell lymphoma (MEITL), Peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) NOS, Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, T cell prolymphocytic leukemia with symptomatic disease, Extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma, Mycosis fungoides/ Sezary Syndrome Stage IIB or higher))\n\n   AND\n\n   Group A (auto arm): Transplant naïve or relapsed post-allogeneic HSCT OR\n\n   Group B (allo arm): Relapsed post-allogeneic HSCT with previous HSCT donor from whom allogeneic MAGENTA CAR T cells can be manufactured\n\n   AND\n   * Suitable for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) with confirmation of an identified eligible allo-HSCT donor by FACT accredited institution\n   * Confirmation that the center plans to proceed with transplant if CD5.CAR treatment induces a complete remission.\n\n     * For T-NHL subjects, eligibility will be confined to disease stages where allogeneic HSCT is indicated.\n2. CD5-positive tumor (result can be pending at this time). > 50% CD5 + blasts by flow cytometry or immunohistochemistry (tissue) assessed by a CLIA certified Flow Cytometry/Pathology laboratory.\n3. Age ≤75 years old. NOTE: The first six (6) patients treated on the study should be adults (>18 yrs of age).\n4. Life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks.\n5. Patients must have an available partially-HLA matched allogeneic EBV-specific T cell line on a BCM IRB approved protocol which can be used as treatment in the event of uncontrolled EBV reactivation\n6. Informed consent explained to, understood by and signed by patient/guardian. Patient/guardian given copy of informed consent.\n7. Hgb greather than or equal to 7.0 g/dL (can be transfused)\n8. If pheresis required to collect blood:\n\n   * Creatinine <1.5 × upper limit normal\n   * AST <1.5 × upper limit normal\n   * PT and APTT <1.5 × upper limit normal\n\nProcurement Exclusion Criteria for the Patient (Group A)\n\n1. Active infection requiring antibiotics.\n2. Active infection with HIV\n3. History of other cancer (except non-melanoma skin cancer or in situ breast cancer or cervix cancer) unless the tumor was successfully treated with curative intent at least 2 years before trial entry.\n\nProcurement Inclusion Criteria for Normal Healthy Donor (Group B):\n\n1. Donor must be prior hematopoietic stem cell transplant donor for patients relapsed post-allogeneic HSCT. Prior transplant donors will be screened with the standard blood bank donor questionnaire, medical history, and testing for infectious disease markers (IDMs; which may be pending at the time of blood collection). Medical history may be obtained by the patient's primary/referring transplant team if collection is being done remotely. The physician assessment, donor questionnaire, and IDMs will be reviewed by the principle investigator or appropriate designee to confirm/provide final eligibility determination and documented in the donor's medical record.\n2. Informed consent explained to, understood by and signed by donor/LAR. Donor/LAR given copy of informed consent.\n\nTreatment Inclusion Criteria\n\nPatients must meet the following eligibility criteria to be included for treatment:\n\n1. Diagnosis of recurrent T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), T-cell acute lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LLy), or T-non-Hodgkin lymphoma (T-NHL, including Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), Enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL), Monomorphic epitheliotropic intestinal T-cell lymphoma (MEITL), Peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) NOS, Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, T cell prolymphocytic leukemia with symptomatic disease, Extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma, Mycosis fungoides/ Sezary Syndrome Stage IIB or higher))\n\n   AND\n\n   Group A (auto arm): Transplant naïve or relapsed post-allogeneic HSCT OR\n\n   Group B (allo arm): Relapsed post-allogeneic HSCT with previous HSCT donor from whom allogeneic MAGENTA CAR T cells can be manufactured\n\n   AND\n   * Suitable for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) with confirmation of an identified eligible allo-HSCT donor by FACT accredited institution\n   * Confirmation that the center plans to proceed with transplant if CD5.CAR treatment induces a complete remission.\n\n     * For T-NHL subjects, eligibility will be confined to disease stages where allogeneic HSCT is indicated.\n2. CD5-positive tumor. >50% CD5 + blasts by flow cytometry or immunohistochemistry (tissue) assessed by a CLIA certified Flow Cytometry/Pathology laboratory.\n3. Age <75 years old. NOTE: The first six (6) patients treated on the study should be adults (>18 yrs of age).\n4. Bilirubin less than 3 times the upper limit of normal.\n5. AST less than 5 times the upper limit of normal.\n6. Estimated GFR > 60 mL/min.\n7. Pulse oximetry of > 90% on room air.\n8. Karnofsky or Lansky score of ≥ 60%.\n9. Recovered from acute toxic effects of prior chemotherapy at least one week before entering this study.\n10. ≥ 60 days post-allogeneic HSCT at time of treatment.\n11.
