All tumors must have histologic verification at either time of initial diagnosis or recurrence. Note: For this study, refractory disease is specifically defined as presence of persistent abnormality on conventional MRI that is further distinguished by histology (tissue sample) or advanced imaging, i.e., diffusion weighted sequences or MR spectroscopy.\n* Patients must have disease, defined as tumor measurable in two perpendicular diameters on MRI, OR diffuse leptomeningeal disease, OR clear MRI evidence of disease that may not be measurable in two perpendicular diameters. Patients may have tumor cells in CSF with or without radiographic evidence of disease at time of enrollment.\n* Patients must be < 22 years of age at time of enrollment.\n* Protocol treatment with radioimmunotherapy (131I-omburtamab) will require the presence of an appropriate intraventricular access device (e.g., programmable ventriculoperitoneal [VP] shunt or Ommaya reservoir). Patients are not required to have an existing programmable VP shunt or Ommaya at time of study enrollment but must be willing and able to undergo a surgical procedure to have one placed prior to Radioimmunotherapy. Note: Patients with an existing intraventricular VP shunt without a programmable component must be willing and able to undergo modification of the shunt before treatment with 131I-omburtamab.\n* Patients must have recurrent, progressive, or refractory medulloblastoma after prior craniospinal irradiation (CSI) therapy with or without prior chemotherapy, unless CSI is contraindicated or determined to be not in the best interest of patient due to underlying medical conditions or declined by patient/family. Patients must have experienced no more than two recurrences of medulloblastoma or have refractory disease. Note: Patients with contraindications to radiation therapy are still eligible.\n* Patients must have received their last dose of known myelosuppressive anticancer therapy at least 21 days prior to enrollment or at least 42 days if prior nitrosourea.\n* Biologic or investigational agent (anti-neoplastic) - Patient must have recovered from any acute toxicity potentially related to the agent and received their last dose of the investigational or biologic agent ≥ 7 days prior to study enrollment.
