    "official_title": "Noninvasive Detection and Assessment of Therapy Response in Multiple Myeloma Using Whole-Body MRI",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Patients with pathologically confirmed myeloma.\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status 0, 1, or 2.\n* For cross-sectional study, no additional required treatment schedule. For longitudinal study: Patients scheduled to undergo bone marrow biopsy (BMB) and induction therapy (or have gone through 1-2 cycles of induction therapy), followed by either bone marrow transplantation (BMT) or consolidation therapy.\n* Women of child-bearing potential must agree to undergo a urine pregnancy screening to prevent imaging of pregnant patients. A female of child-bearing potential is any woman (regardless of sexual orientation, having undergone a tubal ligation, or remaining celibate by choice) who meets the following criteria: 1) Has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 2) Has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months).\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Subjects may not be receiving any other investigational agents for the treatment of the cancer under study.\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that, in the opinion of the investigator, would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* Subjects must not be pregnant or nursing; since pregnancy is a contraindication to administration of gadolinium-based contrast agents. Furthermore, there is a potential for congenital abnormalities and the potential to harm nursing infants, associated with FDG-PET.\n* Any contraindication to MRI per Radiology Department's routine protocol, e.g. MRI-incompatible objects, including but not limited to medical devices and other foreign bodies.\n* Known severe allergic reaction to Gadolinium-based contrast agents.\n* Patients with uncontrollable claustrophobia, severe lower back pain, and uncontrollable tremors, to the point that it would render them unable to tolerate an MRI study.",
