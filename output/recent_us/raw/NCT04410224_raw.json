Participants will be screened for exercise participation using the Physical Activities Readiness Questionnaire + which is used as a screening tool for all ages to identify risk factors that would clear someone for participation in moderate physical exercise.\n* Those with dementia will be excluded because there are self-report questionnaires in this study. This will be identified using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment and a score at or below a 21. Participants with mild cognitive impairment and no impairment will be included.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 30 Years\nMust have maximum age of 85 Years",
