Viral load must be undetectable. HIV-infected patients on effective anti-retroviral therapy with undetectable viral load within 6 months are eligible for this trial\n* Meets other institutional and federal requirements for infectious disease titer requirements (Note Infectious disease testing to be performed within 28 days prior to day 1 of protocol therapy)\n* Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP): negative serum pregnancy test\n* Agreement by females of childbearing potential must agree to either abstain from heterosexual intercourse or to use two effective methods of birth control simultaneously (effective methods described below). The time period for effective contraceptive requirements begins ≥ 28 days prior to initiating tazemetostat and for the course of the study treatment period through at least 6 months after the last dose of tazemetostat, 4 months after the last dose of epcoritamab, or 4 months after the last dose of tocilizumab (if applicable), whichever is longer. Childbearing potential is defined as not being surgically sterilized (men and women) or have not been free from menses for > 1 year (women only). Two effective methods includes one highly effective method and one barrier method.\n\n  * Highly effective methods:\n\n    * Intrauterine device (IUD)\n    * Intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS)\n    * Hormonal (stopping ovulation with two drugs [estrogen and progesterone]: oral, within the vagina, or on/under the skin; stopping ovulation with one drug progesterone-only: oral, injected, or on/under the skin). NOTE: Due to the potential of tazemetostat interference with hormonal contraception methods, use of these method requires that you add a barrier method of contraception (preferably male condom)\n    * Bilateral tubal ligation\n    * Partner's vasectomy (if medically confirmed there are no live sperm and sole sexual partner)\n  * Barrier methods:\n\n    * Male latex or synthetic condom\n    * Diaphragm\n    * Cervical cap\n* Agreement by males to either practice complete abstinence or agree to use a latex or synthetic condom, even with a successful vasectomy (medically confirmed azoospermia), during sexual contact with a female of childbearing potential from first dose of study drug, during study treatment (including during dose interruptions), and for 3 months after study drug discontinuation. NOTE: Male subjects must not donate semen or sperm from first dose of tazemetostat, during study treatment (including during dose interruptions), and for 3 months after discontinuation of tazemetostat\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",

Patients who fit this description must have a negative molecular (e.g., PCR) test, or 2 negative antigen test results at least 24 hours apart, to rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection\n* Clinically significant uncontrolled illness\n* Uncontrolled active systemic infection\n* Any prior history of myeloid malignancies, including myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) or any prior history of T lymphoblastic leukemia (T-LBL)/T acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) or B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL)\n* Other active malignancy. Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen are eligible for this trial. Exceptions are:\n\n  * Malignancy treated with curative intent and no known active disease present for ≥ 3 years prior to initiation of therapy on current study\n  * Adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer or lentigo maligna (melanoma in situ) without evidence of disease\n  * Adequately treated in situ carcinomas (e.g., breast, cervical, esophageal, etc.) without evidence of disease\n  * Asymptomatic prostate cancer managed with \"watch and wait\" strategy or hormonal therapy\n* Inability to take oral medication or have malabsorption syndrome or any other uncontrolled gastrointestinal condition (e.g., nausea, diarrhea, vomiting) that might impair the bioavailability of tazemetostat\n* Females only: Pregnant or breastfeeding\n* Any other condition that would, in the investigator's judgment, contraindicate the patient's participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns with clinical study procedures\n* Prospective participants who, in the opinion of the investigator, may not be able to comply with all study procedures (including compliance issues related to feasibility/logistics)",
