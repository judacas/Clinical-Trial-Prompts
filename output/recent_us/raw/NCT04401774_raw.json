    "official_title": "An Open-Label Study to Assess the Safety and Efficacy of Remdesivir for Treatment of Symptomatic Laboratory-Confirmed Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection of the Upper Respiratory Tract in Patients Receiving Cellular or Bispecific Antibody Therapies",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Aged ≥ 18 years\n* Willing and able to provide written informed consent, or with a legal representative who can provide informed consent (where locally approved)\n* RSV confirmed by local lab testing via nucleic acid amplification test (e.g. polymerase chain reaction [PCR] or respiratory viral panel [RVP]) using an upper respiratory tract sample collected within the 5 days prior to day 1 (RDV dosing)\n* Symptomatic RSV infection of the upper respiratory tract, with symptom onset and positive microbiologic testing within the 5 days prior to day 1 (RDV dosing). Symptomatic RSV infection is defined as having new upper respiratory symptom(s) or worsening of a pre-existing upper respiratory symptom (if chronic and associated with a previously existing diagnosis, such as chronic lung disease, chronic rhinorrhea, or seasonal allergies)\n* Have one of the following underlying diseases and/or received one of the following treatments relative to RSV diagnosis date:\n\n  * Received allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) with any conditioning regimen within 1 year\n  * Received autologous HCT with any conditioning regimen within 3 months\n  * Received Chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy (CARTx) within 3 months\n  * Have multiple myeloma (MM) and received bispecific antibody therapy (bsAb) within 3 months\n  * Have lymphoma and received bsAb within 3 months\n* Categorized as moderate-risk (overall score 3-6) or high-risk (overall score 7-12) per an adapted version of the Immunodeficiency Scoring Index (ISI) for RSV, as below, relative to the day of RSV diagnosis:\n\n  * 1 point:\n\n    * Recent (within the prior 30 days) allogeneic HCT, autologous HCT, or CARTx\n    * Corticosteroids within the prior 30 days for management of graft versus host disease (GVHD) or cytokine release syndrome (CRS) or immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS).\n  * 2 points:\n\n    * Age ≥ 40 years\n  * 3 points:\n\n    * Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) < 500 cells/μL within the prior 7 days\n    * Absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) < 200 cells/µL within the prior 7 days\n* Oxygen saturation (SpO2) 92% or greater on room air and at rest (to be measured after participant has rested in a quiet room for ≥ 2 minutes, with oxygen [O2] saturation probe on finger or earlobe for ≥ 1 minute, with saturation reading remaining ≥ 92%) at screening\n* Willingness to take study drug and complete necessary study procedures\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Received or receiving an approved or authorized direct-acting antiviral therapy with potential efficacy against RSV (e.g. ribavirin) for ≥ 24 hours within the prior 7 days\n* Received or receiving investigational direct-acting antiviral therapies against RSV for the current RSV episode\n* Received any investigational monoclonal anti-RSV antibodies within < 4 months or < 5 half-lives, whichever is longer, before screening\n* Received an RSV vaccine after cellular therapy or after starting the current antitumor therapeutic regimen\n* Participation in any other concurrent clinical trial of an experimental treatment for RSV, including RSV vaccines\n* Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) > 10 times the upper limit of normal within 7 days prior to screening\n* New lower respiratory tract radiographic abnormalities after RSV-associated symptom onset that are suspected to be due to RSV\n* Unable to tolerate nasal sampling required for this study, as determined by the investigator (e.g., history of significant epistaxis, nasopharyngeal anatomical abnormalities, nasal or sinus surgery)\n* A life expectancy of three months or less, as determined by the investigator\n* Pregnant, as determined by a Point-of-Care urine pregnancy test or reported by the patient or their electronic health record within 7 days of screening\n* Receiving, requiring, or expected to require supplemental oxygen for RSV-related illness or SpO2 < 92% at rest < 24 hours prior to study drug administration\n* Previous infection and/or hospitalization for RSV, or previous infection with, treatment for, or hospitalization for another respiratory viral infection within 28 days prior to screening\n* Documented positive test for other respiratory viruses concomitantly (limited to influenza, parainfluenza, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, or coronavirus [including SARS-CoV-2]) ≤ 7 days prior to screening, as determined by local testing (additional testing not required)\n* Clinically significant bacteremia or fungemia ≤ 7 days prior to screening and not adequately treated, as determined by the investigator\n* Clinically significant bacterial, fungal, or viral pneumonia within two (2) weeks prior to screening and not adequately treated, as determined by the investigator\n* Clinically significant symptoms of CRS or ICANS within the prior 72 hours before screening that is not adequately controlled, as determined by the investigator\n* Any inability to take study drug or comply with study procedures that, in the opinion of the investigator, would make the participant unsuitable for the study\n* Known hypersensitivity or allergy to the study drug, its metabolites, or formulation excipients",
