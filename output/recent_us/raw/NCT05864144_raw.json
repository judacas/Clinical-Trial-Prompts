    "inclusion_criteria": "* INCLUSION CRITIERIA:\n\nAdult subjects (more than 18 years of age) will be included in this study if they:\n\n1. Have a known or suspected tumor of the pituitary gland that requires surgical resection through a transsphenoidal approach. There is no size restriction. Invasion of surrounding anatomical structures by the pituitary tumor will not be ground for screen failure/withdrawal from study.\n2. Are enrolled in 03-N-0164, Evaluation and Treatment of Neurosurgical Disorders. If not enrolled, subjects will not be able to be included in the study as clinical and research procedures are done under the 03-N-0164 protocol.\n3. Are able to provide written consent.\n4. NIH employees are included in the study.\n\nEXCLUSION CRITIERIA:\n\nSubjects will be excluded from this study if they:\n\n1. Are unable to fit the intra-operative MRI table due to size or weight restrictions i.e morbid obesity. Patients will be anaesthetized and therefore claustrophobia will not be ground for screen failure/withdrawal from study.\n2. Have an absolute contraindication to MRI imaging or MRI contrast agent according to Rad&IS screening including devices or conditions.\n3. Have a variant anatomy which may, in the judgment of the operating neurosurgeon, add unacceptable risk to the placement of the endosphenoidal coil (e.g. small size of facial bones and nasal passages, unaerated sphenoid sinus etc.).\n4. Are pregnant or nursing.\n5. Patients older than 85 years of age. Cushing disease is rare in the older population.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 85 Years",
