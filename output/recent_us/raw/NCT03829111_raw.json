Exceptions: basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical cancer.\n* Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Exceptions: subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging =< 4 weeks prior to registration and any neurologic symptoms have returned to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using steroids for at least =< 7 days prior to registration. This exception does not include carcinomatous meningitis which is excluded regardless of clinical stability.\n* Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs). Note: Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment.\n* Has a history of non-infectious pneumonitis that required steroids or has current pneumonitis.\n* Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.\n* Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.\n* Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial.\n* Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the trial, starting with the screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.\n* Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent.\n* Has a known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).\n* Has known active hepatitis B (e.g., hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., hepatitis C virus [HCV] ribonucleic acid [RNA] [qualitative] is detected).\n* Has received a live vaccine =< 30 days prior to registration.\n\n  * Note: Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist) are live attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.\n* Sezary syndrome patients with high blood burden requiring immediate cytoreduction.",
