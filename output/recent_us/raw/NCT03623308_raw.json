    "exclusion_criteria": "* Active or uncontrolled intercurrent illness, including but not limited to ongoing or active infections, coagulation disorders or other major medical illnesses of the cardiovascular, respiratory or immune system. Principal investigator (PI) or his/her designee shall make the final determination regarding appropriateness of enrollment.\n* Patients with active viral hepatitis.\n* Patients who have a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 45% at screening.\n* Patients with a history of prior adoptive cell therapies.\n* Persistent prior therapy-related toxicities greater than grade 2 according to Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v)4.03, except for peripheral neuropathy, alopecia, or vitiligo prior to enrollment.\n\n  * Patients who have had a documented grade 2 or greater diarrhea or colitis due to previous immunotherapy must have been asymptomatic for at least 6 months or had a normal colonoscopy post checkpoint treatment, by visual assessment, prior to enrollment.\n  * Patients with immunotherapy-related endocrinopathies (e.g. hypothyroidism or hypopituitarism, who are stable on hormonal substitution) and controlled with hormonal replacement, are allowed.\n* Primary immunodeficiency.\n* History of organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplant.\n* Chronic steroid therapy, however prednisone or its equivalent is allowed at =< 10 mg/day.\n* Patients who are pregnant or nursing.\n* Presence of a significant psychiatric disease, which in the opinion of the principal investigator or his/her designee, would prevent adequate informed consent.\n* History of clinically significant autoimmune disease including active, known, or suspected autoimmune disease. Subjects with resolved side effects from prior checkpoint inhibitor therapy, vitiligo, psoriasis, type 1 diabetes or resolved childhood asthma/atopy would be an exception to this rule. Subjects that require intermittent use of bronchodilators or local steroid injections would not be excluded. Subjects with hypothyroidism stable on hormone replacement or Sjogren's syndrome will not be excluded.\n* History of clinically significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, interstitial lung disease, or other chronic lung disease.\n* History of a second malignancy (diagnosed in the last 5 years). Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or in situ cervical cancer that has undergone potentially curative therapy. For the thyroid cancer cohort, subjects have a higher likelihood of prior cancers. Therefore, for this cohort, history of prior thyroid cancer or other indolent cancers is not considered exclusionary if in the opinion of the treating physician such cancers are indolent or unlikely to affect the overall prognosis based on the active thyroid cancer.\n* History of known active central nervous system metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least four weeks prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using steroids for at least 7 days prior to initiation of lymphodepletion.\n* Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the initiation of lymphodepletion.\n* Patients who have a contraindication to or history of hypersensitivity reaction to any components or excipients of the TIL therapy or the other study drugs: non-myeloablative-lymphodepletion (NMA-LD) (cyclophosphamide, mesna, and fludarabine); IL-2; antibiotics of the aminoglycoside group (i.e., streptomycin, gentamicin); any component of the TIL infusion product formulation including human serum albumin (HSA), IL-2, and dextran-40, nivolumab or ipilimumab.\n* Any other condition that in the investigator's judgement would significantly increase the risks of participation.",
