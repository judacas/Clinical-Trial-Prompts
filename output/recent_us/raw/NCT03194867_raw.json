Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least 4 weeks prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using steroids for at least 7 days prior to trial treatment. This exception does not include carcinomatous meningitis which is excluded regardless of clinical stability.\n* Concomitant anticoagulation with oral anticoagulants except for those specified below.\n\nAllowed anticoagulants are the following:\n\n* Prophylactic use of low-dose aspirin for cardioprotection (per local applicable guidelines) is permitted.\n* Low-dose low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) are permitted.\n* Therapeutic doses of LMWH or anticoagulation with direct factor Xa inhibitors rivaroxaban, edoxaban, or apixaban is allowed in subjects without known brain metastases who are on a stable dose of the anticoagulant for at least 1 week before the first dose of study treatment without, clinically significant hemorrhagic complications from the anticoagulation regimen or the tumor.\n\n  * The subject has prothrombin time (PT)/INR or partial thromboplastin time (PTT) test ≥ 1.3 × ULN within 14 days before the first dose of study treatment.\n  * The subject has uncontrolled, significant intercurrent or recent illness including, but not limited to, the following conditions:\n* Cardiovascular disorders:\n\n  * Ongoing congestive heart failure exacerbation or New York Heart Association Class 4, unstable angina pectoris, serious cardiac arrhythmias.\n  * Uncontrolled hypertension defined as sustained blood pressure (BP) > 150 mm Hg systolic or > 100 mm Hg diastolic despite optimal antihypertensive treatment. Uncontrolled hypertension needs to be determined based on persistently high blood pressure readings over more than 24 hours and should NOT be based on the blood pressure readings from one clinic visit. Blood pressure readings done at home or by primary care providers are acceptable. If a blood pressure reading on the day of screening is high, but there are documented acceptable ( ≤150 mm Hg systolic and ≤100 mm Hg diastolic) blood pressure readings prior to or after the screening visit (with or without the use of anti-hypertensive medications), patient will not be considered to have uncontrolled hypertension.\n  * Stroke (including transient ischemic attack [TIA]), myocardial infarction (MI), or other ischemic event, or symptomatic thromboembolic event (eg, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism) occurring less than or equal to 6 months before first dose of cabozantinib. [Note: Subjects with a diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or incidentally detected asympotmatic and sub-segmental pulmonary embolism (PE) on routine scans are allowed if on a stable dose of anti-coagulation for at least 1 week before first dose of study treatment].\n\n    * Clinically significant hematuria, hematemesis, or hemoptysis of > 0.5 teaspoon (2.5 ml) of red blood, or other history of significant bleeding (eg, pulmonary hemorrhage) within 12 weeks before first dose.\n* Gastrointestinal (GI) disorders including those associated with a high risk of perforation or fistula formation:\n\n  * The subject has evidence of tumor invading the GI tract, active peptic ulcer disease, inflammatory bowel disease (eg, Crohn's disease), diverticulitis, cholecystitis, symptomatic cholangitis or appendicitis, acute pancreatitis, acute obstruction of the pancreatic duct or common bile duct, or gastric outlet obstruction.\n  * Abdominal fistula, GI perforation, bowel obstruction, or intra-abdominal abscess within 6 months before first dose.\n\nNote: Complete healing of an intra-abdominal abscess must be confirmed before first dose.\n\n* Cavitating pulmonary lesion(s) or known endotracheal or endobronchial disease manifestation.\n* Lesions invading or encasing any major blood vessels.\n* Other clinically significant disorders that would preclude safe study participation per investigator clinical judgement.\n\n  * Serious non-healing wound/ulcer/bone fracture.\n  * Uncompensated/symptomatic hypothyroidism.\n  * Moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C).\n\n    * Other severe acute or chronic medical conditions including immune colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, immune pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis or psychiatric conditions including recent (within the past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior; or laboratory abnormalities that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study treatment administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study.\n    * Major surgery (eg, GI surgery, removal or biopsy of brain metastasis) within 8 weeks before first dose of study treatment.
