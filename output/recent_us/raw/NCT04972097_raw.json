Life expectancy ≥ 6 months.\n9. ≥ 4 weeks since any major surgery, completion of radiation therapy, or completion of all prior systemic anticancer therapy (adequately recovered from the acute toxicities of any prior therapy).\n10. Female subjects of childbearing potential should have a negative serum pregnancy (beta-human chorionic gonadotropin) within 7 days prior to receiving the first dose of the trial treatment and should not be lactating.\n11. Female subjects of childbearing potential must be willing to use an adequate method of contraception for the course of the study through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy.\n12. Male subjects of childbearing potential must agree to use an adequate method of contraception for the course of the study through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Unwilling or unable to comply with the study protocol.\n2. Subjects for who bone metastases are the only available non-target lesions for abscopal effect evaluation.\n3. Subjects with tumors for which SBRT is not considered appropriate standard therapy. This includes subjects with target lesions less than 1 cm in diameter and those with large central lung lesions.\n4. Currently participating and receiving study therapy or has participated in a study of an investigational agent and received study therapy or used an investigational device within 4 weeks of the first dose of trial treatment.\n5. Diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment.\n6. Known history of active tuberculosis (Bacillus Tuberculosis).\n7. Known or suspected hypersensitivity to pembrolizumab or any of its excipients or any component of the proposed regimen (gene vector/valacyclovir).\n8. Known gallbladder or bile duct disease (i.e., infection or cholecystitis) or acute or chronic pancreatitis.\n9. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of ≥2 or oxygen dependence (e.g., advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).\n10. Inability to swallow food or any condition of the upper gastrointestinal tract that precludes administration of oral medications (valacyclovir).\n11. Congestive heart failure: New York Association class III or IV heart failure or unstable angina.\n12. Sustained or clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias including sustained ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, clinically significant bradycardia, advanced heart block (Mobitz II or higher atrioventricular nodal block), prolonged corrected QT interval (longer than 470 milliseconds), or history of acute myocardial infarction.\n13. Concomitant disease(s) that could prolong QT such as autonomic neuropathy (caused by diabetes or Parkinson's disease), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), cirrhosis, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, or cardiac failure.\n14. History of syncope or family history of idiopathic sudden death.\n15. Targeted small molecule therapy or monoclonal antibody or radiation therapy within 3 weeks prior to study Day 0 or has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to a previously administered agent.\n\n    - Note: Subjects with ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy are an exception to this criterion and may qualify for the study.\n16. Known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment. Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical cancer.\n17. Known active central nervous system metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least 4 weeks prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using steroids for at least 7 days prior to trial treatment. This exception does not include carcinomatous meningitis, which is excluded regardless of clinical stability.\n18. Active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e., with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment.\n19. History of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or current pneumonitis.\n20. Active infection requiring systemic therapy.\n21. History or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.\n22. Known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial.\n23. Pregnant or breastfeeding, expecting to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the trial, starting with the prescreening or screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment, or is unwilling to practice an effective method of birth control. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to administration of trial treatment.\n24. Prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent (TNBC cohort only).\n25. Prior treatment with immunomodulatory therapy or immunotherapy (TNBC cohort only).\n26.

History of liver disease such as cirrhosis or known active hepatitis B (e.g., hepatitis B surface antigen reactive) or hepatitis C (e.g., hepatitis C virus RNA [qualitative] is detected).\n30. History of or current alcohol misuse/abuse within the past 12 months.\n31. Major surgery within 4 weeks prior to study enrollment.\n32. Received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of trial therapy. Note: Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.",
