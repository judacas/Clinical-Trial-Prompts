    "official_title": "Comparative Effectiveness of Split-Dose Colonoscopy Bowel Preparation Regimens",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* > 18 years of age, and\n* being scheduled for outpatient elective screening, surveillance or diagnostic colonoscopies, and\n* the provider ordering the colonoscopy giving permission to enroll the patient.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Patients who are <18 years\n* undergoing inpatient colonoscopy\n* those with contra-indications to receiving the standard 4L PEG-ELS colonoscopy bowel preparation (e.g., allergy to PEG) will be excluded\n* Those with a preference for a specific bowel preparation will be excluded.\n\n  * The investigators are excluding inpatient colonoscopies because they account for a very small fraction of the total colonoscopies performed.\n  * Also, inpatient colonoscopies are often performed for urgent reasons such that rapid bowel preparation procedures are followed.\n* In addition, because the objective of inpatient colonoscopy is often not to look for small polyps, the threshold for \"adequate\" bowel preparation quality might be different from that for outpatient procedures.\n* In addition, for patients undergoing more than 1 colonoscopy during the study period, only their first colonoscopy will be included in the primary analysis.\n* Patients who are undergoing a repeat colonoscopy for to a recent inadequate colonoscopy examination with poor bowel preparation will be excluded.",
