    "official_title": "Phase 2 Study of Personalized r-ATG Dosing to Improve Survival Through Enhanced Immune Reconstitution in Pediatric and Adult Patients Undergoing Ex-vivo CD34-Selected Allogeneic-HCT (PRAISE-IR)",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Patients receiving first peripheral blood mobilized ex-vivo CD34-selected T cell depleted allo-HCT for the following hematologic malignant conditions:\n\n  * Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with intermediate or high-risk features in CR1 or Relapse AML in ≥ CR2.\n  * Must have MRD <5% (flow cytometry, molecular and/or cytogenetics accepted).\n  * Acute leukemias of ambiguous lineage in ≥ CR1.\n  * Must have MRD <5% (flow cytometry, molecular and/or cytogenetics accepted).\n  * Acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) in CR1 with clinical, flow cytometric, or molecular features indicating a high risk for relapse, or ALL in ≥ CR2.\n  * Adult Patients - recommended but not required to be MRDnegative (by flow cytometry, molecular and/or cytogenetics).\n  * Pediatric Patients - Must be MRD-negative by flow cytometry, molecular and/or cytogenetics.\n  * Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) with least one of the following:\n  * Revised International Prognostic Scoring System risk score of intermediate or higher at the time of transplant evaluation.\n  * Life-threatening cytopenia.\n  * Karyotype or genomic changes that indicate high risk for progression to acute myelogenous leukemia, including abnormalities of chromosome 7 or 3, mutations of TP53, or complex or monosomal karyotype.\n  * Therapy related disease or disease evolving from other malignant processes.\n* Able to tolerate cytoreduction\n* Patients age:\n\n  * Regimen A: 4 - 60 years\n  * Regimen B - no age restriction\n* Adequate organ function is required, defined as follows:\n\n  * Hepatic: Serum bilirubin ≤ 2 mg/dL, unless benign congenital hyperbilirubinemia. Patients with hyperbilirubinemia related to paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria or other hemolytic disorders are eligible with PI approval.\n  * Hepatic: AST, ALT, and alkaline phosphatase < 2.5 times the upper limit of normal unless thought to be disease-related.\n  * Renal: serum creatinine <1.5x normal for age. If serum creatinine is outside the normal range, then CrCl > 50 mL/min/1.73m2 (calculated or estimated) or GFR (mL/min/1.72m2) >30% of predicted normal for age.\n* Normal GFR by Age\n\n  * 1 week 40.6 + / - 14.8\n  * 2 - 8 weeks 65.8 + / - 24.8\n\n    °> 8 weeks 95.7 +/- 21.7\n  * 2 - 12 years 133 +/- 27\n  * 13 - 21 years (males) 140 +/- 30\n  * 13 - 21 years (females) 126.0 + / - 22.0\n* Cardiac: LVEF ≥ 50% by MUGA or resting echocardiogram.\n* Pulmonary: Pulmonary function testing (FEV1 and corrected DLCO) ≥ 50% predicted (pediatric patients unable to complete PFTs will need oxygen saturation as recorded by pulse oximetry of ≥92% on room air).\n* Adequate performance status:\n\n  * Age ≥ 16 years: ECOG ≤ 1 or Karnofsky 70%\n  * Age < 16 years: Lansky 70%\n* Each patient must be willing to participate as a research subject and must sign an informed consent form or legal guardian with assent as appropriate.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 4 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Patients with active extramedullary disease.\n* Patients with active central nervous system malignancy.\n* Uncontrolled infection at the time of allo-HCT.\n* Patients who have undergone previous allo-HCT.\n* Patient seropositivity for HIV I/II and/or HTLV I/II.\n* Females who are pregnant or breastfeeding.\n* Patients unwilling to use contraception during the study period.\n* Patient or parent or guardian unable to give informed consent or unable to comply with the treatment protocol including research tests.\n\nDonor Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Related or Unrelated Donors:\n\n  °8/8 HLA matched at A, B, C, and DRB1 loci, as tested by DNA analysis.\n* Able to provide informed consent for the donation process per institutional standards.\n* Meet standard criteria for donor collection (e.g. National Marrow Donor Program Guidelines or collecting center guidelines as approved by treating physician).\n* Provide GSCF mobilized peripheral blood stem cells",
