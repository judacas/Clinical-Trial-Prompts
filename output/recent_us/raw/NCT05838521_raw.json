These patients should be discussed with the PI of the study for final approval).\n11. Serum bilirubin <1.5 mg/dl and Cr Clearance ≥ 60 mL/min by Cockroft-Gault Formula (Appendix VIII) or by >=60 ml/min by 24 hour urine Cr clearance test (Appendix VIII) , AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) < 2.5 x upper limit of normal or < 5 x upper limit of normal if hepatic metastases are present. Gilbert's disease is allowed.\n12. Women of childbearing potential (WOBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test. WOBP and males must be willing to use highly effective methods of birth control. Woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) who are sexually active must use highly effective methods of contraception during treatment and for 2 days after the last dose of acalabrutinib and for 12 months following the last dose of rituximab and 6 months after the completion of CAR T infusion. For male patients with a pregnant or non-pregnant WOCBP partner, should use barrier contraception, during treatment and for 2 days after the last dose of acalabrutinib and for 1 month following the last dose of rituximab and 6 months after the completion of CAR T infusion even if they have had a successful vasectomy. (see Appendix VII).\n13. Cardiology cleared for receiving acalabrutinib and CART\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA PART 1:\n\n1. Isolated bone marrow or GI only disease MCL patients and/or lack of measurable disease.\n2. Pregnant or breast-feeding females.\n3.

Current life-threatening illness, medical condition, or organ system dysfunction which, in the Investigator's opinion, could compromise the subject's safety or put the study at risk.\n6. Known HIV infection.\n7. Patients who do not meet high risk features as indicated above. Hepatitis B or C serologic status: subjects who are hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) positive and who are hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) negative will need to have a negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and must be willing to undergo DNA PCR testing during the study to be eligible. Those who are HBsAg positive or hepatitis B PCR positive will be excluded. Subjects who are hepatitis C antibody positive will need to have a negative PCR result to be eligible. Those who are hepatitis C PCR positive will be excluded.\n8. Prior malignancy (or any other malignancy requiring active treatment), except for adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, in situ ca prostate, in situ melanoma (> 5 mm margins) or other cancer from which the subject has been disease free for ≥ 3 years or which will not limit survival to < 3 years.\n9.

Patient who exhibit active uncontrolled infection on AR alone will not be excluded but would await adequate infection control and then get CAR T, as long as they have evidence of disease.\n25. Vaccinated with live, attenuated vaccines within 6 weeks of first dose of study drug.\n26.
