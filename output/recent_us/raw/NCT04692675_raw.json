    "exclusion_criteria": "* Active or chronic infection within 7 days prior to study entry\n* Presence of non-healing fracture\n\n  * Note: patients with pathologic fracture related to tumor are eligible\n* Use of corticosteroids within 21 days of enrollment, except in the following situations:\n\n  * Physiologic steroid replacement for adrenal insufficiency\n  * Topical, ocular, intra-articular, intranasal, or inhaled corticosteroid with minimal systemic absorption\n  * Short course (=< 7 days) of corticosteroid prescribed prophylactically (eg, for contrast dye allergy) or for the treatment of a non-autoimmune condition (eg, delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction caused by contact allergen), or exacerbation of asthma\n* Patients with gastrointestinal conditions that might predispose for drug intolerability or poor drug absorption (e.g., inability to take oral medication, prior surgical procedures affecting absorption (e.g., gastric bypass), malabsorption syndrome, and active peptic ulcer disease)\n* Patients with ulcerative colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, or a partial or complete small bowel obstruction\n* Known active infection with hepatitis B, hepatitis C or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\n* Patients with a prior history of malignancy, with the exceptions of desmoid tumor(s) and non-melanoma skin cancer, who are not in remission for more than 3 years\n* Patients who are unable to swallow tablets. Tablets must not be crushed or chewed. Administration of nirogacestat via gastrostomy tube or nasogastric tube is not allowed\n* Patients who in the opinion of the investigator may not be able to comply with the safety monitoring requirements of the study\n* Sexually active female patients of reproductive potential who have not agreed to use 1 method of highly effective contraceptive (including copper-containing intrauterine device, condom with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository, bilateral tubal ligation, established use of inserted, injected or implanted hormonal method of contraception, abstinence, or male sterilization) for the duration of their study participation and for at least 6 months after last dose of nirogacestat. A second form of contraception (i.e. barrier method) is required for patients who are using hormonal contraception as nirogacestat may reduce the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives\n* Sexually active male patients of reproductive potential who have not agreed to use a condom and their female partner who have not agreed to use one of the highly effective methods of contraception mentioned above during treatment and for at least 90 days after the last dose of nirogacestat\n* Female patients who are breastfeeding\n* Female patients who are pregnant. These patients are excluded because there is no available information regarding the effects of nirogacestat on the developing human fetus and inhibition of gamma-secretase is known to be teratogenic\n* Female patients of childbearing potential unless a negative pregnancy test result has been obtained",
