HIV-infected patients must be on anti-retroviral therapy (ART) and have a well-controlled HIV infection/disease defined as:\n\na Patients on ART must have a CD4+ T-cell count >350 cells/mm3 at time of screening b Patients on ART must have achieved and maintained virologic suppression defined as confirmed HIV RNA level below 50 copies/mL or the lower limit of qualification (below the limit of detection) using the locally available assay at the time of screening and for at least 12 weeks prior to first dose of trial medication (Day 1) c Patients on ART must have been on a stable regimen, without changes in drugs or dose modification, for at least 4 weeks prior to first dose of trial medication (Day 1) 11. Patients who are hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive are eligible if they have received hepatitis B (HBV) antiviral therapy for at least 4 weeks and have undetectable HBV viral load prior to start of trial intervention.\n\nNote: Patients should remain on anti-viral therapy throughout trial intervention and follow local guidelines for HBV anti-viral therapy after completion of trial intervention.\n\nHepatitis B screening tests are not required unless:\n\n* Known history of HBV infection\n* Mandated by local health authority. 12. Patients with a history of hepatitis C (HCV) infection are eligible if HCV viral load is undetectable at screening.\n\nNote: Patients must have completed curative antiviral therapy at least 4 weeks prior to start of trial intervention.\n\nHepatitis C screening tests are not required unless:\n\n* Known history of HCV infection\n* Mandated by local health authority.\n\nMelanoma-specific exclusion criteria:\n\n* Current or prior history of uveal, mucosal, or acral melanoma\n* Oligometastatic stage IV melanoma\n* History of in-transit metastases within the last 6 months\n* Prior therapy targeting BRAF and/or MEK\n\nSCCHN-specific exclusion criteria:\n\n• Nasopharyngeal cancer, unknown primary, nasal cavity or paranasal sinus carcinoma\n\nExclusion criteria applicable across cohorts:\n\nIn addition, patients meeting any of the following criteria must be excluded:\n\n1.

Patients with grade ≤2 neuropathy are eligible for the trial. Patients with endocrine-related AEs grade ≤2 requiring treatment or hormone replacement are also eligible.\n   * Note: If the patient has had major surgery, the patient must have recovered adequately from the procedure and/or complications from the surgery prior to starting trial treatment.\n5.

Known history of HBV or HCV infection\n    2. Mandated by local health authority. Patients with a history of hepatitis will be screened using serology to confirm status.\n15.
