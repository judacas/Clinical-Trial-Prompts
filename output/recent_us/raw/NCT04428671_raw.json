The method of contraception must be a barrier method plus a hormonal method to prevent pregnancy.\n    3. Participants must agree to continue contraception throughout the study and continuing through 3 months after the last dose of study drug. Note: If the childbearing potential changes after start of the study (e.g., woman who is not heterosexually active becomes active, premenarchal woman experiences menarche) the woman must begin a highly effective method of birth control, as described above.\n    4. A woman of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine (b- human chorionic gonadotropin [b-hCG]) at Screening.\n    5. A woman must agree not to donate eggs (ova, oocytes) for the purposes of assisted reproduction during the study and for 6 months after receiving the last dose of study drug.\n    6.

A man who is sexually active with a woman of childbearing potential must agree to use a condom with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository and his partner must also be practicing a highly effective method of contraception (i.e., established use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception; placement of an intrauterine device [IUD] or intrauterine system [IUS]). If the subject is vasectomized, he must still use a condom (with or without spermicide), but his female partner is not required to use contraception. The subject must also not donate sperm during the study and for 6 months after receiving the last dose of study drug, even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy. True abstinence is acceptable when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Note: Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 90 Years",
