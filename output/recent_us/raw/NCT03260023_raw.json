Willing to refrain from using non-approved lotions or creams on the target site and surrounding area during the treatment period.\n7. Willing to refrain from exposure to excessive direct sunlight or ultraviolet light and to avoid the use of tanning parlors for the duration of the study.\n8.

Ability to follow study instructions and likely to complete all study requirements.\n9. Written informed consent obtained, including consent for tissue to be examined and stored by the Central Histology Lab.\n10. Written consent to allow photographs of the target BCC lesion to be used as part of the study data and documentation.\n11. For females of childbearing potential, a negative pregnancy test at screening and using an acceptable form of birth control (oral / implant/ injectable/ transdermal contraceptives, intrauterine device, condom, diaphragm, abstinence, or a monogamous relationship with a partner who has had a vasectomy).\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",

Histological evidence of infiltrative or other aggressive histological subtype growth patterns in the biopsy specimen.\n5. History of recurrence of the target BCC lesion.\n6. Evidence of dermatological disease or confounding skin condition with in 2 cm margin of the target BCC lesion, e.g., SCC, actinic keratosis, rosacea, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, eczema, xeroderma pigmentosa.\n7. Concurrent disease or treatment that suppresses the immune system;\n8. Patients with baseline QTC > 480 msec using Frederica's formula.\n9. Chronic medical condition that in the judgment of the investigator(s) would interfere with the performance of the study or would place the patient at undue risk.\n10.

Use of topical immunomodulators within 2 cm of the target BCC lesion within the 4 weeks prior to the screening period.\n16. Treatment with the following topical agents within 2 cm of the target BCC lesion within the 4 weeks prior to the screening visit: amino-levulinic acid, 5-fluorouracil, corticosteroids, retinoids, diclofenac, ingenol mebutate, or imiquimod.\n17. Treatment with liquid nitrogen, surgical excision (excluding diagnostic incisional biopsy) or curettage within 2 cm of the target BCC lesion during the 4 weeks prior to the screening visit.\n18. Evidence of current chronic alcohol or drug abuse.\n19. Current enrollment in an investigational drug or device study or participation in such a study within 4 weeks of the screening visit.\n20. In the investigator's opinion, evidence of unwillingness, or inability to follow the restrictions and requirements of the protocol and complete the study.\n21.
