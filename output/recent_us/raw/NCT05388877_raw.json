    "inclusion_criteria": "* Histologically confirmed HCC, which is unresectable, recurrent and/or metastatic.\n* GPC3-positive expression in HCC tumor cells confirmed by immunohistochemistry (IHC). To be eligible for Phase 2 (expansion phase) of the study, the subject's tumor biopsy sample (resection or needle core sample) must demonstrate that more than 50% of tumor cells exhibit at least 3+ GPC3 expression intensity.\n* Must have failed, or not tolerated, at least two (2) different anti-HCC systemic agents.\n* Life expectancy of at least 4 months per the Investigator's opinion.\n* Karnofsky Performance Scale of 70 or higher.\n* Measurable disease by RECIST v1.1. Previously treated lesions are allowed as long as there is a new confirmed measurable component.\n* Child-Pugh score of A6 or better.\n* Adequate organ function.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Pre-existing illness (e.g., symptomatic congestive heart failure) that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* Active, uncontrolled systemic bacterial, fungal, or viral infection. Subjects with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), hepatitis B, or hepatitis C are eligible provided their infection is being treated and the viral load is controlled.\n* Active malignancy (other than HCC), with the exception of cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) or any malignancy without any organ involvement and with an expected survival â‰¥ 3 years without any treatment (exception: hormone/androgen- deprivation therapy).\n* Currently receiving or ending (< 14 days from date of consent) liver tumor-directed therapy (e.g., radiation, ablation, embolization), or hepatic surgery.\n* Concurrently receiving other investigational agents, biological, chemical, or radiation therapies, while participating in the study.\n* Active autoimmune disease requiring therapy.\n* Compromised circulation in the main portal vein, hepatic vein, or vena cava due to obstruction.\n* History of organ transplant.\n* Advanced HCC involving greater than half (50%) of the liver.",
