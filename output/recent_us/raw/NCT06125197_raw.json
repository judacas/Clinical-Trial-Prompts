LVEF ≥50% as assessed by echocardiogram (ECHO) or multi-gated acquisition (MUGA) scan documented within 3weeks prior to study treatment initiation.\n11. For patients of childbearing potential, as defined in Section 4.3, the following stipulations apply:\n\n    * Must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity of 25 mIU/mL or equivalent units of beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [β-hCG]) result within 3 days prior to study treatment initiation. A patient with a false positive result and documented verification that the patient is not pregnant will be eligible.\n    * Must agree not to try to become pregnant during the study and for at least 7 months after the final dose of study treatment\n    * Must agree not to breastfeed or donate ova starting at the time of informed consent and continuing through the study and for 7 months after the final dose of study treatment\n    * If sexually active in a way that could lead to pregnancy, must consistently use highly effective methods of birth control (i.e., methods that achieve a failure rate of <1% per year when used consistently and correctly) starting at the time of informed consent and continuing throughout the study and for at least 7 months after the final dose of study treatment.\n\n    Highly effective methods of birth control include:\n\n    i. Intrauterine device ii. Bilateral tubal occlusion/ligation iii. Vasectomized partner iv. Sexual abstinence when it is the preferred and usual lifestyle choice of the patient.\n12. For patients who can father children, the following stipulations apply:\n\n    * Must agree not to donate sperm starting at the time of informed consent and continuing throughout the study and for at least 7 months after the final dose of study treatment\n    * If sexually active with a person of childbearing potential in a way that could lead to pregnancy, must consistently use a barrier method of birth control starting at the time of informed consent and continuing throughout the study and for at least 7 months after the final dose of study treatment\n    * If sexually active with a person who is pregnant or breastfeeding, must consistently use a barrier method of birth control starting at the time of informed consent and continuing throughout the study and for at least 7 months after the final dose of study treatment.\n13. The patient must provide written informed consent.\n14. Must be willing to undergo biopsy as required by the study, if clinically considered safe and feasible by the investigator.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Patients must not have any of the following on the screening brain MRI:\n\n   * Any untreated brain lesions >3.0 cm in size\n   * Any brain lesion thought to require immediate local therapy, including (but not limited to) a lesion in an anatomic site where increase in size or possible treatment-related edema may pose risk to the patient (e.g., brainstem lesions). Patients who undergo local treatment for such lesions may still be eligible for the study based on inclusion criteria #2.\n2.
