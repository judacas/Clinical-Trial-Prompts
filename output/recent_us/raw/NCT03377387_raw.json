    "inclusion_criteria": "* Diagnosis of MDS by World Health Organization criteria, and either\n\n  1. International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) low risk or intermediate-1 risk patients without 5q deletion:\n\n     i. Dose escalation portion: failed prior treatment with at least 4 cycles started of a hypomethylating agent (HMA; azacitidine or decitabine) defined as no response to treatment, loss of response at any time point, or progressive disease/intolerance to therapy.\n\n     ii. Dose expansion portion: failed prior treatment defined as no response to treatment with at least 4 cycles started of HMA, loss of response at any time point, or progressive disease/intolerance to therapy (\"HMA failure\"); or no prior treatment with HMA (\"HMA naive\").\n  2. IPSS low risk or intermediate-1 risk patients with 5q deletion:\n\n     i. Dose escalation portion: failed prior treatment with at least 4 cycles started of lenalidomide and 4 cycles of hypomethylating agent (azacitidine or decitabine) defined as no response to treatment, loss of response at any time point, or progressive disease/intolerance to therapy.\n\n     ii. Dose expansion portion: same as non-del(5q) lower risk cohort + requirement of failed prior treatment with lenalidomide defined as no response to treatment with at least 4 cycles started of lenalidomide, loss of response at any time point, or progressive disease/intolerance to therapy.\n  3. IPSS intermediate-2 risk or high risk patients: HMA failure or HMA naïve as defined above.\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status ≤ 2\n* Screening laboratory values:\n\n  1. Renal glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ≥ 30 ml/min;\n  2. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) / Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 3.0 times upper limit of normal;\n  3.

    "exclusion_criteria": "* Use of chemotherapeutic agents or experimental agents for MDS within 14 days of the first day of study drug treatment.\n* Use of erythroid stimulating agents, Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), or Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) within 14 days of the first day of study drug treatment, or during the study.\n* Mean triplicate heart rate-corrected QT interval (QTc) > 500 msec.\n* Any of the following cardiac abnormalities:\n\n  1. QT interval > 480 msec corrected using Fridericia's formula;\n  2. Risk factors for Torsade de Pointes;\n  3. Use of medication that prolongs the QT interval with the exception of drugs that are considered absolutely essential for the care of the subject;\n  4. Myocardial infarction ≤ 6 months prior to first day of study drug treatment;\n  5. Unstable angina pectoris or serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia.\n* Any serious or uncontrolled medical disorder.\n* Prior malignancy within the previous 2 years except for local cancers that have been cured; or patients who have been adequately treated and have low risk of reoccurrence.\n* Subjects with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (> 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study drug administration. Inhaled or topical steroids, and adrenal replacement doses > 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease.\n* Use of other investigational drugs within 30 days of study drug administration.\n* Major surgery within 4 weeks of study drug administration.\n* Live-virus vaccination within 30 days of study drug administration.\n* Allergy to study drug component.",
