    "official_title": "Feasibility Study of Temporally Feathered Radiation Therapy (TFRT) for Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma: Means of Toxicity Reduction",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Subjects must have histologically or cytologically confirmed squamous cell carcinoma arising from a primary head and neck site (oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx/hypopharynx, nasopharynx).TX-4, NX-3, MX-0 stages are permitted.\n* Subjects must be eligible for definitive radiation therapy (70Gy in 35 fractions) with or without chemotherapy.\n* Karnofsky Performance status â‰¥80.\n* Subjects must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Subjects receiving any other investigational agents.\n* Postoperative radiotherapy is not permitted.\n* History of prior head and neck radiation therapy.\n* Subjects with uncontrolled inter-current illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* Pregnant or breastfeeding women are excluded from this study because radiation therapy has the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown, but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with radiation therapy, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with radiation therapy. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.\n* The patient cannot have distant metastatic disease (or M1 disease by AJCC 8th edition).",
