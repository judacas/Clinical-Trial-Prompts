Prior liver-directed (including ablative) treatment must be completed at least 28 days prior to registration\n* REGISTRATION: Prior treatment with 90-Yttrium radioembolization must be completed at least 6-weeks prior to registration\n* REGISTRATION: Radiation therapy to the lung and/or mediastinum must be completed at least 14 days prior to registration for stereotactic ablative and at least 28 days prior to registration for conventional fractionation\n* REGISTRATION: Prior treatment with systemic anticancer therapy must be completed at least 28 days prior to registration (except for somatostatin analogs in patients with functional tumors). Continuation of treatment with somatostatin analogs while on protocol therapy is allowed provided that the patient:\n\n  * Has functional tumors (evidence of peptide hormones and/or bioactive substances associated with a clinical hormone syndrome such as carcinoid syndrome or Cushing's syndrome), and\n  * Has previously demonstrated radiographic disease progression while on somatostatin analog therapy\n* REGISTRATION: Patients must have completed any major surgery at least 28 days prior to registration. Complete wound healing from major surgery should occur prior to registration\n* REGISTRATION: Patients should have improvement of any toxic effects of prior therapy (except alopecia, fatigue, and other non-reversible toxic effects such as neuropathy from cisplatin) to National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 5.0, grade 1 or less\n* REGISTRATION: Not pregnant and not nursing\n\n  * Therefore, for women of childbearing potential only, a negative pregnancy test done =< 28 days prior to registration is required\n* REGISTRATION: Age >= 18 years\n* REGISTRATION: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2\n* REGISTRATION: Hemoglobin >= 8.0 g/dL\n* REGISTRATION: Platelet count >= 75,000/mm^3\n* REGISTRATION: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >= 1,500/mm^3\n* REGISTRATION: Creatinine =< 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) OR calculated creatinine clearance >= 40 mL/min\n\n  * Calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault equation\n* REGISTRATION: Total bilirubin =< 2.0 x ULN\n\n  * In patients with Gilbert's syndrome, if total bilirubin is > 2.0 x ULN, then direct bilirubin must be =< 2.0 x ULN\n* REGISTRATION: Albumin >= 2.8 g/dL\n* REGISTRATION: Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) =< 3.0 x ULN\n* REGISTRATION: No known central nervous system metastases unless treated and clinically stable for at least 14 days prior to registration.

The exception is for patients with known active hepatitis B virus (defined as HbsAg reactive) infection, where the HBV viral load must be undetectable on suppressive therapy for patient to be eligible\n* REGISTRATION: Patients with known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections on effective anti-retroviral therapy with undetectable viral load within 6 months of registration are eligible for this trial\n* REGISTRATION: No known active or uncontrolled infections requiring ongoing antifungals or antibiotics in the 3 days prior to registration\n* REGISTRATION: No receipt of live attenuated vaccines in the 7 days prior to registration\n* REGISTRATION: No known decompensated liver cirrhosis\n* REGISTRATION: No known prior drug-induced pneumonitis that was symptomatic or required treatment\n* REGISTRATION: No known medical condition causing an inability to swallow and no known impairment of gastrointestinal function that may significantly alter the absorption of an oral agent\n* REGISTRATION: No known hypersensitivity to everolimus or other rapamycin analogs (e.g. sirolimus, temsirolimus, etc.)\n* REGISTRATION: Concurrent somatostatin analog use while on protocol therapy is allowed provided that the patient: 1) has a functional tumor (evidence of peptide hormones and/or bioactive substances associated with a clinical hormone syndrome such as carcinoid syndrome or Cushing's syndrome), 2) has previously demonstrated radiographic disease progression while on somatostatin analog therapy\n* REGISTRATION: Chronic concomitant treatment with P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and/or inducers is not allowed on the everolimus treatment arm of this study. Given that the study is randomized, all patients on P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and/or inducers must discontinue the drug(s) 7 days prior to registration\n* RE-REGISTRATION: Confirmation of disease progression by RECIST v1.1 by real-time Alliance ICL at IROC Ohio central radiographic review\n* RE-REGISTRATION: Not pregnant and not nursing\n\n  * Women of childbearing potential only, a negative pregnancy test done =< 28 days prior to re-registration is required\n* RE-REGISTRATION: ECOG performance status 0-2\n* RE-REGISTRATION: Hemoglobin >= 8.0 g/dL\n* RE-REGISTRATION: Platelet count >= 75,000/mm^3\n* RE-REGISTRATION: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >= 1,500/mm^3\n* RE-REGISTRATION: Creatinine =< 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) OR calculated creatinine clearance >= 40 mL/min\n\n  * Calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault equation\n* RE-REGISTRATION: Total bilirubin =< 2.0 x ULN\n\n  * In patients with Gilbert's syndrome, if total bilirubin is > 2.0 x ULN, then direct bilirubin must be =< 2.0 x ULN\n* RE-REGISTRATION: Albumin >= 2.8 g/dL\n* RE-REGISTRATION: AST/ALT =< 3.0 x ULN\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
