    "official_title": "A Randomized, Open-label, Phase 3 Study Comparing Once-weekly vs Twice-weekly Carfilzomib in Combination With Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone in Subjects With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma (A.R.R.O.W.2)",
    "inclusion_criteria": "Multiple myeloma with documented relapse or progression after most recent myeloma treatment. Subjects refractory to the most recent line of therapy are eligible, unless last treatment contained proteasome inhibitor (PI) or lenalidomide and dexamethasone. Refractory is defined as disease that is nonresponsive or progresses within 60 days of last therapy.\n\nSubjects must have at least PR to at least 1 line of prior therapy.\n\nSubjects must have received at least 1 but not more than 3 prior lines of therapy for multiple myeloma (induction therapy followed by stem cell transplant and consolidation maintenance therapy will be considered as 1 line of therapy).\n\nPrior therapy with a PI or the combination of lenalidomide and dexamethasone are allowed if the patient had at least a PR to the most recent treatment with a PI or lenalidomide and dexamethasone, neither PI or lenalidomide and dexamethasone containing treatment were ceased due to toxicity, the patient has not relapsed within 60 days of discontinuation of the PI or lenalidomide and dexamethasone containing treatment. A history of prior neuropathy is permitted if this was not grade 3, grade 4 or grade 2 with pain and if not resolved within the 14 days before enrollment, is less than or equal to grade 2 without pain. Patients are permitted to have received single agent lenalidomide as maintenance therapy within 60 days of enrollment.\n\nPrevious treatment with a lenalidomide and dexamethasone containing regimen is allowed, as long as the subject did not progress during the first 3 months after initiating lenalidomide and dexamethasone containing therapy.\n\nMeasurable disease with at least 1 of the following assessed within 21 days prior to randomization:\n\n* Immunoglobulin G (IgG) multiple myeloma: serum monoclonal protein (M-protein) level ≥ 1.0 g/dL\n* Immunoglobulin A (IgA), Immunoglobulin D (IgD), Immunoglobulin E (IgE) multiple myeloma: serum M-protein level ≥ 0.5 g/dL\n* Urine M-protein ≥ 200 mg per 24 hours\n* In subjects without measurable serum or urine M-protein, serum-free light chain (SFLC) ≥ 100 mg/L (involved light chain) and an abnormal serum kappa lambda ratio\n\nEastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) of 0 ≤ 2\n\nOther inclusion criteria may apply\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 99 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "Waldenström macroglobulinemia.\n\nMultiple myeloma of Immunoglobulin M (IgM) subtype.\n\nPlasma cell leukemia (> 2.0 × 10^9 /L circulating plasma cells by standard differential).\n\nUncontrolled hypertension, defined as a subject whose blood pressure is greater than or equal to 160 mmHg systolic or greater than or equal to 100 mmHg diastolic when taken in accordance with the European Society of Hypertension/European Society of Cardiology 2018 guidelines (Section 12.10; Williams et al, 2018).\n\nActive congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association Class III to IV), symptomatic ischemia, uncontrolled arrhythmias, screening ECG with corrected QT interval (QTc) of > 470 msec, pericardial disease, or myocardial infarction within 4 months prior to randomization.\n\nCalculated or measured creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min (calculation must be based on the Cockcroft and Gault formula) within 28 days prior to randomization.\n\nOther exclusion criteria may apply",
