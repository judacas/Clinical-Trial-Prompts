    "official_title": "Pilot Study: Infusion of Off-the-Shelf Ex Vivo Expanded Cryopreserved Progenitor Cells (Dilanubicel) in the Setting of Single Cord Blood Transplantation for Patients With Hematologic Malignancies",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Patients 10 to 65 years old with a hematologic malignancy in need of hematopoietic cell transplant who are > 30 kg and without a suitable related donor\n* Patient must have hematologic malignancy that meets institutional eligibility requirements for cord blood transplant\n* Malignancies included are:\n\n  * Acute leukemia, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), biphenotypic acute leukemia or mixed-lineage leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL); all patients must be in complete response (CR) as defined by < 5% blasts by morphology/flow cytometry in a representative bone marrow sample with adequate cellularity to assess remission status\n  * Myelodysplasia (MDS) International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) intermediate (Int)-2 or high risk (i.e., refractory anemia with excess blasts [RAEB], refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation [RAEBt]) or refractory anemia with severe pancytopenia or high risk cytogenetics; blasts must be < 10% in a representative bone marrow aspirate\n  * Chronic myeloid leukemia excluding refractory blast crisis; to be eligible in first chronic phase (CP1) patient must have failed or be intolerant to tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy\n* High dose TBI regimen: 10 to =< 45 years\n* Intermediate intensity regimen: 10 to =< 65 years\n* Patients 10 to =< 45 years: Lansky (< 16 years old) or Karnofsky (>= 16 years old) >= 70 or Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 0-1\n* Patients > 45 to =< 65 years: Karnofsky >= 70 or ECOG 0-1 and non-age adjusted comorbidity index =< 5\n* Adults: Calculated creatinine clearance must be > 60 mL and serum creatinine =< 2 mg/dL\n* Children (< 18 years old): Calculated creatinine clearance must be > 60 mL/min\n* Total serum bilirubin must be < 3 mg/dL unless the elevation is thought to be due to Gilbert's disease or hemolysis\n* Transaminases must be < 3 x the upper limit of normal per reference values of treating institution\n* Carbon monoxide diffusing capability (DLCO) corrected >= 60% normal (may not be on supplemental oxygen)\n* For pediatric patients unable to perform pulmonary function tests, O2 saturation > 92% on room air\n* Left ventricular ejection fraction >= 50% OR\n* Shortening fraction > 26%\n* Ability of participant or legally authorized representative to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent form\n* DONOR: Minimum requirement: The cord blood (CB) unit must be matched at a minimum at 4/6 HLA-A, B antigens and DRB1 allele with the recipient; therefore, 0-2 mismatches at the A or B or DRB1 loci based on intermediate resolution at HLA-A, B and high resolution allele level typing at HLA- DRB1 are allowed\n* DONOR: Institutional guidelines for HLA-match may be followed as long as the minimum criteria for HLA-matching as above are met\n* DONOR: The CB unit selected for transplant must have a MINIMUM of 2.5 x 10^7 TNC/kg\n* DONOR: The minimum recommended CD34/kg cell dose is 1.7 x 10^5 CD34/kg\n* DONOR: A backup unit must be identified and reserved prior to the start of the treatment plan for possible infusion in the unlikely event of poor post-thaw viability of the primary CB unit. A suitable back up unit will be considered, as follows:\n\n  * Must be matched at a minimum at 4/6 HLA-A, B, DRBl loci with the recipient. Therefore 0-2 mismatches at the A or B or DRBl loci based on intermediate resolution A, B antigen and DRBl allele typing for determination of HLA-match is allowed (Fred Hutch Protocol 2010).\n  * Must contain a MINIMUM of 1.5 x 10^7 TNC/kg to ensure the same requirement we use for a standard double CBT per CB selection guideline (Fred Hutch Protocol 2010).\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 10 Years\nMust have maximum age of 65 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Uncontrolled viral or bacterial infection at the time of study enrollment\n* Active or recent (prior 6 month) invasive fungal infection unless cleared by infectious disease (ID) consult\n* History of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection\n* Pregnant or breastfeeding\n* Prior allogeneic transplant\n* Central nervous system (CNS) leukemic involvement not clearing with intrathecal chemotherapy; diagnostic lumbar puncture is to be performed\n* < 30 kg",
