    "inclusion_criteria": "* Pathologically (histologically or cytologically) or radiographically-proven (based on the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [AALSD] criteria) unresectable or locally recurrent hepatocellular cancer prior to registration\n* Appropriate stage for study entry based on the following diagnostic workup:\n\n  * All patients must have computed tomography (CT) scan chest/abdomen/pelvis with multiphasic liver CT scan prior to registration; if CT contrast is contraindicated, CT chest without contrast and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of abdomen is permitted\n  * Participants must have measurable disease at study entry, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as > 2 cm with conventional techniques or as > 1 cm with spiral CT scan\n  * Patient must have 3 or fewer single or multinodular tumors; for patients with a single lesion, lesion must be 15 cm or less in greatest dimension; for patients with two lesions, no lesion may be greater than 10 cm in greatest dimension; for patients with three lesions, no lesion may be greater than 6 cm in greatest dimension; portal vein involvement or thrombosis combined with a single lesion that is >= 1 cm and =< 15 cm in greatest dimension is allowed\n* Age >= 18\n* Zubrod performance status 0-1 within 30 days prior to registration\n* Negative urine or serum pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential within 7 days prior to study entry\n* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >= 1,000 cells/mm^3\n* Platelets >= 50,000 cells/mm^3\n* Hemoglobin >= 9.0 g/dl; (Note: The use of transfusion or other intervention to achieve hemoglobin [Hgb] >= 9.0 g/dl is acceptable)\n* Total bilirubin < 4 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)\n* Transaminases (aspartate aminotransferase [AST] and alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) < 6 x institutional ULN\n* Albumin >= 2.5 g/dl\n* Creatinine < 2 mg/dl\n* Prior chemotherapy, targeted biological therapy (e.g. sorafenib), surgery, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), ablation for present disease is acceptable\n* Must have Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) A or B7\n* The patient or a legally authorized representative must provide study-specific informed consent prior to study registration\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* PRIOR TO STEP ONE REGISTRATION:\n* Definitive clinical or radiologic documentation of extrahepatic tumor, defined as extrahepatic metastases or malignant nodes (that enhance with typical features of HCC) > 3.0 cm, in sum of maximal diameters (e.g. presence of one 3.4 cm metastatic lymph node or two 2 cm lung lesions); note that benign non-enhancing periportal lymphadenopathy is not unusual in the presence of hepatitis and is permitted, even if the sum of enlarged nodes is > 2.0 cm\n* Uncontrolled prior invasive malignancy, excluding the current diagnosis\n* Systemic chemotherapy for the study cancer < 2 weeks prior to registration\n* Pregnancy or women of childbearing potential and men who are sexually active and not willing/able to use medically acceptable forms of contraception; this exclusion is necessary because the treatment involved in this study may be significantly teratogenic\n* HIV positive with CD4 count < 200 cells/microliter; note that patients who are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive are eligible, provided they are under treatment with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and have a CD4 count >= 200 cells/microliter prior to registration; note also that HIV testing is not required for eligibility for this protocol; this exclusion criterion is necessary because the treatments involved in this protocol may be significantly immunosuppressive\n* Prior radiotherapy to the region of the study cancer that would result in overlap of radiation therapy fields (to include Y90)\n* Prior liver transplant\n* PRIOR TO STEP TWO RANDOMIZATION:\n* Unable to obtain confirmation of payment coverage (insurance or other) for either possible treatment",
