    "exclusion_criteria": "* Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL)\n* Core Binding Factor (CBF)-AML Note: participants with r/r CBF-AML after at least 2 salvage attempts can be enrolled into the study\n* Group II only: participants with normal karyotype and a favorable molecular profile according to ELN guideline 2017\n* Participants with active bacterial, fungal or viral infection considered by the Investigator to be clinically uncontrolled or of unacceptable risk upon the induction of neutropenia (i.e. participants who are or should be on antimicrobial agents for the treatment of active infection)\n* Grade >= 2 glomerular proteinuria at screening or on Cycle 1 Day 1 prior to the first dosing.\n* Another primary malignancy (other than AML) that requires active therapy. Adjuvant hormonal therapy is allowed\n* Clinical evidence or history of central nervous system (CNS) leukemia\n* Presence of extramedullary disease at screening\n* Current or past history of CNS disease, such as stroke, CNS inflammation, epilepsy, CNS vasculitis, or neurodegenerative disease\n* Participants who have a history of clinically significant liver disease, including liver cirrhosis (e.g. Child-Pugh class B and C) or participants who have a history of active or chronic infectious hepatitis unless serology demonstrates clearance of infection\n* Participants who might refuse to receive blood products and/or have known hypersensitivity to any of the components of RO7283420, tocilizumab, or dasatinib",
