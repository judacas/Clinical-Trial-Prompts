    "inclusion_criteria": "* Life expectancy ≥ 10 years.\n* Serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ≤ 15ng/mL.\n* A histologically proven, clinically significant lesion visible on mpMRI (magnetic resonance imaging) that is accessible to PRX302 transperineal injection.\n* Radiological stage T1-T2 N0 Mx/M0 disease.\n* Targeted prostate biopsy within 6 months prior to dosing, with a clinically significant lesion correlating with an mpMRI visible lesion.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be MALE\nMust have minimum age of 40 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Previous radiation therapy to the pelvis.\n* Androgen suppression or anti-androgen therapy within the 12 months prior to dosing, for prostate cancer.\n* Use of 5-alpha reductase inhibitor within the 3 months prior to dosing.\n* Evidence of metastatic disease or nodal disease outside the prostate on bone scan or cross-sectional imaging.\n* Inability to tolerate transrectal ultrasound (TRUS).\n* Known allergy to latex or gadolinium (Gd).\n* Prior rectal surgery preventing insertion of the TRUS probe.\n* Any previous ablative procedures performed on the prostate, e.g., electroporation, radiofrequency ablation, high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), cryosurgery, photochemical, thermal or microwave therapy to treat cancer of the prostate.\n* Unable to have pelvic MRI scanning (severe claustrophobia, permanent cardiac pacemaker, metallic implant, etc., likely to contribute significant artifact to images).",
