Patient or partner(s) meets one of the following criteria:\n\n   1. Non-childbearing potential (i.e.) not sexually active, physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant, including people who are post-menopausal or surgically sterile.

Platelet count ≥ 100,000/µl unsupported is necessary for eligibility on the study; however, because of risks of intracranial hemorrhage with catheter placement, platelet count ≥ 125,000/µl is required for the patient to undergo biopsy and catheter insertion, which can be attained with the help of platelet transfusion\n7. Neutrophil count ≥ 1000 prior to biopsy\n8. Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x normal range prior to biopsy\n9.

Patients with prior history of thrombosis/embolism are allowed to be on anticoagulation, understanding that anticoagulation will be held in the perioperative period per the neurosurgical team's recommendations. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is preferred. If a patient is on warfarin, the international normalized ratio (INR) is to be obtained and value should be below 2.0 prior to biopsy.\n12. At the time of biopsy, prior to administration of D2C7-IT, the presence of recurrent tumor must be confirmed by histopathological analysis\n13.
