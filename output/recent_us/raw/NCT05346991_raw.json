Fallopian tube implants (if confirmed by hysterosalpingogram) 13. Oocyte donation is prohibited during the duration of participation on this protocol and for 1 month after the last dose of Pirtobrutinib.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Participants with central nervous system involvement with mantle cell lymphoma or with suspected or confirmed progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) are excluded since those participants have very poor prognosis, need aggressive intensive chemoimmunotherapy and intrathecal chemotherapy along with BTK inhibitors and these participants would not be eligible for this study.\n2. High risk MCL - any or all of the following (Blastoid/pleomorphic histology), High Ki-67 (>50%), Bulky disease (nodes >5 cm, spleen >20 cm), lymphocytosis >=50,000 cells/uL, TP53 mutated or del17p by FISH.

History of bleeding diathesis\n5. Known active CMV. Unknown or negative status are eligible\n6. Evidence of other clinically significant uncontrolled condition(s) including but not limited to, uncontrolled systemic bacterial, viral, fungal or parasitic infection (except for fungal nail infection), or other clinically significant active disease process which in the opinion of the investigator and medical monitor may pose a risk for participant participation. Screening for chronic conditions is not required\n7. Clinically significant cardiovascular diseases as determined after cardiology consultation, including uncontrolled or symptomatic arrhythmias, congestive heart failure or myocardial infarction within 6 months of screening or any Class 3 (moderate) or 4 (severe) cardiac disease following the New York Heart Association Classification.

Current treatment with certain strong cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors or inducers and/or strong P-gp inhibitors. Because of their effect on CYP3A4, use of any of the following within 3 days of study therapy start or planned use during study participation is prohibited - grapefruit or grapefruit products, Seville oranges or products from Seville oranges, star fruit\n12. Participants taking warfarin and/or equivalent vitamin K antagonists\n13.

NOTE: Major bleeding is defined as bleeding having one or more of the following features: potentially life-threatening bleeding with signs or symptoms of hemodynamic compromise; bleeding associated with a decrease in the hemoglobin level of at least 2g per deciliter; or bleeding in a critical area or organ (e.g., retroperitoneal, intraarticular, pericardial, epidural, or intracranial bleeding or intramuscular bleeding with compartment syndrome).\n18. Participants who have tested positive for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) are excluded due to risk of opportunistic infections with both HIV and BTK-inhibitors. For patients with unknown HIV status, HIV testing will be performed at Screening and result must be negative for enrollment\n19. Known active hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection based on criteria below: Hepatitis B virus (HBV): Participants with positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) are excluded. Patients with positive hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) and negative HBsAg require hepatitis B polymerase chain reaction (PCR) evaluation before enrollment. Participants who are hepatitis B PCR positive will be excluded unless cleared by infectious disease. If a participant is Hep B core antibody positive, they must be on an approved nucleos(T)ide analogue to help prevent reactivation. Hepatitis C virus (HCV): positive hepatitis C antibody. If positive hepatitis C antibody result, participant will need to have a negative result for hepatitis C ribonucleic acid (RNA) before enrollment, unless cleared by infectious disease. Participants who are hepatitis C RNA positive will be excluded.\n20. Evidence of other clinically significant uncontrolled condition(s) including but not limited to, uncontrolled systemic bacterial, viral including CMV, fungal or parasitic infection (except for fungal nail infection), or other clinically significant active disease process which in the opinion of the investigator and IND sponsor may pose a risk for patient participation. Screening for chronic conditions is not required.\n21. Prolongation of the QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTcF) > 470 msec on one electrocardiograms (ECGs), during Screening. EKG might be repeated same day to check for any physiologic variation. QTcF is calculated using Fridericia's Formula (QTcF): QTcF = QT/(RR0.33).\n22. Correction of suspected drug induced QTcF prolongation can be attempted at the investigator's discretion and only if clinically safe to do so with either discontinuation of the offending drug or switch to another drug not known to be associated with QTcF prolongation.\n23. Correction for underlying bundle branch block (BBB) allowed. Note: Participants with pacemakers are eligible if they have no history of fainting or clinically relevant arrhythmias while using the pacemaker.\n24. Concomitant malignancies or previous malignancies with less than a 1-year disease-free interval at the time of signing consent. Subjects with adequately treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or adequately treated carcinoma in situ (e.g. cervix) may enroll irrespective of the time of diagnosis. Patients with controlled, advanced prostate cancer (not on active chemotherapy) are permitted. Active second malignancy unless in remission with life expectancy > 1 years. Examples include:\n\n    1. Adequately treated no melanomatous skin cancer or lentigo maligna melanoma without current evidence of disease.\n    2. Adequately treated cervical carcinoma in situ without current evidence of disease.\n    3.

Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that, in the opinion of the investigator, may increase the risk associated with study participation or study treatment administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and/or would make the participant inappropriate for enrollment into this study.\n28. No concomitant anticancer therapies, immunotherapies, cellular, or radiotherapy. No major surgery within 4 weeks prior to first dose of study treatment.\n29. Uncontrolled autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) or immune thrombocytopenia. Active uncontrolled auto-immune cytopenia (e.g., autoimmune hemolytic anemia [AIHA], idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura [ITP]) is for which new therapy was introduced or existing therapy was escalated within the 4 weeks prior to study enrollment to maintain adequate blood counts.\n30. Concomitant steroids for disease related pain control are allowed at any dose but must be discontinued prior to any study treatment initiation. Chronic use of corticosteroids is allowed up to 20 mg prednisone or equivalent daily for non-cancer related conditions at the time of study start.\n31. History of GVHD, allogeneic HSCT transplant, allogeneic organ transplant\n32. Any serious medical condition including but not limited to, uncontrolled hypertension, diabetes mellitus, active/symptomatic coronary artery disease, COPD, renal failure, active infection, active hemorrhage, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric illness that places the participant at unacceptable risk and would prevent the subject from signing the informed consent form.",
