Viral testing is not required for assessment of eligibility for the study.\n* Known serious active infection including, but not limited to, tuberculosis, or human immunodeficiency virus (positive human immunodeficiency virus 1/2 antibodies).\n* Presence of other active cancers, or history of treatment for invasive cancer, within the last 5 years. Patients with Stage I cancer who have received definitive local treatment at least 3 years previously, and are considered unlikely to recur are eligible. All patients with previously treated in situ carcinoma (ie, non-invasive) are eligible, as are patients with history of non-melanoma skin cancer.\n* Spinal cord compression or brain metastases unless asymptomatic, stable and not requiring steroids for at least 2 weeks prior to start of study treatment.\n* Past medical history of interstitial lung disease(ILD), drug-induced ILD, radiation pneumonitis which required steroid treatment, or any evidence of clinically active ILD.\n* History of liver cirrhosis of any origin and clinical stage; or history of other serious liver disease or chronic disease with relevant liver involvement, with or without normal LFTs,\n* Prior or current treatment with a 3rd generation EGFR-TKI other than osimertinib\n* Prior or current treatment with savolitinib or another MET inhibitor (eg, foretinib, crizotinib, cabozantinib, onartuzumab, capmatinib).\n* Any cytotoxic chemotherapy, investigational agents or other anticancer drugs for the treatment of advanced NSCLC from a previous treatment regimen or clinical study within 14 days prior to the first dose of study treatment with the exception of monotherapy osimertinib which may continue uninterrupted during screening.\n* Patients currently receiving (or unable to stop use prior to receiving the first dose of study treatment) medications or herbal supplements known to be strong inducers of CYP3A4, strong inhibitors of CYP1A2 within 3 weeks of the first dose of study treatment (including St John's Wort).\n* Participation in another clinical study with a cytotoxic, investigational product (IP), or other anticancer drug for the treatment of advanced NSCLC if received IP from that study within 14 days of the first dose of study treatment.\n* Known hypersensitivity to the active or inactive excipients of osimertinib or savolitinib or drugs with a similar chemical structure or class.",
    "miscellaneous_criteria": "Inclusion criteria:\n\n* Patients must be ≥18 years of age (≥20 years of age in Japan). All genders are permitted.\n* Histologically or cytologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic EGFRm+ NSCLC harbouring an EGFR mutation known to be associated with EGFR TKI sensitivity and permitted in the osimertinib national label (such as either exon 19 deletion and/or L858R) which is not amenable to curative therapy.\n* Documented radiologic disease progression on 1L osimertinib.\n* MET amplification and/or overexpression (FISH10+ and/or IHC90+) as determined by FISH (central) and IHC (central) testing on tumour sample collected following progression on 1L osimertinib treatment.\n* Available tumour sample for central MET FISH and IHC analysis or willingness to collect additional sample for central testing which fulfils the following requirements:\n\nObtained following progression on previous osimertinib therapy;\n\nobtained within 2 years of submission for MET analysis;\n\nsufficient tissue to meet the minimum tissue requirement defined in the current Laboratory Manual.\n\n* At least 1 lesion, not previously irradiated, not biopsied during the screening period, that can be accurately measured at baseline as ≥10 mm in the longest diameter (except lymph nodes which must have short axis ≥15 mm) with CT or MRI which is suitable for accurate repeated measurements. If only 1 measurable lesion exists, it is acceptable to be used as long as baseline tumour assessment scans are done at least 14 days after the screening tumour sample collection is performed.\n* Prior lines of therapy in locally advanced/metastatic setting: Only prior 1L osimertinib treatment in metastatic setting is permitted.\n* Adequate haematological function defined as:\n* Absolute neutrophil count ≥1500/μL\n* Haemoglobin ≥9 g/dL (no transfusion in the past 2 weeks)\n* Platelets ≥100,000/μL (no transfusion in the past 10 days)\n* Adequate liver function\n* ALT, AST ≤2.5 x ULN with TBL ≤ ULN OR\n* TBL >ULN to ≤1.5x ULN with ALT and AST ≤ ULN\n* Adequate renal function - defined as a serum creatinine <1.5 times the institutional ULN OR a glomerular filtration rate ≥50 mL/min. Confirmation of creatinine clearance is only required when creatinine is only required when creatinine is >1.5 times ULN.\n* Adequate coagulation parameters: INR <1.5 and activated partial thromboplastin time <1.5 x ULN unless patients are receiving therapeutic anti coagulation which affects these parameters.\n* Patients with known tumour thrombus or deep vein thrombosis are eligible if clinically stable on low molecular weight heparin for ≥2 weeks. The use of direct oral anticoagulants such as apixaban/rivaroxaban will be accepted as treatment for cancer related thromboembolism treatment. The use of warfarin for oral anticoagulation is not recommended.\n* ECOG/WHO performance status of 0 or 1 with no deterioration over the previous 2 weeks and a minimum life expectancy of 12 weeks.\n* Females must be using highly effective contraceptive measures, should not be breast feeding and must have a negative pregnancy test if of childbearing potential, or must have evidence of non-childbearing potential.\n* Males with a female partner of childbearing potential should be willing to use barrier contraception during the study and for 6 months following discontinuation of study drug."
