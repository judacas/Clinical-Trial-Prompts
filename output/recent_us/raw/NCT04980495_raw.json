    "exclusion_criteria": "* Symptomatic Multiple Myeloma or any evidence of CRAB criteria, including presence of myeloma defining events (MDE). Any prior therapy for active Myeloma should also be excluded. Prior therapy for smoldering myeloma is not an exclusion criterion. Bisphosphonates are not excluded\n* Other concurrent chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, or any ancillary therapy considered investigational. Prior therapy with bisphosphonate is allowed. Prior radiation therapy to a solitary plasmacytoma is allowed. Prior clinical trials or therapy for smoldering MM or MGUS are allowed but should be discussed with the Principal Investigator.\n* Serious medical or psychiatric illness likely to interfere with participation in this clinical study.\n* Diagnosed or treated for another malignancy within 2 years of enrollment, with the exception of complete resection of basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, an in-situ malignancy, or low-risk prostate cancer after curative therapy.\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* Pregnant or nursing women will be excluded from the study because lenalidomide is an agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to daratumumab, bortezomib, lenalidomide, or hyaluronidase\n* Known seropositive for or active viral infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) or SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19).\n\n  * Patients who are seropositive because of hepatitis B virus vaccine are eligible.\n  * Patients who are positive for SARS-COV-2 antibody, HIV1 and 2 antibody, hepatitis B core antibody or hepatitis B surface antigen must have a negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result before enrollment. Those who are PCR positive will be excluded.\n* Subject has known chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or severe, persistent asthma with a Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) < 50% of predicted normal.\n\n  * Note that PFT/FEV1 testing is required at screening for patients suspected of having COPD or severe, persistent asthma or are suspected of having those conditions or other respiratory impairment",
