    "official_title": "INRT- AIR: A Prospective Phase II Study of Involved Nodal Radiation Therapy Using Artificial Intelligence-Based Radiomics for Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma",
    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Pathologically-proven diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx, larynx, or hypopharynx. Squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary is not allowed.\n2. Patients must have clinically or radiographically evident measureable disease at the primary site and/or nodal stations. Diagnostic lymph node excision (< 2 nodes) is also allowable.\n3. Patients may undergo a diagnostic or therapeutic transoral resection for a T1-2 tonsil or base of tongue cancer.\n4. Clinical stage I-IVB (AJCC, 7th edition); stages I-II glottic cancer are excluded\n5. Age â‰¥ 18 years.\n6. ECOG Performance Status 0-2\n7. Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for 90 days following completion of therapy. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.\n\n   7.1 A female of child-bearing potential is any woman (regardless of sexual orientation, having undergone a tubal ligation, or remaining celibate by choice) who meets the following criteria:\n   * Has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or\n   * Has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months).\n8. Negative serum pregnancy test within 2 weeks before registration for women of childbearing potential.\n9. Neck CT and/or neck MRI, and PET-CT (at least skull-to-thigh).\n10. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Distant metastasis.\n2. Inability to undergo PET-CT.\n3. Stage I and II glottic carcinoma.\n4. Gross total excision of both the primary and nodal disease.\n5. Synchronous non-skin cancer primaries outside of the oropharynx, larynx, and hypopharynx except for low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer and synchronous well-differentiated thyroid cancer; in the latter case, surgery may occur before or after treatment, provided all other eligibility criteria are met .\n6. Prior invasive malignancy with an expected disease-free interval of less than 3 years.\n7. Prior systemic chemotherapy for the study cancer; prior chemotherapy for a remote cancer is allowable\n8. Prior radiotherapy to the region of the study cancer that would result in overlap of radiation fields.\n9. Subjects may not be receiving any other investigational agents.\n10. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to the chemotherapy agents in this study (if necessary).\n11. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that, in the opinion of the investigator, would limit compliance with study requirements\n12. Subjects must not be pregnant or nursing due to the potential for congenital abnormalities and the potential of this regimen to harm nursing infants.\n13. History of severe immunosuppression, including HIV, and organ or autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplant.",
