    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Pathologically confirmed NSCLC\n2. Age > 18\n3. ECOG Performance Status 0-1.\n4. Pulmonary function capacity capable of tolerating the proposed lung resection. FEV1 at least 2 L. If less than 2 L, the predicted postoperative forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) must be > 0.8 L or be > 35% of the predicted value. Postoperative predicted DLCO ≥ 35% is required.\n5. Resectable stage IB-IIIB (T2-3N0, T1-T3N1-2) NSCLC (per the 8th Edition American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) classification) who are candidates for surgery with intent of R0 resection. Invasive T3 disease (eg, phrenic nerve, pericardium, chest wall other than Pancoast superior sulcus) may be included if the surgeon and study team deem it to be resectable.\n6. N2 nodes must be discrete (ie, not invading surrounding structures). If patients have N2 disease, as suspected by CT or PET, histologic proof of N2 status is recommended.\n7. Patients must be evaluated by a Thoracic Surgeon prior to registration. Operability is defined as having adequate pulmonary, cardiac, renal, nutritional, musculoskeletal, neurologic, and cognitive capacity to undergo major pulmonary resection with acceptable morbidity and mortality. Absence of major associated comorbidities that increase the surgery risk to an unacceptable level.\n8. No prior history of thoracic radiation.\n9. Adequate Organ and marrow function as defined below\n\n   * leukocytes ≥2,000/mcL,\n   * absolute neutrophil count ≥1,000/mcL,\n   * platelets ≥100,000/mcL,\n   * Hemoglobin >8.0 g/dL\n   * Total bilirubin within normal institutional limits\n   * AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤2.5 × institutional upper limit of normal\n   * creatinine within normal institutional limits OR creatinine clearance ≥50 mL/min/1.73 m2 for participants with creatinine levels above institutional normal.\n10. Patients are capable of giving informed consent and/or have an acceptable surrogate capable of giving consent on the subject's behalf.\n11. Nonpregnant and non-nursing. The effect of ipilimumab and nivolumab on the fetus is unknown.\n12. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must be willing to use 2 methods of birth control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course of the study through 5 months after the last dose of study medication. Patients of childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not been free of menses >1 year.\n13. Evidence of postmenopausal status or negative urinary or serum pregnancy test for female premenopausal patients. Women will be considered postmenopausal if they have been amenorrheic for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. The following age-specific requirements apply:\n14. Women <50 years of age would be considered postmenopausal if they have been amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal treatments and if they have luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone levels in the postmenopausal range for the institution or underwent surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy).\n15. Women ≥50 years of age would be considered postmenopausal if they have been amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments, had radiation-induced menopause with last menses >1 year ago, had chemotherapy-induced menopause with last menses >1 year ago, or underwent surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, or hysterectomy).\n16. Patient is willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study including undergoing treatment and scheduled visits and examinations including follow up.\n17. Male patients must agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting with the first dose of study therapy through 7 months after the last dose of study therapy.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
