    "official_title": "Quantitative Assessment of Radiation-induced Neuroinflammation - A Proof of Principle Study",
    "inclusion_criteria": "Healthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 8 Years\nMust have maximum age of 39 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Participants with a large pseudomeningocele (>4 cm in size) at the surgical site, complications from ventricular access (evidenced by hemorrhage and/or enhancement along the catheter), large subdural effusion in the supra-tentorial compartment (>1 cm in the maximum transverse dimension). All of these are expected to induce inflammation.\n* Female participants of childbearing age must not be lactating due to theoretical potential harm to the infant from exposure to radiation.\n* Subjects with low-affinity TSPO binding sites as determined by the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs6971 in the TSPO gene.\n* Pregnant subjects.\n* Patients needing sedation for the PET scans or optional MRI scans.\n* Participants with a diagnosis of recurrent medulloblastoma.",
    "miscellaneous_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria\n\n* Participant is at least 8 years of age\n* Participants with histologically confirmed medulloblastoma and are scheduled to receive 36 Gy craniospinal irradiation\n* Participant and/or guardian can understand and is willing to sign a written informed consent document according to institutional guidelines\n* Subjects have either have high-affinity or mixed-affinity TSPO binding sites as determined by the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs6971 in the TSPO gene."
