    "official_title": "A Phase II Multi-Institutional Trial to Evaluate Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PMSA)-Based PET Imaging of High Risk Prostate Cancer",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* INCLUSION CRITERIA:\n* Patients must have histologically proven prostate adenocarcinoma confirmed by a CLIA certified laboratory.\n* Must have prostate cancer with high risk features defined as:\n\n  * Gleason 8 and higher OR\n  * PSA > 20 ng/mL OR\n  * Clinical stage T3a (i.e. likely extraprostatic extension on MRI) or T3b\n* Patients must be eligible for and must be planning to undergo radical prostatectomy and lymphadenectomy regardless of findings on 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT\n* Men age greater than or equal to 18 years.\n* ECOG performance status <2\n* Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:\n\n  * Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 9 g/dL\n  * leukocytes greater than or equal to 3,000/mcL\n  * platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/mcL\n  * total bilirubin <2 X normal institutional limits\n* AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) less than or equal to 3 X normal institutional limits\n* creatinine <2 X normal institutional limits\n\nOR\n\neGFR greater than or equal to 50 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal.\n\n* Ability of subject to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n* Willingness and ability to undergo biopsy of radiotracer-avid lesion if feasible.\n* Willingness and ability to undergo multiparametric prostate MRI and 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\n* Any investigational agents in the past 28 days prior to enrollment.\n* Clinical stage T4 (tumor invades adjacent structures except seminal vesicles).\n* Distant metastatic disease on conventional imaging studies (computed tomography (CT)) of the abdomen and pelvis and bone scan. NaF PET/CT scan cannot substitute for a bone scan. Given lack of specificity of CT for lymph node metastases at lower thresholds, pelvic lymph nodes below 2 cm in the short axis are allowed.\n* Any prior hormone therapy used to treat prostate cancer, except limited androgen receptor antagonist therapy, defined as less than or equal to 3 days of treatment. The medication must be discontinued within 5 half-lives of the compound prior to study entry.\n* Any prior therapy for prostate cancer with surgery, radiation, and/or chemotherapy.\n* Contraindication to MRI or PET:\n\n  * Patients weighing more than weight limit for the scanner tables or unable to fit within the imaging gantry\n  * Prior reaction to 18F-DCFPyL\n  * Patients with pacemakers, cerebral aneurysm clips, shrapnel injury or implantable electronic device that are not MRI compatible at 3 T\n  * Severe claustrophobia unresponsive to oral anxiolytics\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* Other medical conditions deemed by the principal investigator (or associates) to make the subject unsafe/ineligible for the protocol procedures or for radical prostatectomy.\n* A malignancy within the past 3 years for which prostatectomy is a contraindication.\n* Radiotracer administered within 5 half-lives prior to the date of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT imaging.\n* PSMA-targeted imaging within 6 months with 18F-DCFPyL tracer prior to the date of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT imaging. Participants can have PSMA targeted imaging with Gallium.\n* Unable to refrain from fathering a child or donating sperm for 10 days after each 18FDCFPyL injection.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be MALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
