    "inclusion_criteria": "* INCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\nParticipants must have histologically or cytologically confirmed any solid tumor (Cohort 1) or castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC, Cohorts 2A, 2D and 2R).\n\nFor the Cohort 1, eligible participants must have a histologically, cytologically or radiographically proven metastatic or locally advanced solid tumor of any type, for which there is no curative standard therapy or standard therapy has failed.\n\nCastrate testosterone level (less than 50ng/dl or 1.7nmol /L). (Participants with a malignancy other than prostate cancer are excluded from this criterion).\n\nRadiological confirmation of metastatic disease, or\n\nProgressive disease at study entry defined as one or more of the following criteria occurring in the setting of castrate levels of testosterone:\n\n--Radiographic progression defined as any new or enlarging bone lesions or growing lymph node disease, consistent with prostate cancer\n\nOR\n\n--PSA progression defined by sequence of rising values separated by greater than 1 week (2 separate increasing values over a minimum of 1 ng/ml (PCWG3 PSA eligibility criteria). If participants had been on flutamide, PSA progression is documented 4 weeks or more after withdrawal. For participants on bicalutamide or nilutamide disease progression is documented 6 or more weeks after withdrawal. The requirement for a 4-6 week withdrawal period following discontinuation of flutamide, nilutamide or bicalutamide only applies to participants who have been on these drugs for at least the prior 6 months. For all other participants they must stop bicalutamide, nilutamide or flutamide the day prior to enrollment.\n\nAsymptomatic or mildly symptomatic form prostate cancer; no use of regularly scheduled opiate analgesics for prostate cancer-related pain. (Participants with a malignancy other than prostate cancer are excluded from this criterion).\n\nParticipants must agree to continuation of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue/antagonist or bilateral orchiectomy. (Participants with a malignancy other than prostate cancer are excluded from this criterion). Participants may also continue oral androgen receptor antagonist/anti-androgen therapy (e.g. enzalutamide or abiraterone) unless enrolling to Arm 2.3A or 2.3B due to concerns regarding CYPmediated drug-drug interactions epacadostat.\n\nParticipants must have had the following prior therapy:\n\nTestosterone lowering therapy for CRPC\n\nIn addition to continuation of ADT (unless status post bilateral orchiectomy) eligible patients must have received and had PSA or radiographic progression on enzalutamide (or other oral androgen receptor antagonist e.g. darolutamide or apalutamdide) or abiraterone acetate.\n\nParticipants who have tumors known to be microsatellite instability high/mismatch repair deficient or tumor mutational burden high must have received prior pembrolizumab.\n\nParticipants with known pathogenic homologous recombination repair mutations for which there is evidence of benefit with PARP inhibitors (e.g. BRCA1. BRCA2, ATM) must have received prior PARP inhibitor.\n\nAge greater than or equal to 18 years.\n\nECOG performance status less than or equal to 1\n\nParticipants must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:\n\n* Absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1000/mcL\n* Platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/mcL\n* Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 9.0 g/dL\n* Total bilirubin within normal institutional limits; in participants with Gilbert s, less than or equal to 3.0 mg/dL\n* AST (AGOT)/ALT (AGPT) less than or equal to 2.5X upper limit of normal. For subjects with liver involvement in their tumor, AST less than or equal to 3.5. X ULN, ALT less than or equal to 3.5 X ULN, and bilirubin less than or equal to 3.0 is acceptable\n* Creatinine within 1.5X upper limit of normal institutional limits\n\nThe effects of BN-Brachyury, M7824, N-803, and Epacadostat on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, men and women must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, during the study and maintain such contraception until 4 months following the last dose of any study agent. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her partner s treating physician immediately.\n\nAbility of subject to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n\nParticipants with successfully treated HCV are eligible if HCV viral load is undetectable.\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\nParticipants who are immunocompromised as follows:\n\n* Human immunodeficiency virus positivity due to the potential for decreased tolerance, and potential to be at risk for severe side effects with immunotherapies. These concerns are relevant to all drugs, as drug-drug interactions among antiretrovirals and immunotherapies are yet uncharacterized.\n* Chronic administration (defined as daily or every other day for continued use greater than 14 days) of systemic corticosteroids or other immune suppressive drugs, within 28 days before treatment on study. Nasal, or inhaled steroid, topical steroid creams and eye drops for small body areas are allowed. Physiologic doses of steroids are permitted, e.g. a participant taking hydrocortisone for adrenal insufficiency or a patient recently on abiraterone (administered with 10 mg of prednisone daily) who is tapering off of prednisone is allowed to continue that taper.\n* Participants who have undergone allogeneic peripheral stem cell transplantation, or solid organ transplantation requiring immunosuppression\n\n  * Active autoimmune disease, except participants with type 1 diabetes mellitus, vitiligo, psoriasis, hypo- or hyperthyroid disease not requiring current immunosuppression, or with other endocrine disorders on replacement hormones or are not excluded if the condition is well controlled.\n\nProstate cancer participants with a history of brain/leptomeningeal metastasis, since these participants have a very poor prognosis and immunotherapy may take time to lead to beneficial clinical effects. Participants with brain or CNS metastases enrolling to arm 1.1 are eligible if they are status post definitive radiotherapy or surgery, and are asymptomatic\n\nHistory of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to study agents to be used in the cohort the subject will be enrolled into.\n\nKnown allergy to eggs, egg products, aminoglycoside antibiotics (for example, gentamicin or tobramycin).\n\nAny condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, would prevent full participation in this trial (including the long-term follow-up), or would interfere with the evaluation of the trial endpoints.\n\nParticipants with prior investigational drug, chemotherapy, immunotherapy or any prior radiotherapy (except for palliative bone directed therapy) within the past 28 days prior to enrollment, except if the investigator has assessed that all residual treatment-related toxicities have resolved or are minimal and feel the participant is otherwise suitable for enrollment.\n\nUncontrolled intercurrent acute or chronic illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure (>New York Heart Association Class I), hepatic disease, unstable angina pectoris, serious cardiac arrhythmia, requiring medication, uncontrolled hypertension (SBP>170/ DBP>105) or psychiatric illness/social situations within 12 months that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n\nUse of herbal products that may decrease PSA levels (e.g. saw palmetto)\n\nParticipants who have had cytotoxic chemotherapy for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer within the past 3 months. (Participants who have had docetaxel for metastatic castration sensitive per CHAARTED data may enroll as long as they did not have progressive disease while on docetaxel and are 3 months removed from treatment, with all treatment related toxicities resolving to at least grade 1.)\n\nParticipants who have undergone major surgery within 4 weeks of enrollment. A biopsy will not preclude a participant from starting study.\n\nParticipants with a history of hepatitis B (HBV) are excluded due to potential risk for viral reactivation and resulting liver injury in persons with latent HBV\n\nSubjects unwilling to accept blood products or blood transfusions as medically indicated. As there is a risk of severe bleeding with M7824, participants must be willing to receive blood transfusions if medically necessary for their own safety\n\nFor participants enrolling in Arm 2.3A and for participants who may be randomized to Arm 2.3B, the following additional exclusion criteria will apply:\n\n* Subjects receiving Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) or a drug which has significant MAOI activity (meperidine, linezolid, methylene blue) within the 21 days before initiation of study therapy are excluded.\n* Since epacadostat s metabolism may be altered by drugs that inhibit UDP- glucuronosyltransferase UGT1A9 (see Appendix D), Participants receiving such drugs within 21 days of initiation of study therapy are excluded.\n* Participants receiving agents that are substrates of CYP1A2, CYP2C8, and CYP2C19 or affected by OATP1B1 or OATP1B3 within 21 days of initiation of study therapy or 5 half lives of the agent (whichever is shorter) are excluded. Participants receiving medications that are substrates of these enzymes/transporters but are not listed in the appendix or participants receiving substrates of CYP2B6 and CYP3A will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis prior to enrollment. Participants who consume caffeine are eligible but must agree to moderate consumption.\n* Subjects receiving coumarin-based anticoagulants (e. Coumadin) are excluded.\n* Subjects having any history of Serotonin Syndrome (SS) after receiving serotonergic drugs are excluded.\n\n  --Participants with a QTcF interval > 480 milliseconds at the screening are excluded. In the event that a single QTcF is > 480 milliseconds, the subject may enroll if the average QTcF for the 3 ECGs is < 480 milliseconds. For subjects with an intraventricular conduction delay (QRS interval > 120 milliseconds), the JTc interval may be used in place of the QTc. The JTc must be < 340 milliseconds if JTc is used in place of the QTc. QTc prolongation due to pacemaker may enroll if the JTc is normal.\n* Subjects with left bundle branch block are excluded.\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because investigational agents used in this study (BN-Brachyury, M7824, N-803, and/or Epacadostat) could have teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with these investigational agen s, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with either of them.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 120 Years",
