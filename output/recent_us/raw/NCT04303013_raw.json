    "inclusion_criteria": "Glioma Cohort\n\n* Adult (> 18 years old) patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent high grade glioma with newly confirmed pathology (within 1 month)\n* Able to provide informed consent\n* No contraindications to MRI with gadolinium contrast or 18F-FAZA PET\n\nCervical Cohort\n\n* Adult (>18 years old) female with newly diagnosed cervical cancer\n* Able to provide informed consent\n* Receiving surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy\n* No contraindication to MRI with gadolinium contrast or 18F-FAZA PET\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "Glioma Cohort\n\n* Prior nephrectomy or planned nephrectomy.\n* Prior brain radiation within 30 days.\n* Pregnant or lactating women: Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the effects of 18F-FAZA in pregnancy are not known. A urine or serum pregnancy test will be performed before enrollment after informed consent is obtained. The pregnancy test is part of SOC before imaging.\n* Lactation should be suspended for at least two days following the administration of 18F-FAZA to the mother, because of the unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to administration of the radionuclide to a lactating woman.\n* Subjects with contraindications to the use of 18F-FAZA including confirmed allergy.\n* Patients with a body weight of 400 pounds or more, or a BMI which precludes their entry into the bore of the PET-MRI scanner, because the findings will probably be compromised in image quality with PET-MRI.\n* Any additional medical condition, serious concurrent illness, or other extenuating circumstance that, in the opinion of the investigator may significantly interfere with study compliance.\n\nCervical Cohort\n\n* Prior nephrectomy or planned nephrectomy.\n* Pregnant or lactating women: Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the effects of 18F-FAZA in pregnancy are not known.
