    "exclusion_criteria": "Patients are excluded from the study if any of the following criteria apply, unless medically indicated and after approval by study chair/IRB office:\n\n1. Has NSCLC with an oncogenic driver mutation (mutation[s] in EGFR, ERBB2, or BRAF V600E; fusion/rearrangement[s] in ALK, ROS1, NTRK, or RET; or MET amplification). KRAS or PIK3CA mutation are allowed.\n2. Has hepatocellular carcinoma. NOTE: patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and brain metastasis are excluded from this trial because the dose of lenvatinib approved for this disease is different than the ones used in this trial.\n3. Has symptomatic or untreated spinal cord compression. Patients with clinical or radiographic evidence of leptomeningeal metastases or other metastatic systemic disease are not allowed. In cases where brain metastases are superficially located (cortical-based brain metastasis) and leptomeningeal spread is suspected, a work-up for leptomeningeal disease (LMD) should be performed (MRI and lumbar puncture with CSF cytology). If LMD is not confirmed, the treating physician, neuro-oncologist, or brain metastasis multidisciplinary team should make a clinical call and exclude the patient if LMD dissemination is likely.\n4. Has received prior therapy with lenvatinib or other antiangiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitor alone or in combination with a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor. Prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD L2, or anti-CTLA-4 agent or chemotherapy is allowed.\n5. Has received prior systemic anticancer therapy including investigational agents within 28 days prior to study treatment initiation.\n\n   * Patients must have recovered from all AEs due to previous therapies to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline. Patients with ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy may be eligible. Patients with immunotherapy-related AEs of a permanent nature but manageable (hypothyroidism on thyroid hormone replacement, vitiligo, etc.) are eligible.\n   * Patients must have recovered adequately from any complications from major surgery. Withhold lenvatinib treatment for at least 1 week prior to elective surgery. Do not administer lenvatinib for at least 2 weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing.\n6.
