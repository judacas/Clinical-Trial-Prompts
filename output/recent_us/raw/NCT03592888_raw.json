    "inclusion_criteria": "Randomized Cohort:\n\n1. Must be >/= 15 years of age at the time of enrollment\n2. Must be able to provide written consent and complete the informed consent\n3. Must have received allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation within 60-180 days prior to randomization\n4. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) seropositive or had a donor who was CMV positive\n5. One or both of the following:\n\n   * CMV event* within the first 100 days post-transplant requiring anti-viral treatment\n   * Receipt of CMV prophylaxis**(for at least 30 days) prior to randomization. Continuation of letermovir or acyclovir/valacyclovir (high and low dose) prophylaxis after day 100 per institutional standard of care is permitted * CMV event defined as deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) detection or disease ** Anti-viral treatment or prophylaxis includes ganciclovir, valganciclovir, foscarnet, letermovir, maribavir or acyclovir/valacyclovir (high and low dose)\n6. Direct availability to the internet either by a computer in the residence or a smart phone\n7. Had at least one or more of these conditions:\n\n   * HLA mismatch*\n   * umbilical cord blood source**\n   * Graft versus host disease (GVHD)***\n   * T-cell depletion**** * Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-related (sibling) donor with at least one mismatch at one of the following three HLA-gene loci: HLA-A, -B, or -DR, Haploidentical donor, Unrelated donor with at least one mismatch at one of the following four HLA-gene loci: HLA-A, -B, -C and -DRB1\n\n     * Use of umbilical cord blood as stem cell source ***Acute or chronic GVHD requiring topical steroid for gastrointestinal (GI) GVHD and/or systemic steroid treatment (>/= 1 mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent dose of another corticosteroid) within 6 weeks prior to enrollment\n\n       * Subjects who have received partial or full T-cell depletion (with or without GVHD). T-cell depletion can be given as either ex-vivo or in-vivo for GVHD prophylaxis. T-cell depleting agents include, but are not limited to, anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) and alemtuzumab\n\nObservation Cohort:\n\n1. Must be >/= 15 years of age at the time of enrollment\n2. Must have one of the following:\n\n   * Consented for retrospective studies at their transplant center, or\n   * Be included under the auspices of the site's IRB approved waiver of additional consent for retrospective studies\n3. Must have received allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation during or within 1 year prior to the conduct of the randomized trial (defined as time during which randomization is done)\n4. CMV seropositive or had a donor who was CMV positive\n5. One or both of the following:\n\n   * CMV event* within the first 100 days post-transplant requiring anti-viral treatment\n   * Receipt of CMV prophylaxis**(for at least 30 days) prior to registration. Continuation of letermovir prophylaxis or acyclovir/valacyclovir (high and low dose) after day 100 per institutional standard of care is permitted * CMV event defined as DNA detection or disease ** Anti-viral treatment or prophylaxis includes ganciclovir, valganciclovir, foscarnet, letermovir, maribavir or acyclovir/valacyclovir (high and low dose)\n6. Meet at least one or more of criteria of the following:\n\n   * HLA mismatch*\n   * umbilical cord blood source**\n   * GVHD***\n   * T-cell depletion****\n\n     * Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-related (sibling) donor with at least one mismatch at one of the following three HLA-gene loci: HLA-A, -B, or -DR, Haploidentical donor, Unrelated donor with at least one mismatch at one of the following four HLA-gene loci: HLA-A, -B, -C and -DRB1\n\n       * Use of umbilical cord blood as stem cell source ***Acute or chronic GVHD requiring topical steroid for GI GVHD and/or systemic steroid treatment (>/= 1 mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent dose of another corticosteroid) within 6 weeks prior to enrollment ****Subjects who have received partial or full T-cell depletion (with or without GVHD). T-cell depletion can be given as either ex-vivo or in-vivo for GVHD prophylaxis.
