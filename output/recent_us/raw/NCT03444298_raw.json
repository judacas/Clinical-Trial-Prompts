These subjects are not excluded).\n8. Evidence of clinically significant immunosuppression such as the following:\n\n   1. Primary immunodeficiency state such as Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Disease (SCID)\n   2. Concurrent opportunistic infection\n9. Presence of uncontrolled pleural effusion, pericardial effusion or ascites requiring recurrent drainage procedures (monthly or more frequently).\n10. Has received prior anticancer treatment with the following therapies (specified time periods are from last dose of prior treatment to first dose of NM1F):\n\n    1. Any therapy directed against PVRIG (COM701 or other anti-PVRIG mAb) or other CD226 axis receptor (TIGIT or CD96) at any time.\n    2. Chemotherapy, target therapy, immunotherapy, or other anticancer therapy within 28 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter, prior to the first dose of study treatment.\n    3. Prior radiotherapy ≤ 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment, with the exception of a single fraction of radiotherapy for the purposes of palliation, which is permitted.\n    4. Investigational therapy: if the subject has participated in a clinical study and has received an investigational product within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment.\n11. Has received systematic immunomodulatory drugs within 14 days before the first dose of study drug, such as thymosin, IL-2, IFN.\n12.

Subjects who have experienced Grade ≥ 3 irAEs from prior immunotherapies or who discontinue immunotherapy due to immune-related toxicities.\n16. Has a known psychiatric or substance abuse disorder that would interfere with the subject's ability to cooperate with the requirements of the study.\n17. Pregnancy or lactation.
