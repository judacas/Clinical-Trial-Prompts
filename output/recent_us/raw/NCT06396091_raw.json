    "inclusion_criteria": "* Has a histologically- or cytologically-confirmed early stage or advanced/ metastatic solid tumor by pathology report and meet the following conditions based on tumor type:\n\n  * Surgically resected Stage IIB and IIC (pathological or clinical), or III cutaneous melanoma per American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) eighth edition.\n  * Surgically resected renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with intermediate-high or high risk of recurrence as defined by the Fuhrman grading status.\n  * Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) per AJCC eight edition, with an anti-programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) tumor proportion score (TPS) ≥50% determined using the Dako PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) 22C3 pharmDx diagnostic kit, and confirmation that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR-), anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK-), or c-ros oncogene 1 (ROS1)- directed therapy is not indicated as primary therapy.\n* Has a life expectancy of at least 3 months.\n* Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected participants must have well controlled HIV on antiretroviral therapy (ART).\n* Participants who are hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive are eligible if they have received hepatitis B virus (HBV) antiviral therapy for at least 4 weeks, and have undetectable HBV viral load before randomization.\n* Participants with history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are eligible if have completed curative antiviral therapy at least 4 weeks before randomization and HCV viral load is undetectable at screening.\n* Has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1 assessed within 3 days before the start of study intervention.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) participants with a diagnosis of small cell lung cancer or, for mixed tumors, presence of small cell elements.\n* Melanoma participants with ocular, mucosal, or conjunctival melanoma.\n* Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) participants who have had major surgery, other than nephrectomy, within 12 weeks before randomization.\n* Has received prior radiotherapy for RCC.\n* RCC participants who have residual thrombus post nephrectomy in the vena renalis or vena cava.\n* Has received prior therapy with an anti-programmed cell death 1 protein (PD-1), PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent, or with an agent directed to another stimulatory or coinhibitory T-cell receptor (eg, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), OX-40, CD137).\n* Has received prior systemic anticancer therapy including investigational agents within 4 weeks before randomization.\n* Has received a live or live-attenuated vaccine within 30 days before the first dose of study intervention. Administration of killed vaccines is allowed.\n* Received prior radiotherapy within 2 weeks of start of study intervention, or has radiation-related toxicities, requiring corticosteroids.\n* Received prior systemic anticancer therapy for their metastatic NSCLC. Note: Prior treatment with neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy for nonmetastatic NSCLC is allowed as long as therapy was completed at least 12 months before diagnosis of metastatic NSCLC.\n* Received radiation therapy to the lung that is >30 Gray within 6 months of start of study intervention.\n* Has received an investigational agent or has used an investigational device within 4 weeks prior to study intervention administration.\n* Has diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior the first dose of study medication.\n* Has known additional malignancy that is progressing or has required active treatment within the past 3 years.\n* Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis.\n* Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years.\n* Has history of (noninfectious) pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease that required steroids or has current pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease.\n* Has active infection requiring systemic therapy.\n* HIV-infected participants with a history of Kaposi's sarcoma and/or Multicentric Castleman's Disease.\n* Has history of allogeneic tissue/solid organ transplant corticosteroids.\n* Has severe hypersensitivity (≥Grade 3) to pembrolizumab and/or any of its excipients.\n* Has not adequately recovered from major surgery or have ongoing surgical complications.",
