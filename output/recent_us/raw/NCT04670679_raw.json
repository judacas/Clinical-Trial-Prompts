Patients transplanted for another indication (e.g., myelodysplastic syndrome/chronic myelomonocytic leukemia [MDS/CMML]) who relapse with AML are eligible to enroll\n* White blood cells (WBC) must be less than 25,000/ul for at least three days prior to cycle 1, day 1 (C1D1) (hydroxyurea allowed)\n* A bone marrow biopsy must be performed and tissue collected for entrance to the trial\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status of 0 - 2\n* Alanine transaminase (ALT) serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) and/or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) less than or equal to 3x upper limit of normal (ULN)\n* Total bilirubin < 1.5 x ULN\n\n  * Patients with Gilbert's syndrome (hereditary indirect hyperbilirubinemia) must have a total bilirubin of < 3 x ULN\n* Calculated creatinine clearance >= 30 ml/min (per the Cockroft-Gault formula)\n* Willingness to abide by all study requirements, including contraception, maintenance of a pill diary, and acceptance of recommended supportive care medications\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Prior relapse or progression while receiving venetoclax or other commercially available or investigational BCL-2 inhibitor\n* Anticancer therapy, including investigational agents =< 2 weeks or =< 5 half-lives of the drug, whichever is shorter, prior to C1D1. (Use of hydroxyurea is permitted)\n* Inadequate recovery from toxicity attributed to prior anti-cancer therapy to =< Grade 1 (National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [NCI CTCAE] version [v]5.0), excluding alopecia or fatigue\n* History of allogeneic HCT, or other cellular therapy product, within 3 months of signing consent\n* Clinically active acute or chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD). Patients must be off calcineurin inhibitors for at least 4 weeks to be eligible\n* Radiation therapy or major surgery within 3 weeks of signing consent\n* Active, uncontrolled infection. Patients with infection under active treatment and controlled with antibiotics are eligible. Prophylaxis is acceptable\n* Inability to tolerate oral medication, presence of poorly controlled gastrointestinal disease, or dysfunction that could affect study drug absorption\n* Active documented central nervous system leukemia\n* Concurrent treatment with a non-permitted concomitant medication\n* Other malignancy IF currently being treated or likely to be treated in next 6 months except for basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or cervical carcinoma in situ\n* Pregnancy or breastfeeding females\n* Known chronic alcohol or drug abuse\n* Clinically significant cardiovascular disease with major event or cardiac intervention within the past 6 months (e.g. percutaneous intervention, coronary artery bypass graft, documented cardiac heart failure) as determined by the investigator\n* Any other condition deemed by the investigator to make the patient a poor candidate for clinical trial and/or treatment with investigational agents",
