    "inclusion_criteria": "* Have a diagnosis of Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) for at least 6 months before the first administration of study agent and meet Classification criteria for Psoriatic Arthritis (CASPAR) at screening\n* Have active PsA as defined by: at least 3 swollen joints and at least 3 tender joints at screening and at baseline; and C-reactive protein (CRP) greater than or equal to (>=) 0.3 milligram per deciLitre (mg/dL) at screening from the central laboratory\n* Have at least 1 of the PsA subsets: distal interphalangeal joint involvement, polyarticular arthritis with absence of rheumatoid nodules, arthritis mutilans, asymmetric peripheral arthritis, or spondylitis with peripheral arthritis\n* Have active plaque psoriasis, with at least one psoriatic plaque of >= 2 centimeter (cm) diameter or nail changes consistent with psoriasis or documented history of plaque psoriasis\n* Have active PsA despite previous non-biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD), apremilast, and/or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) therapy : Non-biologic DMARD therapy is defined as taking a non-biologic DMARD for at least 3 months or evidence of intolerance; Apremilast therapy is defined as taking apremilast at the marketed dose approved in the country where the study is being conducted for at least 4 months or evidence of intolerance; NSAID therapy is defined as taking an NSAID for at least 4 weeks or evidence of intolerance\n* Participants may have been previously treated with up to 2 anti-TNF (tumor necrosis factor) alpha agents (approximately 30 percent [%] of the overall study population), and must document the reason for discontinuation\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Has other inflammatory diseases that might confound the evaluations of benefit of guselkumab therapy, including but not limited to rheumatoid arthritis (RA), axial spondyloarthritis (this does not include a primary diagnosis of PsA with spondylitis), systemic lupus erythematosus, or Lyme disease\n* Has ever received more than 2 anti-TNFalpha agents\n* Has previously received any biologic treatment (other than anti-TNF alpha agents), including, but not limited to ustekinumab, abatacept, secukinumab, tildrakizumab, ixekizumab, brodalumab, risankizumab, or other investigative biologic treatment\n* Has previously received any systemic immunosuppressants (for example, azathioprine, cyclosporine, 6 thioguanine, mercaptopurine, mycophenolate mofetil, hydroxyurea, tacrolimus) within 4 weeks of the first administration of study agent\n* Has received apremilast within 4 weeks prior to the first administration of study agent\n* Has previously received tofacitinib, baricitinib, filgotinib, peficitinib (ASP015K), decernotinib (VX-509), or any other Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor",
