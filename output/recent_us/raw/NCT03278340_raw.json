Furthermore, changes in laboratory parameters during the study should not be considered adverse events unless they meet criteria for dose modification(s) of study medication outlined by the protocol and/or worsen from baseline during therapy\n* Bilirubin =< 3.0 x upper limit of normal (ULN). Subjects with Gilbert's syndrome may be enrolled despite a total bilirubin level > 3.0 mg/dL if their conjugated bilirubin is =< 3.0 x ULN) (obtained within 14 days prior to initiating study treatment)\n\n  * Note: Hematology and other lab parameters that are =< grade 2 BUT still meet criteria for study entry are allowed.

Furthermore, changes in laboratory parameters during the study should not be considered adverse events unless they meet criteria for dose modification(s) of study medication outlined by the protocol and/or worsen from baseline during therapy\n* Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 3 days prior to registration. NOTE: Females are considered of childbearing potential unless they are surgically sterile (have undergone a hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or they are naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months. Documentation of postmenopausal status must be provided\n* Females of childbearing potential must be willing to abstain from heterosexual activity or to use 2 forms of effective methods of contraception from the time of informed consent until 12 months after treatment the last dose of rituximab or tafasitamab. The two contraception methods can be comprised of two barrier methods, or a barrier method plus a hormonal method or an intrauterine device that meets < 1% failure rate for protection from pregnancy in the product label\n* Male subjects with female partners must have had a prior vasectomy or agree to use an adequate method of contraception (i.e., double barrier method: condom plus spermicidal agent) starting with the first dose of study therapy through 12 months after the last dose of rituximab\n* Subjects with prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the experimental regimen are eligible for the trial\n* Subject is willing and able to comply with study procedures based on the judgement of the investigator or protocol designee\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Uncontrolled active infection.
