    "exclusion_criteria": "* Patients with SCNSL actively receiving treatment for extra-CNS disease are excluded.\n* Patient is concurrently using other approved or investigational antineoplastic agents.\n* Patient has received chemotherapy, monoclonal antibodies or targeted anticancer therapy ≤ 4 weeks or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter, or 6 weeks for nitrosourea or mitomycin-C prior to starting the study drug, or the patient has not recovered from the side effects of such therapy.\n* Patient has received external beam radiation therapy to the CNS within 21 days of the first dose of the study drug.\n* Patient requires more than 8 mg of dexamethasone daily or the equivalent\n* Patient has an active concurrent malignancy requiring active therapy\n* The patient has been treated with radio- or toxin-immunoconjugates within 70 days of the first dose of the study drug.\n* Patient is allergic to components of the study drug.\n* Patient is using warfarin or any other Coumadin-derivative anticoagulant or vitamin K antagonists. Patients must be off warfarin-derivative anticoagulants for at least seven days prior to starting the study drug. Low molecular weight heparin is allowed.
