    "official_title": "A Phase 4 Randomized, Active-Comparator Controlled Clinical Trial to Study the Safety of Sugammadex (MK-8616) for the Reversal of Neuromuscular Blockade Induced by Either Rocuronium Bromide or Vecuronium Bromide in American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Class 3 or 4 Subjects",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Has a body mass index (BMI) < 40 kg/m2.\n* Is categorized as ASA Physical Status Class 3 or 4, as determined by the Investigator.\n* Has a planned surgical procedure that requires NMB with either rocuronium or vecuronium.\n* Has a planned surgical procedure (e.g., gastrointestinal, urologic, or laparoscopic) that in the opinion of the investigator does not preclude maintenance of moderate or deep depth of NMB throughout the case.\n* If female who is not of reproductive potential, is one of the following: (1) postmenopausal; (2) has had a hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, or bilateral tubal ligation/occlusion at least 6 weeks prior to screening; (3) has a congenital or acquired condition that prevents childbearing; or (4) is undergoing surgical sterilization (e.g., hysterectomy or tubal ligation) as the planned surgical procedure associated with participation in this study.\n* If female who is sexually active and of child-bearing potential, agrees to use a medically accepted method of contraception through seven days after receiving protocol-specified medication. Abstinence (relative to heterosexual activity) can be used as the sole method of contraception if it is consistently employed as the subject's preferred and usual lifestyle and if considered acceptable by local regulatory agencies and Ethics Review Committees/Institutional Review Boards.\n* Is able to provide (or the participant's legally authorized representative, in accordance with local requirements), written informed consent for the trial. The participant or legally authorized representative may also provide consent for Future Biomedical Research.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
