    "official_title": "Focused Ultrasound With Low-Dose Gemcitabine to Augment Immune Control of Early Stage Breast Cancer",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Disease Status\n\n  * Patients must have histologically confirmed, newly diagnosed breast cancer, stage 1-3\n  * If genomic profiling is performed, then the results must indicate that the cancer is high-risk\n  * Any receptor status may be eligible (estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, HER2 receptor)\n  * Patients must have a lesion in the breast/chest wall/axilla that is accessible to focused ultrasound ablation.\n* Willing and able to provide written consent\n* Stated willingness to comply with all study procedures and availability for the duration of the study.\n* Male or female, ≥ 18 years\n* Be willing to provide tissue from a newly obtained core or excisional biopsy of a tumor lesion.\n* ECOG performance status of 0-2\n* Adequate organ function\n* Agreement to adhere to lifestyle considerations throughout the study duration\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Received other treatment (standard or investigational) for their current breast cancer.\n* Pregnant or lactating\n* Diagnosis of immunodeficiency or receiving systemic steroid therapy within 7 days prior to enrollment with the following exceptions:\n\n  * In patients with adrenal or pituitary insufficiency replacement steroid doses are allowed; however, daily doses of 10 mg or more of prednisone (or equivalent) per day administered parenterally or orally are not allowed in patients with normal adrenal and pituitary function.\n  * Inhaled steroids (e.g.: Advair®, Flovent®, Azmacort®) are permitted at low doses (less than 500 mcg fluticasone per day, or equivalent).\n  * Topical, nasal, and intra-articular corticosteroids are acceptable.\n* Known allergic reactions to gemcitabine\n* Breast implant on the side of the body that will receive HIFU application\n* Known history of HIV (Patients with HIV will be excluded because immunotherapy may impact the T cell profiling as part of the biologic correlates and the natural history of the disease)\n* Known active Hepatitis B virus or Hepatitis C virus\n* Other malignancy other than basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that is undergoing potentially curative therapy, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), or in situ cervical cancer\n* Active infection requiring other systemic therapy\n* Participants in whom there is a medical contraindication or potential problem in complying with the requirements of the protocol in the opinion of the investigator.\n* Any condition(s) or diagnosis, both physical or psychological, or physical exam finding that precludes participation",
