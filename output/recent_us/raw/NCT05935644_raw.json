    "inclusion_criteria": "Each patient must meet the following criteria to be enrolled in this study.\n\n1. AL amyloidosis Mayo stage I, II or IIIa\n2. For Part A only, measurable hematologic disease defined by at least one of the following:\n\n   1. involved/uninvolved free light chain difference (dFLC) > 5mg/dL or\n   2. free light chain (FLC) > 5mg/dL with abnormal Kappa/Lambda ratio or\n   3. serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) m- spike > 0.5 g/dL Patients with confirmed AL amyloid diagnosis without measurable disease may be enrolled with consultation and approval by the Sponsor Medical Monitor or their designee.\n3. a. For Part A, currently on and continuing OR planned to start concurrent chemotherapy with CyBorD administered weekly as SoC. b. For Part B, currently on and continuing OR planned to start concurrent chemotherapy with CyBorD and daratumumab administered as SoC.\n\nKey\nHealthy volunteers allowed",
    "exclusion_criteria": "Patients who meet any of the following criteria will not be permitted entry to the study.\n\n1. Any form of secondary, hereditary, senile, localized, dialysis-related or leukocyte chemotactic factor 2-related (ALECT2) amyloidosis\n2. Meets the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) definition of multiple myeloma. Patients with signs and/or symptoms attributable ONLY to amyloidosis and who do NOT meet IMWG definition of smoldering myeloma may be enrolled upon approval of the medical monitor.\n3. Supine systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg or symptomatic orthostatic hypotension, defined as a decrease in systolic blood pressure upon standing of > 20 mmHg despite medical management (e.g., midodrine, fludrocortisones) in the absence of volume depletion\n4. Receiving dialysis\n5. Myocardial infarction, uncontrolled angina, severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias, or percutaneous cardiac intervention with recent stent, coronary artery bypass grafting or major cerebrovascular accident within 6 months prior to screening\n6. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 45 percent by echocardiogram or multigated acquisition scan (MUGA)",
