    "exclusion_criteria": "* Has received anti-cancer chemotherapy (including molecular-targeted drugs), radiotherapy (therapeutic or curative intent) or hormonal therapy within 14 days before the first dose of ALG.APV-527; however, the following are permitted:\n\n  * Hormonal therapy with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists or antagonists for prostate cancer\n  * Hormone-replacement therapy or oral contraceptives\n  * Herbal therapy intended as anti-cancer ≥ 1 week prior to first dose of ALG.APV-527\n  * Palliative radiotherapy for bone metastases within 2 weeks prior to first dose of ALG.APV-527\n* Has received immunotherapy (e.g., CAR T-cell therapy, T-cell redirecting bispecific antibodies, mono-specific antibodies, vaccines or cytokines), or investigational agents within 28 days before the first dose of ALG.APV-527.\n* Receives concurrent systemic (oral or IV) steroid therapy >10 mg methylprednisolone daily or its equivalent for an underlying, non-cancer condition.
