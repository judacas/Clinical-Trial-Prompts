    "official_title": "A Phase 2, Randomized, Open-Label, 3-arm Study of Relacorilant in Combination With Nab-Paclitaxel for Patients With Recurrent Platinum-Resistant Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Signed and dated IRB/IEC-approved informed consent form (ICF) prior to study-specific screening procedures.\n* Female patients aged ≥ 18 years old at time of consent.\n* Histologic diagnosis of high grade serous or endometrioid epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer or ovarian carcinosarcoma. Clear cell, mucinous and borderline histologic subtypes are excluded.\n* Received at least one line of therapy with evidence of cancer progression within 6 months after the last dose of platinum-based therapy (i.e., having a platinum-free interval of <6 months [platinum resistant]), or progressive disease during or immediately after primary platinum-therapy, (i.e.platinum refractory). Patients with primary platinum resistance (progression within 6 months of the last dose of first-line platinum-containing chemotherapy) are considered eligible.\n\nNotes: For the calculation of the platinum-free interval, cancer progression must be defined by clear evidence of progression, such as radiographic progression per RECIST v1.1. Calculating the platinum-free interval on the basis of increased CA-125 is not allowed.\n\n* Measurable or non-measurable disease by RECIST v1.1:\n* Previously irradiated lesions are not allowed as measurable disease, unless there is documented evidence of progression in the lesions.\n* To be eligible with non-measurable disease, patients must have evaluable disease with CA 125 at least twice the upper limit of reference range (of CA-125 ≥ 70 U/mL), along with radiographically evaluable disease by CT/MRI.\n* Availability and consent to provide tumor tissue for biomarker assays (archival or recent biopsy).\n* No more than 4 prior chemotherapeutic or myelosuppressive regimens (not including maintenance therapy such as single-agent bevacizumab or poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase [PARP] inhibitor). Patients with platinum-refractory cancer cannot have had more than 2 prior lines of treatment for refractory disease.\n* Appropriate to treat with nab-paclitaxel, in the opinion of the Investigator.\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1.\n* Adequate organ and bone marrow function meeting the following criteria at the Screening Visit:\n\n  * Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,500 cells/mm3.\n  * Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3.\n  * Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL.\n  * AST or ALT ≤ 2.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) (or ≤ 5 × ULN in the context of liver metastasis).\n  * Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × ULN.\n  * Creatinine clearance ≥ 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 (measured or estimated).\n  * Albumin ≥ 3 g/dL (≥ 30 g/L) .\n* If patient has undergone surgery of the gastrointestinal or hepatobiliary tract, adequate absorption as evidenced by: albumin ≥ 3.0 g/dL, controlled pancreatic insufficiency (if present), and lack of malabsorption.\n* Able to swallow and retain oral medication and does not have uncontrolled emesis.\n* Able to comply with protocol requirements.\n* Negative pregnancy test for patients of childbearing potential. Patients of childbearing potential must use appropriate precautions to avoid pregnancy, defined as of non-childbearing potential (ie, postmenopausal or permanently sterilized) or using highly effective contraception with low user-dependency, for at least 3 months after the last dose of relacorilant, or per the duration indicated in the product label for nab-paclitaxel, whichever is latest. A woman is postmenopausal if it is more than 12 months since her last menstruation, without an alternative medical cause. Accepted methods of permanent sterilization methods are hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy. Accepted methods of highly effective contraception with low user-dependency are:\n\n  * An IUD, provided that the subject has tolerated its use for at least 3 months before the first dose of study medication and undertakes not to have it removed for 1 month after the last dose.\n  * Abstinence from heterosexual intercourse, when it is in line with the subject's preferred and usual lifestyle. Periodic abstinence and withdrawal are NOT acceptable.\n  * Vasectomized partner provided that the partner is the sole sexual partner of the trial participant and that the vasectomized partner has received medical assessment of the surgical success.\n  * Oral hormonal contraceptives are NOT permitted.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be FEMALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Clinically relevant toxicity from prior systemic anticancer therapies or radiotherapy that in the opinion of the Investigator has not resolved to Grade 1 or less prior to randomization.\n* Any major surgery within 4 weeks prior to randomization. If subject received major surgery including (curative or palliative surgery), they must have recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting therapy.\n* Treatment with the following prior to randomization:\n\n  * Concurrent treatment with other anticancer therapy including other chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, chemoembolization, targeted therapy, an investigational agent or the non-approved use of a drug or device within 28 days before the first dose of study drug.\n  * Hormonal anticancer therapies within 7 days of the first dose of study drug.\n  * Systemic, inhaled, or prescription strength topical corticosteroids within 21 days of the first dose of study drug. Short courses (≤ 5 days) for non-cancer-related reasons are allowed if clinically required (such as prophylaxis for CT).\n* Received radiation to more than 25% of marrow-bearing areas.\n* Toxicities of prior therapies (except alopecia) that have not resolved to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) v5.0 ≤ Grade 1.\n* Requirement for treatment with chronic or frequently used oral corticosteroids for medical conditions or illnesses (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, immunosuppression after organ transplantation).\n* History of severe hypersensitivity or severe reaction to either study drug.\n* Peripheral neuropathy from any cause > Grade 1.\n* Pregnant or lactating patients or patients expecting to conceive children within the projected duration of the trial, starting with the screening visit through at least 3 months after the last dose of relacorilant, or per the duration indicated in the product label for nab-paclitaxel, whichever is latest.\n* Human immunodeficiency virus or current chronic/active infection with hepatitis C virus or hepatitis B virus, including:\n\n  * Patients with chronic or active hepatitis B as diagnosed by serologic tests are excluded from the study. In equivocal cases, hepatitis B or C polymerase chain reaction may be performed and must be negative for enrollment.\n* Patient has a clinically significant uncontrolled condition(s) or which in the opinion of the Investigator may confound the results of the trial or interfere with the patient's participation, including but not limited to:\n\n  * Unstable angina pectoris, angioplasty, cardiac stenting, or myocardial infarction 6 months before study entry.\n  * Uncontrolled hypertension (sustained systolic blood pressure > 150 mmHg or diastolic pressure > 100 mmHg despite optimal management). Patients will be considered eligible if hypertension is treated and controlled during Screening.\n  * Active infection that requires parenteral antibiotics.\n  * Bowel obstruction or gastric outlet obstruction.\n  * Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial.\n* Untreated parenchymal central nervous system metastases.\n* Any other concurrent cancer or a history of another invasive malignancy within the last 3 years that has a likelihood of recurrence of > 30% within the next 5 years. Adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancers or non-muscle invasive urothelial cancer or other tumors curatively treated with no evidence of disease are permissible.\n* Are taking a concomitant medication that is a strong CYP3A inhibitor or inducer, or that is a substrate of CYP3A with a narrow therapeutic window.\n* Concurrent treatment with mifepristone or other glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonists.\n* Drugs with a narrow therapeutic ratio that are highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance should be avoided. Caution should be exercised when co-administering known inhibitors of CYP3A with relacorilant. Medicines/food known to strongly inhibit CYP3A should be avoided.\n* Concurrent treatment on other investigational treatment studies for the treatment of ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.\n* Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. Note: Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.",
