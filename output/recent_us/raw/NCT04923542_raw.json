    "inclusion_criteria": "* Subjects will be eligible for enrollment in the study if they meet ONE criteria a, b or c in point 1 and ALL the criteria in points 2-9.\n\n  1. Subjects must meet ONE of the criteria a, b or c below:\n\n     1. For enrollment into Cohort A: Subjects with histologically confirmed advanced or metastatic non-uveal/non-mucosal melanoma or merkel cell carcinoma (MCPyV positive and negative) who are not amenable to surgical cure and are candidates to receive single- or combined IOT alone (not to include cytotoxic chemotherapy) as first or second line treatment.\n     2. For enrollment into Cohort B: Subjects with histologically confirmed advanced or metastatic clear cell Renal Cell Carcinoma or Renal Cell Carcinoma with sarcomatoid features (regardless of subtype) as defined on pathologic examination by a component of clear cell or sarcomatoid, who are not amenable to surgical cure and are candidates to receive single- or combined IOT alone or IOT in combination with VEGFR-directed or tyrosine kinase inhibitor (not to include cytotoxic chemotherapy) as first or second line treatment\n     3. For enrollment into Cohort C: Subjects with histologically confirmed advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer without non-smoker/driver mutations who are not amenable to surgical cure, and are candidates to receive single- or combined IOT alone (not to include cytotoxic chemotherapy) as first or second line treatment as per the label/prescribing information at the physicians discretion.\n\n     i. Patients with driver mutations that are expected to show significant benefit from first line checkpoint inhibiter treatment (such as KRAS G12C mutations) are eligible if all other I/E criteria are met\n\n     Subjects must meet All of the criteria 2-9 below:\n  2. At least 1 RECIST 1.1-measurable. non-irradiated, non-osseous (unless there is an associated measurable soft-tissue component) lesion documented on intravenous (IV) contrast-enhanced CT or MRI (per RECIST criteria 1.1) prior to first zirconium Zr 89 crefmirlimab berdoxam administration.\n  3. Has an adequate amount of time between their prior treatment/procedure and the 1st administration of zirconium Zr 89 crefmirlimab berdoxam.\n  4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤2 and anticipated survival of at least 6 months.\n  5. Meeting all clinical safety lab values per institution's SOC, or investigator's discretion, for subjects receiving cancer treatment.\n  6. Male or female age ≥18 years.\n  7. Ability to understand the purposes and risks of the trial and has signed an Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved informed consent form.\n  8. Willingness and ability to comply with all protocol required procedures.\n  9. For men and women of child-producing potential, use of effective double barrier contraceptive methods during the study, up to 30 days after the last administration of the investigational product.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Subjects will NOT be eligible for enrollment in the study if they meet ANY of the following criteria:\n\n  1. Bone-only disease without a measurable soft tissue component on conventional imaging (MRI, PET, CT).\n  2. Subjects with skin-only (cutaneous) lesions will be excluded from the tumor biopsy assessment.\n  3. Serious nonmalignant disease, additional active malignant disease or conditions that in the opinion of the investigator and/or ImaginAb could compromise protocol objectives.\n  4. Subjects with splenic dysfunction or who are status post splenectomy. Post-splenectomy subjects who develop an accessory spleen with clinical and radiographic evidence of splenic function will be allowed with prior approval from the Sponsor.\n  5. Corticosteroid therapy is prohibited if used for the treatment of inflammatory or autoimmune conditions. Patients with adrenal insufficiency from prior surgery or immunotherapy toxicity may be on standard chronic replacement doses of hydrocortisone that also require sporadic use of stress doses of steroid .\n  6. Pregnant women or nursing mothers.",
