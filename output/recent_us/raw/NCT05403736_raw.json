    "official_title": "Phase 1 Clinical Trial of Intra-tumoral Mitazalimab (CD40 Antibody) With Irreversible Electroporation (IRE) in Locally Advanced Pancreas Cancer",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Provision of signed and dated informed consent form\n* Stated willingness to comply with all study procedures and availability for the duration of the study\n* Histologically/cytologically-confirmed pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)\n* Persons, aged > 18 years of age, as PDAC is extremely rare in pediatric populations.\n* Locally advanced disease that is not amenable to surgical resection. Locally advanced PDAC cases will be identified per the definition developed by the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology[53]. Per this definition, locally advanced PDAC is defined as presence of any one or more of the following on CT:\n\n  * Occlusion of the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) and/or portal vein (PV) that is not amenable to resection and venous reconstruction\n  * Interface between tumor and hepatic artery that is not amenable to resection and reconstruction\n  * Interface between the tumor and superior mesenteric artery (SMA) measuring > 180º of the circumference of the vessel wall\n  * Interface between the tumor and celiac axis measuring > 180º of the circumference of the vessel wall that is not amenable to resection\n* ECOG Performance Status of 0-2\n* Have adequate organ function per criteria below:\n\n  * Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5x109/L\n  * Platelets ≥ 100x109/L\n  * Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL\n  * Serum creatinine ≤1.5 x ULN OR creatinine clearance ≥40 mL/min (as calculated by Modified Cockcroft-Gault formula)\n  * Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X ULN\n  * AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 X ULN\n* A minimum of 4 months of FOLFIRINOX-based systemic chemotherapy\n* High quality imaging triphasic CT scan contrast-enhanced dynamic MRI of abdomen and either contrast-enhanced or non-contrast CT of chest and pelvis that demonstrate no evidence of metastatic disease within 30 days of enrollment\n* FDG-PET imaging (skullbase-midthigh) at any timepoint between diagnosis and study intervention to determine whether tumor is PET-avid and evaluate for extra-pancreatic metastatic disease, as suggested by NCCN guidelines for high-risk patients.\n* Tumor amenable to \"in situ\" (complete) ablation with maximum primary tumor dimension < 4.0 cm\n* For participants able to become pregnant: use of highly effective contraception for at least 1 month prior to screening and agreement to use such a method until the study intervention and for an additional 1 month after the study intervention.\n* For participants able to cause a pregnancy: use of condoms or other methods to ensure effective contraception with partner for 1 month after study intervention.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Pregnancy or lactation\n* Known allergic reactions to components of the mitazalimab solution (L-Histidine, trehalose, or polysorbate 20)\n* Fever > 38 degrees C within 14 days of study intervention\n* Treatment with another investigational drug or other intervention within 30 days of enrollment\n* Prior treatment with a CD40 antibody\n* History of severe auto-immune disease\n* The presence of metal fiducials or embolization coils within the tumor.\n* Prior receipt of radiation therapy to the pancreas\n* The presence of implanted metallic cardiac stimulation devices within the chest\n* Uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmias that prevent synchronization of pulse delivery with the refractory period of the cardiac cycle\n* Immunosuppressive doses of systemic medications, such as corticosteroids or absorbed topical corticosteroids (doses > 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent) must be discontinued at least 2 weeks (14 days) before study treatment administration. Physiologic doses of corticosteroids (≤ 10 mg/day of prednisone or its equivalent) or short pulses of corticosteroids (≤ 3 days) may be permitted.\n* Any medical condition that precludes major abdominal surgery under general anesthesia\n* Presence of distant metastatic disease (including positive peritoneal cytology) on staging laparoscopy and/or exploratory laparotomy at any timepoint.",
