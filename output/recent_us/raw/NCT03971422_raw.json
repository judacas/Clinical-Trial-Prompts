Participants for whom newly obtained samples cannot be provided at baseline (e.g., inaccessible or subject safety concern), may submit an archived specimen, only upon agreement from the Prinicipal Investigator, if available).\n* A woman of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required.\n* A woman of childbearing potential must be willing to use 2 methods of birth control or be surgically sterile or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course of the study through 6 months after the last dose of study medication (participants of childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not been free from menses for > 1 year). Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.\n* Participant (or legal representative) must understand the investigational nature of this study and sign an Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board approved written informed consent form prior to receiving any study related procedure.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be FEMALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Receipt of any antibody targeting T cell checkpoint or co-stimulation pathways within 4 weeks, use of any other monoclonal based therapies within 4 weeks, and all other immunotherapy (tumor vaccine, cytokine, or growth factor given to control the cancer) within 2 weeks prior to the planned start of study treatment.\n* Chemotherapy within 21 days prior to the planned start of study treatment.\n* Any kinase inhibitors within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment.\n* Any PARP inhibitors within 2 weeks or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to first dose of study treatment.\n* Progression on prior immune checkpoint blockade therapy.\n* Systemic radiation therapy within 4 weeks, prior focal radiotherapy within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment.\n* Use of other investigational drugs within 2 weeks or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to study treatment administration.\n* Use of immunosuppressive medications within 4 weeks or systemic corticosteroids within 2 weeks prior to first dose of study treatment. Topical, inhaled or intranasal corticosteroids (with minimal systemic absorption) may be continued if the patient is on a stable dose.\n\nNon-absorbed intraarticular corticosteroid and replacement steroids (=< 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent) will be permitted.\n\n* Major surgery within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment. Surgery requiring local/epidural anesthesia must be completed at least 72 hours before study drug administration and patients should be recovered.\n* Known or prior malignancy requiring active treatment in the past 2 years. Exception: basal or squamous cell skin cancer or in situ cancers; or any other cancer from which the patient has been disease-free for at least 3 years.\n* Active, untreated central nervous system metastases. Patients with brain metastases identified at screening may be rescreened after the lesion(s) have been appropriately treated; patients with treated brain metastases should be neurologically stable for 4 weeks post-treatment and prior to study enrollment, and off corticosteroids for at least 2 weeks before administration of study drugs, and treated lesions should demonstrate no new growth on the re-screening scan.\n* History of (non-infectious) pneumonitis or has current pneumonitis, including grade 1 (asymptomatic; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated) pneumonitis.\n* History of severe hypersensitivity reactions to other monoclonal antibodies (mAbs).\n* Prior therapy with any anti-CD40 antibody.\n* Hypersensitivity to bevacizumab, pembrolizumab, or any of its excipients.\n* Active or prior autoimmune disease except for autoimmune thyroiditis or vitiligo.
