    "official_title": "Ablation With Confirmation of Colorectal Liver Metastases (ACCLAIM) Prospective Trial for Microwave Ablation as a Local Cure",
    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Patient must be at least 18 years old.\n2. Patient has signed a written informed consent for the MWA and participation in the study.\n3. Patient with pathologically confirmed CRC with hepatic metastases confirmed on imaging (e.g., CT or MRI).\n4. Patient has up to 3 hepatic metastases, each up to 2.5 cm in largest diameter.\n5. Patient may have up to 5 lesions in the lung (none larger than ≥ 2.0 cm) and/or any lymph node ≤2.0 cm in the largest diameter\n6. Ability to safely create an ablation zone (AZ) that completely covers the tumor with minimal margin of 5.0 mm. Subcapsular (any tumor within 10 mm from the liver capsule) or perivascular (any tumor within 10 mm from a vessel larger than 3 mm) lesions may be included. For these tumors, the calculation of the margin will not apply to the area abutting the capsule or the vessel.\n7. The target tumor(s) is/are visible by US and/or CT in a location where MWA is technically achievable and safe based on the proximity to adjacent structures. Protective maneuvers such as hydrodissection for organ mobilization are allowed and will be recorded.\n8. ECOG performance status of 0-1.\n9. Platelet count >50,000/mm3 (correctable allowed) within 30 days prior to study treatment.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Patient is unable to lie flat or has respiratory distress at rest.\n2. Patient has uncontrolled and uncorrectable coagulopathy or bleeding disorders.\n3. Patient has a history of an allergic reaction to intravenous iodine that cannot be pre-medicated or prevents performance of a CT with IV contrast.\n4. Patient has evidence of active systemic infection.\n5. Patient has a debilitating medical or psychiatric illness that would preclude giving informed consent or receiving optimal treatment or follow up.\n6. Patient is currently participating in other experimental studies that could affect the primary endpoint.\n7. Patient unable to receive general anesthesia or adequate analgesia and sedation.\n8. Tumor location less than 25 mm from hilum (see diagrams with illustration of central ducts).\n9. Patient is currently pregnant or intends to become pregnant",
