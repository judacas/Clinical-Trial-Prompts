Uncontrolled pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, or ascites requiring recurrent drainage procedures\n9. Uncontrolled hypercalcemia (≥ 1.5 mmol/L ionized calcium or Ca ≥ 12 mg/dL or corrected serum calcium ≥ ULN) or symptomatic hypercalcemia requiring continued use of bisphosphonate therapy or denosumab\n10.
