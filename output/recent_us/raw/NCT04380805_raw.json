    "official_title": "A Randomized, Double-Blind, Vehicle-Controlled, Parallel Group Phase 2 Dose-Response Study to Determine Safety and Effectiveness of Two Concentrations of NFX-179 Gel in Subjects With Cutaneous Neurofibromas",
    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Subject is at least 18 years of age\n2. Subject must provide written informed consent prior to any study procedures\n3. Subject must have a clinical diagnosis of NF1\n4. Subject has 10 clinically diagnosed Target cNFs with preferably 2 Target cNFs located on the face and 8 Target cNFs located on the anterior trunk or upper extremities. Alternatively, at least 1 Target cNF is located on the face, in which case 9 Target cNFs must be located on the anterior trunk or upper extremities. Each Target cNF must meet the following criteria:\n\n   * Has, in the investigator's opinion, a clinically typical appearance\n   * Is not within 1 cm of the orbital rim\n   * Is not covered with hair that might, in the investigator's opinion, interfere with obtaining photographs or impair evaluation of the cNF\n   * Has a Physician's Tumor Assessment grade ≥2\n   * Is dome shaped\n   * Is not pedunculated\n   * Is a discrete cNF surrounded by sufficient non-affected skin that, in the investigator's opinion:\n   * The dimensions can be measured\n   * The perimeter can be outlined in the study photographs\n   * Is not irritated (e.g., bleeding, inflamed)\n   * Is not in an area subject to repeated trauma (e.g., area that is shaved, on the beltline, under a bra strap, etc.)\n   * Does not have an active cutaneous infection\n   * Target cNFs on the face must have the following tumor dimensions:\n   * Has a length that is ≥5mm and ≤14mm\n   * Has a width that is ≥5mm and ≤14mm\n   * Has a height that is ≥2mm.\n   * Target cNFs on the anterior trunk or upper extremities must have the following tumor dimensions:\n   * Has a length that is ≥7mm and ≤14mm\n   * Has a width that is ≥5mm and ≤14mm\n   * Has a height that is ≥2mm.\n5. Subject agrees to avoid exposure of Target cNFs to excessive sunlight and to use her/his routine sunscreen if excessive exposure cannot be avoided\n6. Subject agrees NOT to use tanning beds\n7. Subject is willing to forego treatment of each Target cNF, except protocol specified therapy, during the study\n8. Female subjects who are women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test result and be willing to use a protocol approved, contraceptive method for the duration of the study\n9. Subject is willing and able to follow all study instructions and to attend all study visits.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Subject has used any of the following topical therapies within the specified period prior to Visit 1 on or in proximity to any Target cNF that, in the investigator's opinion, impairs evaluation of any the cNFs or which exposes the subject to an unacceptable risk by study participation:\n\n   * Corticosteroids; 30 days\n   * Prescription retinoids (e.g., tazarotene, tretinoin, adapalene); 30 days\n   * > 5% of an alpha-hydroxy acid (e.g., glycolic acid, lactic acid); 30 days\n   * Fluorouracil; 30 days\n   * Imiquimod; 30 days\n   * LASER, light (e.g., intense pulsed light [IPL], photo-dynamic therapy [PDT]) or other energy-based therapy; 180 days\n   * MEK inhibitor or BRAF inhibitor; ever.\n2. The subject has used any of the following systemic medications therapies within the specified period prior to Visit 1:\n\n   * Retinoids (e.g., etretinate, isotretinoin); 90 days\n   * MEK inhibitors; 180 days\n   * BRAF inhibitors; 180 days\n3. Subject has a history of hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients in the study medications\n4. Subject has any known intercurrent illness or physical condition that would, in the investigator's opinion, impair evaluation of a Target cNF or which exposes the subject to an unacceptable risk by study participation\n5. Subject has, in the investigator's opinion, clinically relevant history of liver disease, including viral hepatitis, current alcohol abuse, or cirrhosis\n6. Subject has a history of metastatic disease, or active cancer (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer, Stage I cervical cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast, or Stage 0 chronic lymphocytic lymphoma) within the previous 5 years\n7. Subject has any condition (e.g., other skin conditions or diseases, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination findings, clinical laboratory findings) or situation (e.g., vacation, scheduled surgery) that would, in the investigator's opinion, impair evaluation of a Target cNF or which exposes the subject to an unacceptable risk by study participation\n8. Subject has participated in an investigational drug trial in which administration of an investigational study medication occurred within the previous 30 days",
