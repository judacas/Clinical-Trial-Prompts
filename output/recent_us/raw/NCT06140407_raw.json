    "inclusion_criteria": "* ECOG performance status of 0-1\n* Life expectancy of >3 months according to the investigator's judgment\n* Solid tumors known for response on Il-2 or Il-10 and/or high expression of EGFR like all Non-small cell Lung, Skin, Head and Neck, Colon, Kidney, Bladder, Pancreatic cancers and all squamous cell carcinoma of other organs can be included with a classical histology report, specific EGFR expression or amplification reports are needed for other solid tumor types like gynecologic, prostate or triple negative breast cancer\n* Measurable disease, defined as at least one (non-irradiated) lesion measurable on CT/MRI or bone scan as defined by RECIST 1.1.\n* Progressive disease (PD) at study entry defined as one or more of the following criteria:\n* Clinical PD with performance decline, clinical symptoms and/or observed tumor growth\n* PD documented with imaging showing at least 20% growth (largest diameter) and/or new lesions\n* Adequate cardiovascular, hematological, liver, and renal function.\n* Subjects have failed one or more lines of systemic therapy and have not been operated on or receiving anti-cancer medication for at least 4 weeks.\n* Males and females of childbearing potential must agree to use effective contraception starting prior to the first day of treatment and continuing during treatment\n* Additional criteria may apply\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Subjects with documented diffuse peritoneal disease or persistent abundant ascites\n* Subjects with known prolonged QtC interval\n* Concomitant or recent (<4 weeks or 5 half-lives of the last treatment, whichever is shorter) treatment with agents with anti-tumor activity, including immunotherapies, or experimental therapies. Bone treatments and supportive care can be continued\n* Major surgery within 4 weeks, Radiation therapy for the treatment of metastases within less than 3 weeks (if single fraction of radiotherapy, then within 2 weeks) and radionuclide therapy for the treatment of metastases within 4 weeks prior to screening\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing and uncontrolled infection (TBC, COVID or HIV patients treated with at least two anti-retroviral drugs and control of their infection with at least 500 /mm3 CD4+ T-cells in their blood and patients cured from Hepatitis B or C (i.e negativity of PCR) and liver function compatible with eligibility criteria are allowed to participate), multiple myeloma, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, or psychiatric illness/social situations that, in the opinion of the investigator, would limit compliance with study requirement\n* Any other conditions that, in the investigator's opinion, might indicate the subject to be unsuitable for the study\n* Additional criteria may apply",
