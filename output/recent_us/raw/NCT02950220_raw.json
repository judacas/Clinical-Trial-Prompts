    "inclusion_criteria": "* Pathologically confirmed diagnosis of refractory cancer that has failed at least prior line of conventional standard of care therapy.\n* Diagnosed with any histologically confirmed malignancy whose disease is confirmed to be metastatic and/or unresectable for which standard curative or beneficial treatments are no longer effective.\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.\n* ≥ 4 weeks since any prior systemic therapy (excluding corticosteroid therapy) to treat the underlying malignancy (standard or investigational).\n* ≥ 2 weeks since prior palliative radiotherapy.\n* Complete recovery to baseline or Grade 1 NCI CTCAE v5.0 from AE of prior surgery, radiotherapy, endocrine therapy, and other therapy as applicable, with exception of grade 2 alopecia from prior chemotherapy.\n* Adequate bone marrow function:\n\n  * Neutrophils: ≥ 1.5 K/µL without colony-stimulating factor support\n  * Platelet Count: ≥ 100 K/µL\n  * Hemoglobin: ≥ 9.0 g/dL without need for hematopoietic growth factor or transfusion support\n  * No ongoing transfusion requirements\n* Adequate hepatic function:\n\n  * Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN), does not apply to patients with Gilbert's syndrome\n  * Serum albumin ≥ 3.0 g/dL\n  * ALT and AST ≤ 2.5 × ULN, unless hepatic metastases are present then < 5 x ULN\n* Adequate renal function with creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dL.\n* Coagulation: INR or aPTT ≤1.5 X ULN unless the subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy.\n* Adequate pulmonary function as assessed by pulse oximetry (>92% oxygen saturation on room air).\n* Negative pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential (i.e., all women except those who are post menopause for ≥ 1 year or who have a history of hysterectomy or surgical sterilization) and agree to use of effective contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control) during study.\n* Male participants and female participants of childbearing potential who engage in heterosexual intercourse must agree to use protocol specified method(s) of contraception\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Pregnant and/or lactating females.\n* Life expectancy of less than three months.\n* Currently being treated by \"biological therapy\" as defined by the National Cancer Institute (https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/immunotherapy/bio-therapies-fact-sheet) Examples include checkpoint inhibitors, adoptive cell transfer, monoclonal antibodies, treatment vaccines, cytokines, CAR-T therapy, and natural killer (NK) cell therapy.\n* Participants that are actively positive for COVID.\n* Autoimmune disease requiring therapy; immunodeficiency, or any disease process requiring immunosuppressive therapy, with exception to the following:\n\n  * intranasal, inhaled, topical steroids, or local steroid injection (e.g., intra-articular injection);\n  * Systemic corticosteroids at physiologic doses ≤ 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent;\n  * Steroids as premedication for hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., CT scan premedication).\n* Prior clinical trial requiring participant to receive an investigational drug within four weeks of enrollment.\n* Live vaccine within 30 days prior to enrollment.\n* Clinically significant (i.e., active) cardiovascular disease: cerebral vascular accident/stroke (< 6 months prior to enrollment), myocardial infarction (< 6 months prior to enrollment), unstable angina, congestive heart failure (≥ New York Heart Association Classification Class II), or serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication.\n* Mental or psychological illness preventing cooperation with treatment, efficacy evaluations.\n* Participants who have undergone prior organ transplantation, including allogeneic stem-cell transplantation.",
