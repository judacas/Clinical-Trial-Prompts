    "official_title": "A Phase I Study of the NovoTTF-100L(P) System to Enhance Antitumor Activity in Patients With Predominant Hepatic Metastatic Cancer",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Patients with advanced malignancies, either refractory to standard therapy or for which no effective standard therapy is available, unless the drugs in the protocol are part of the standard of care for a specific diagnosis\n\n  * Predominant hepatic metastasis is defined as at least 50% of the total tumor burden involving the liver\n  * An aberrant PI3K pathway such as PIK3CA mutations or PTEN loss, is detected in a CLIA (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments)-certified laboratory\n  * For patients who are enrolled into the arm of FOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab, they must have metastatic colorectal cancer with predominant hepatic metastases\n  * For patients who are enrolled into the arm of DAT, they must have predominant hepatic metastases harboring an aberrant PI3K pathway\n* Patients must have measurable or evaluable disease, as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1\n* Women of child-bearing potential (women who are not postmenopausal for at least one year or are not surgically sterile) and men must agree to use adequate contraception (e.g., hormonal, barrier device, or abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for 30 days after the last dose of the study agents\n* Patients must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 2\n* Neutrophils >= 1,500/uL\n* Platelets >= 100,000/uL\n* Total bilirubin =< 1.5 x ULN (upper limit of normal) (except patients with Gilbert's syndrome, who must have a total bilirubin =< 3.0 mg/dL)\n* Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) =< 3 x ULN or =< 5 x ULN if liver metastases persist\n* Serum creatinine =< 1.5 mg/dL or calculated creatinine clearance >= 50 mL/minutes\n* Patients should be able to read and fully understand the requirements of the trial, be willing to comply with all trial visits and assessments, and be willing and able to sign an Institutional Reviewed Board (IRB)-approved written informed consent document\n* Patients may receive palliative radiation therapy immediately before or during the treatment if the radiation therapy is not delivered to the sole target lesions\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection requiring intravenous antibiotics, symptomatic congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class III or IV), unstable angina pectoris, uncontrolled systemic hypertension (systolic blood pressure [BP] > 140 mm Hg, diastolic BP > 90 mm Hg), left ventricular ejection fraction < 50%, active bleeding, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements\n* Patients who have not recovered from major surgical procedure, or significant traumatic injury (i.e., patients still need additional medical care for these issues)\n* History of allergic reactions to the study drugs or their analogs, or any component of the products, or sensitive to conductive hydrogels used on electrocardiogram (ECG) stickers or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) electrodes\n* Any treatment specific for tumor control within 3 weeks of drugs; or within 2 weeks if cytotoxic agents were given weekly (within 6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C), or within 5 half-lives for targeted agents with half-lives and pharmacodynamic effects lasting fewer than 4 days (that includes, but is not limited to, erlotinib, sorafenib, sunitinib, bortezomib, and similar agents), or failure to recover from the toxic effect of any of these therapies prior to study entry\n* Symptomatic primary tumors or metastasis of brain and/or central nervous system that are uncontrolled with antiepileptics and requiring high doses of steroids\n* Implanted pacemaker, defibrillator, nerve stimulator or other active electronic medical devices\n* Corrected QT interval (QTc) is greater than 480 milliseconds (msec) at screening, or documented clinically significant arrhythmias. The QTc formula Bazett will be used for assessing subject eligibility\n* History of stroke or transient ischemic attack, peripheral vascular disease, active gastric or duodenal ulcer, abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation, or intra-abdominal abscess within 6 months prior to study enrollment\n* Patients with known human immunodeficiency virus infection, active hepatitis B or C\n* Women who are pregnant will be excluded from the study",
