Women <50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal treatments and if they have luteinizing hormone and follicle- stimulating hormone levels in the post-menopausal range for the institution or underwent surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy).\n\nWomen ≥50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments, had radiation-induced menopause with last menses >1 year ago, had chemotherapy-induced menopause with last menses >1 year ago, or underwent surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or hysterectomy).\n\nNon sterilized male patients who are sexually active with a female partner of childbearing potential must use a male condom plus spermicide from screening through 180 days after receipt of the final dose of durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy or 90 days after receipt of the final dose of durvalumab monotherapy.\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\n1. Involvement in the planning and/or conduct of the study (applies to both AstraZeneca staff and/or staff at the study site).\n2. Previous IP assignment in the present study.\n3. Concurrent enrollment in another clinical study, or another sub-study of this protocol, unless it is an observational (non-interventional) clinical study or during the follow up period of an interventional study.\n4. Participation in another clinical study with an investigational product during the last 28 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer, prior to the first dose of study treatment.\n5. Any concurrent chemotherapy, investigational agent, biologic, or hormonal therapy for cancer treatment. Concurrent use of hormonal therapy for non-cancer-related conditions (eg, hormone replacement therapy) is acceptable.\n6.

Receipt of any investigational anticancer therapy within 28 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer, prior to the first dose of study treatment.\n8. Radiotherapy treatment to more than 30% of the bone marrow or with a wide field of radiation within 4 weeks of the first dose of study drug. Note: Local treatment of isolated lesions, excluding target lesions, for palliative intent is acceptable.\n9. Major surgical procedure (as defined by the Investigator) within 28 days prior to the first dose of IP. Note: Local surgery of isolated lesions for palliative intent is acceptable.\n10. History of allogenic organ transplantation.\n11. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness, including but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, ILD, serious chronic GI conditions associated with diarrhea, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirement, substantially increase risk of incurring AEs or compromise the ability of the patient to give written informed consent\n12. History of another primary malignancy except for\n\n    * Malignancy treated with curative intent and with no known active disease ≥5 years before the first dose of investigational product (durvalumab + tremelimumab) and of low potential risk for recurrence\n    * Adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer or lentigo maligna without evidence of disease\n    * Adequately treated carcinoma in situ without evidence of disease\n13.

Patients whose brain metastases have been treated may participate provided they show radiographic stability (defined as 2 brain images, both of which are obtained after treatment to the brain metastases. These imaging scans should both be obtained at least 4 weeks apart and show no evidence of intracranial progression). In addition, any neurologic symptoms that developed either as a result of the brain metastases or their treatment must have resolved or be stable either, without the use of steroids, or are stable on a steroid dose of ≤10 mg/day of prednisone or its equivalent and anti-convulsants for at least 14 days prior to the start of treatment.

Patients with a past or resolved HBV infection (defined as the presence of hepatitis B core antibody [anti-HBc] and absence of HBsAg) are eligible. Patients positive for hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody are eligible only if polymerase chain reaction is negative for HCV RNA.\n17.

Known allergy or hypersensitivity to study drug(s) or compounds of similar biologic composition to the study drug(s), or any of the study drug excipients.\n21.
