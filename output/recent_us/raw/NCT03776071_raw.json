    "official_title": "A Phase 1a/1b Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion Study of NPX887 in Participants With Solid Tumor Malignancies Known to Express B7-H7/HHLA2",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Histologically or cytologically confirmed recurrent, metastatic solid tumor refractory to, or intolerant of, standard of care therapy in one of the following indications:\n\n  * Phase 1a (Dose Escalation): Non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), colorectal carcinoma (CRC), gastric and gastro-esophageal carcinoma, esophageal adenocarcinoma, biliary tract cancers, ovarian carcinoma, and other solid tumor types known to express B7-H7/HHLA2.\n  * Phase 1b including Part 1b (Dose Expansion) and Part 1c (Randomized Dose Comparison): participants who have clear cell RCC, EGFR mutant lung adenocarcinoma, or gastric/GEJ adenocarcinoma.\n  * In Phase 1b, participants must have confirmed B7-H7/HHLA2 expression in their tumor determined via archival tissue IHC testing through a central lab (pre-screening).\n* Phase 1a: Evaluable disease (measurable or non-measurable) by RECIST v.1.1 criteria; Phase 1b: Measurable disease by RECIST v1.1 criteria with additional disease-specific enrollment criteria applied to clear cell RCC, EGFR mutant lung adenocarcinoma, or gastric/GEJ adenocarcinoma.\n* Fresh tissue biopsies: Participants in Cohorts 2 and above in Phase 1a, the first 10 participants in each cohort of Part 1b, and the first 5 participants at each dose level in Part 1c cohort(s) will be required to have sufficient and adequate tumor tissue samples for a fresh screening biopsy and a mandatory on-treatment biopsy as clinically feasible.\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0, 1, or 2.\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document\n* Willing to use highly effective contraceptive measures throughout the trial.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Treatment with any of the following:\n\n  * Systemic anticancer treatment ≤14 days or within 5 half-lives prior to the first dose of study drug, whichever is shorter.\n  * Limited-field radiotherapy ≤7 days or extended-field thoracic radiotherapy ≤8 weeks of the first dose of study drug.\n* Have any unresolved toxicity of ≥Grade 2 from previous anti-cancer treatment, except for alopecia, chronic stable neuropathy for >4 months, changes in skin pigmentation, or requiring replacement therapy for endocrine abnormalities.\n* Participants with known brain metastases are excluded unless they are clinically stable, with no new or enlarging brain metastases as evidenced on MRI during screening.\n* History of Grade 3 immune-related pneumonitis or colitis.\n* Participants who discontinued prior immunotherapy due to immune-related toxicities, or history of unresolved prior immune-related toxicity except for endocrine abnormalities requiring replacement therapy or vitiligo.\n* Known autoimmune disease requiring immunosuppressive treatment requiring the equivalent of more than 10 mg prednisone daily.",
