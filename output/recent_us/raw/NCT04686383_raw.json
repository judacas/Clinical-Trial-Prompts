Women must refrain from donating eggs during this same period. NOTE: WOCBP is defined as any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone successful surgical sterilization or who is not postmenopausal.\n* Men with female partners of reproductive potential and pregnant partners are required to use a condom (even after vasectomy), during treatment and for at least 6 months after the final dose and must refrain from donating sperm during this same period.\n* Breastfeeding participants must be willing to discontinue breastfeeding from study enrollment through 6 months after study treatment discontinuation\n* Participants must be able to understand and be willing to sign a written informed consent document\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\n* Prior treatment for RCC with chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy, treatment with an experimental agent, and/or radiation therapy within 4 weeks or 5 halflives, whichever is shorter, prior to treatment initiation\n* More than two prior lines of systemic therapy in the metastatic setting\n* Participants who have wound dehiscence from prior surgeries\n* Active inflammatory bowel disease, chronic diarrhea, gastrointestinal malabsorption, gastrointestinal anastomosis, or any other condition that might affect the absorption of palbociclib\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to the study agents\n* Prior history of grade >=3 immune-related adverse event(s) with checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Note: participants who had endocrine toxicity of grades 3 or 4 are eligible\n* An active autoimmune disease. Note: participants with type 1 diabetes, eczema, vitiligo, alopecia, psoriasis, hypo- or hyperthyroid disease, adrenal insufficiency on systemic oral corticosteroid therapy (<= the equivalent of prednisone 10 mg/day) or other mild autoimmune disorders not requiring immunosuppressive treatment are eligible.\n* Participants receiving systemic corticosteroids at doses equivalent > 10 mg/daily of prednisone, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, sirolimus, thalidomide, or anti-tumor necrosis factor [anti-TNF] agents.
