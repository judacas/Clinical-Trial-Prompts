    "exclusion_criteria": "* 1. History of congestive heart failure (CHF), Cardiac disease, myocardial infarction within the past 6 months prior to Cycle 1 Day 1, left ventricular ejection fraction <45% by echocardiogram, unstable arrhythmia, or evidence of ischemia on electrocardiogram (ECG) within 14 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1\n\n  2.
