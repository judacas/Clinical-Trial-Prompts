    "inclusion_criteria": "* Participants will have physician permission and diagnosis COPD (FEV1 >30%-80%),\n* Gold level A-D, and\n* Ability to perform the 6 Minute Walk Test (6MWT).\n* This means that participants must meet the standard definition of COPD and have a post-bronchodilator measurement of FEV1/FVC < 0.7.\n* All COPD Assessment Test scores will be accepted.\n* Patients must have an mMRC score = 1-4.\n* Additionally, patients must have taken a Pulmonary Function Test within 1 year or they must retake (for baseline measurement) before participating in the study.\n* Patients must not have had a Pulmonary Rehabilitation class within the last 6 months.\n* If participants have had a recent cardiac event within 6 months (such as a myocardial infarction or an abnormal cardiac catheterization) they must obtain cardiologist approval before participating in the study.\n* In an effort to evaluate feasibility we will request that participants have their own Wi-Fi. Participants may use their own mobile device if they prefer but Blue Marble will have ample supply to provide to participants a device for the purposes of this study.\n* Target representativeness for gender, based on COPD demography will be ~50% women, based on recent trends indicating that women have an equal, and perhaps slightly greater risk of COPD compared to men3.\n* The Ethnicity/Race target recruitment, consistent with the US and the population at each site.\n* Participants must speak, read, and understand English at or above the 6th-grade level (as indicated by having a driver's license or self-report of completion of some high school).\n\nExclusion Criteria for participants with COPD:\n\n* Pulmonary functional fitness that precludes participation in outpatient/home PR program (i.e. requires in-patient supervision or severity of a co-morbidity that represents a contradiction to exercise in a self-directed program) will be exclusionary.\n* A participant who desaturates below SaO2 <88% during the pre-test 6MWT and does not have personal oxygen available will be referred for further evaluation and can be included once they have an O2 titration and supplemental oxygen.\n* Other exclusions include if a patient's oxygen use exceeds 4 liters per minute (LPM) or those who score less than 100 meters during the entry 6-minute walk distance.\n* Participants with coronary problems will be excluded based on specific morbidity and severity. These coronary exclusions include coronary artery disease with unstable angina.\n* Additional exclusions include: any respiratory disorder other than COPD that contraindicates participation in a home-based program.\n* The inability to learn how to use Inspiration Point\n* An acute neurological or cardiovascular condition such as stroke or acute heart surgery.\n* Active cancer with an anticipated survival of less than 6 months or treatment that will preclude them from participating in Pulmonary Rehab.\n* A participant with high fall risk as per physician determination.\n* The presence of a neurologic disorder that precludes a potential participant from following a typical COPD exercise program or demonstrating hand function sufficient to interface with the tablet.\n* This also includes patients with prior or current neurologic event/condition presenting fall risk or requiring assist device for ambulation will also be excluded.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
