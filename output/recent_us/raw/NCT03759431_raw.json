Criteria must be met without erythropoietin dependency and without packed red blood cell (pRBC) transfusion within last 2 weeks\n  * Creatinine ≤ 1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) OR measured or calculated creatinine clearance (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] can also be used in place of creatinine or creatinine clearance [CrCl]) ≥ 30 mL/min for participant with creatinine levels > 1.5 × institutional ULN (collected within 10 days prior to the start of study)\n* Creatinine clearance (CrCl) should be calculated per institutional standard\n\n  * Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × ULN OR direct bilirubin ≤ ULN for participants with total bilirubin levels > 1.5 × ULN (collected within 10 days prior to the start of study)\n  * Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)(serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT])/ alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase [SGPT]) ≤ 2.5 × ULN (≤ 5 × ULN for participants with liver metastases) (collected within 10 days prior to the start of study)\n  * International normalized ratio (INR) OR prothrombin time (PT) activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) ≤ 1.5 × ULN unless participant is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants (collected within 10 days prior to the start of study)\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti PD L2 agent or with an agent directed to another stimulatory or co-inhibitory T-cell receptor (eg, CTLA-4, OX 40, CD137)\n* Has received prior hysterectomy.
