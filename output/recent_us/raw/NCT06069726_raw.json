    "inclusion_criteria": "* Participant must be over 18 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent.\n* Diagnosis of multiple myeloma with a requirement for treatment as documented per international myeloma working group (IMWG) criteria.\n* Must have at least one aspect of measurable disease, defined as one of the following:\n* Urine M-protein excretion >=200 mg/24 hours (>=0.2 gram [g]/24 hours), or\n* Serum M-protein concentration >=0.5 grams per deciliter (g/dL) (>=5.0 gram per liter [g/L]), or\n* Serum free light chain (FLC) assay: involved FLC level >=10 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) (>=100 milligram per liter [mg/L]) and an abnormal serum free light chain ratio (<0.26 or >1.65).\n* Not a candidate for high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) due to presence of significant comorbid condition(s), such as cardiac, pulmonary or other major organ dysfunction that are likely to have a negative impact on tolerability of high dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplantation, as judged by the investigator.\n* Eastern cooperative oncology group (ECOG) status of 0-2\n* Adequate organ system functions as defined by the laboratory assessments listed as following: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >=1.5 x 10^9/L; Hemoglobin >=8.0 g/dL; Platelets >=75 x 10^9/L; Total bilirubin <=1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN); (Isolated bilirubin >1.5 x ULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin is <35%); Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) <=2.5 x ULN; eGFR >=30 mL/minute/1.73 meter^2; Urine Dipstick for protein OR Albumin/creatinine ratio (from spot urine)- Negative/trace (if >=1 plus only eligible if confirmed <=500 mg/gram (56 mg/millimoles [mmol]) by albumin/creatinine ratio (spot urine from first void); Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) by echocardiogram (ECHO) of >=35% participants with low LVEF (per institutional standards), consider referring to cardiology per local standards of care.\n* Sex and Contraception/Barrier Requirements (Female):\n* Contraceptive use by women should be consistent with local regulations regarding the methods of contraception for those participating in clinical studies. A female participant is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant or breastfeeding, and at least 1 of the following conditions applies:\n* Is NOT a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) or Due to lenalidomide being a thalidomide analogue with risk for embryofetal toxicity and prescribed under a pregnancy prevention/controlled distribution program, and bortezomib having the potential to cause fetal harm, WOCBP participants will be eligible if they commit to either: abstain continuously from heterosexual sexual intercourse as their preferred and usual lifestyle (abstinent on a long term and persistent basis) and agree to remain abstinent OR to use birth control as follows: Two methods of reliable birth control (one method that is highly effective and one additional effective (barrier) method), beginning 4 weeks prior to initiating treatment with lenalidomide, during therapy, during dose interruptions and continuing for 4 weeks following discontinuation of lenalidomide treatment. Thereafter, WOCBP participants must use one method of reliable birth control that is highly effective for a further 3 months following discontinuation of belantamab mafodotin, or a further 6 months following discontinuation of bortezomib, whichever is longer. WOCBP must also agree not to donate eggs (ova, oocytes) for the purpose of reproduction during treatment, during dose interruptions and for 28-days following the last dose of lenalidomide, 4 months following discontinuation of belantamab mafodotin treatment or 7-months following the last dose of bortezomib, whichever is longer. Two negative pregnancy tests must be obtained prior to initiating therapy. The first test should be performed within 10-14 days and the second test within 24 hours prior to prescribing the start of lenalidomide therapy.\n\nThe participant should not receive lenalidomide until the investigator has verified that the results of these pregnancy tests are negative. The investigator should evaluate the effectiveness of the contraceptive method in relationship to the first dose of study intervention. The Investigator is responsible for review of medical history, menstrual history, and recent sexual activity to decrease the risk for inclusion of a woman with an early undetected pregnancy.\n\n* Sex and Contraception/Barrier Requirements (Male):\n* Contraceptive use by men should be consistent with local regulations regarding the methods of contraception for those participating in clinical studies\n* Male participants are eligible to participate if they agree to the following from the time of first dose of study treatment until 28-days after the last dose of lenalidomide, 4-months after the last dose of bortezomib, or 6 months after the last dose of belantamab mafodotin, whichever is longer, to allow for clearance of any altered sperm: Refrain from donating sperm - Plus either: - Be abstinent from heterosexual intercourse as their preferred and usual lifestyle (abstinent on a long term and persistent basis) and agree to remain abstinent OR Must agree to use contraception/barrier as detailed below: Agree to use a male condom, even if they have undergone a successful vasectomy, and female partner to use an additional highly effective contraceptive method with a failure rate of <1% per year when having sexual intercourse with a WOCBP. Male participants should also use a condom when having sexual intercourse with pregnant females.\n* Capable of giving signed informed consent.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM).\n* Prior systemic therapy for multiple myeloma, or SMM.
