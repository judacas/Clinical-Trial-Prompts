ANC ≥1500 cells/uL\n  2. Platelet count ≥100,000/uL\n  3. Hemoglobin ≥9.0 g/dL\n* All women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test and male and female subjects must agree to use effective means of contraception (surgical sterilization or the use or barrier contraception with either a condom or diaphragm in conjunction with spermicidal gel or an IUD) with their partner from entry into the study through 6 months after the last dose\n* Availability of biological material for central review and biomarker evaluation\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Prior treatment with bevacizumab or other VEGF inhibitors or VEGF-Receptor signaling inhibitors\n* The subject is receiving warfarin (or other coumarin derivatives) and is unable to switch to low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) before the first dose of study drug.\n* The subject has evidence of acute intracranial or intratumoral hemorrhage either by MRI or computerized tomography (CT) scan. Subjects with resolving hemorrhage changes, punctate hemorrhage, or hemosiderin are eligible.\n* The subject is unable to undergo MRI scan (eg, has pacemaker).\n* The subject has received enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic agents within 14 days of study drug (eg, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone).\n* The subject has not recovered to National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 5.0 Grade ≤ 1 from AEs (except alopecia, anemia and lymphopenia) due to surgery, antineoplastic agents, investigational drugs, or other medications that were administered prior to study drug.\n* The subject is pregnant or breast-feeding.\n* The subject has serious intercurrent illness, such as:\n\n  * hypertension (two or more blood pressure [BP] readings performed at screening of > 150 mmHg systolic or > 100 mmHg diastolic) despite optimal treatment\n  * non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture\n  * significant cardiac arrhythmias\n  * untreated hypothyroidism\n  * unhealed rectal or peri-rectal abscess\n  * uncontrolled active infection\n  * symptomatic congestive heart failure or unstable angina pectoris within 3 months prior study drug any history of cardiac arrhythmia or heart block\n  * stroke or transient ischemic attack within 6 months\n* The subject has received any of the following prior anticancer therapy:\n\n  * Non-standard radiation therapy such as brachytherapy, systemic radioisotope therapy (RIT), or intra-operative radiotherapy (IORT). Note: stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is allowed\n  * Systemic therapy (including investigational agents and small-molecule kinase inhibitors) or non-cytotoxic hormonal therapy (eg, tamoxifen) within 7 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter, prior first dose of study drug\n  * Biologic agents (antibodies, immune modulators, vaccines, cytokines) within 21 days prior to first dose of study drug\n  * Nitrosoureas or mitomycin C within 42 days, or metronomic/protracted low-dose chemotherapy within 14 days, or other cytotoxic chemotherapy within 28 days, prior to first dose of study drug\n  * Prior treatment with carmustine wafers\n* Patients with radiographically apparent leptomeningeal involvement are excluded",
