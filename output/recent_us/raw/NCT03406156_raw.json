    "official_title": "A Phase I Study of the Safety, Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Properties of Intravenously Administered APG-1252 in Patients With Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) or Other Solid Tumors",
    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed small cell lung cancer (SCLC) or other solid tumors\n2. Male or non-pregnant, non-lactating female patients age ≥18 years\n3. Locally advanced or metastatic disease for which no standard therapy is judged appropriate by the investigator\n4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status < 2\n5. Adequate hematologic function as indicated by:\n\n   1. Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm˄3\n   2. Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0g/dL Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm˄3\n   3. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1000/µL\n6. Adequate renal and liver function as indicated by:\n\n   1. Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN); if serum creatinine is >1.5 X ULN, creatinine clearance must be ≥ 50 mL/min\n   2. Total bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN; If Gilbert's Syndrome may have Bilirubin> 1.5 x ULN\n   3. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤3 x ULN of institution's normal range; for patients with known liver metastases, AST and ALT may be ≤ 5 x ULN\n   4. Coagulation: activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and prothrombin time (PT)<1.2 x the upper limit of normal\n7. Brain metastases with clinically controlled neurologic symptoms, defined as surgical excision and/or radiation therapy followed by 21 days of stable neurologic function and no evidence of CNS disease progression as determined by CT or MRI within 21 days prior to the first dose of study drug\n8. Willingness to use contraception by a method that is deemed effective by the investigator by both males and female patients of child bearing potential (postmenopausal women must have been amenorrheal for at least 12 months to be considered of non-childbearing potential) and their partners throughout the treatment period and for at least three months following the last dose of study drug\n9. Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent form\n10. Willingness and ability to comply with study procedures and follow-up examination\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Receiving concurrent anti-cancer therapy (chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery, immunotherapy, hormonal therapy, targeted therapy, biologic therapy, with the exception of hormones for hypothyroidism or estrogen replacement therapy (ERT), anti estrogen analogs, agonists required to suppress serum testosterone levels); or any investigational therapy, or has had tumor embolization or tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) within 14 days prior to the first dose of study drug\n2. Steroid therapy for anti-neoplastic intent within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug\n3. Continuance of toxicities due to prior radiotherapy or chemotherapy agents that do not recover to < Grade 2\n4. Known bleeding diathesis/disorder\n5. Recent history of non-chemotherapy induced thrombocytopenia associated bleeding within 1 year prior to first dose of study drug\n6. Have active immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), active autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), or a history of being refractory to platelet transfusions (within 1 year prior to the first dose of study drug)\n7. Serious gastrointestinal bleeding within 3 months\n8. Use of therapeutic doses of anti-coagulants is excluded, along with anti-platelet agents; low-dose anticoagulation medications that are used to maintain the patency of a central intravenous catheter are permitted\n9. Received a biologic (G-CSF, GM-CSF or erythropoietin) within 28 days prior to the first dose of study drug\n10. Failure to recover adequately, as judged by the investigator, from prior surgical procedures. Patients who have had major surgery within 28 days from study entry, and patients who have had minor surgery within 14 days of study entry\n11. Unstable angina, myocardial infarction, or a coronary revascularization procedure within 180 days of study entry\n12. Neurologic instability per clinical evaluation due to tumor involvement of the central nervous system (CNS). Patients with CNS tumors that have been treated, are asymptomatic and who have discontinued steroids (for the treatment of CNS tumors) for >28 days may be enrolled\n13. Active symptomatic fungal, bacterial and/or viral infection including, but not limited to, active human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or viral hepatitis (B or C)\n14. Diagnosis of fever and neutropenia within 1 week prior to study drug administration\n15. Uncontrolled concurrent illness including, but not limited to: serious uncontrolled infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with the study requirements\n16. Prior treatment with Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibitors\n17. Any other condition or circumstance of that would, in the opinion of the investigator, make the patient unsuitable for participation in the study\n18. Known clinically active hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection. Testing for hepatitis B and C is not required for study enrollment.\n19. Known HIV infection",
