Patients with active, known, diagnosed or suspected autoimmune disease. Patients suffering from vitiligo, type I diabetes mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune thyroiditis only requiring thyroid hormone replacement therapy, or psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment can be enrolled.\n21.
