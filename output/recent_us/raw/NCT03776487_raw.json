    "official_title": "A Phase 0 Multicenter Study of the Pharmacodynamic Effects of Intratumoral Microdose Administration of Rilvegostomig, Volrustomig, Sabestomig, and AZD9592",
    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Ability and willingness to provide written informed consent. Voluntary written consent must be given before performance of any study related procedure not part of standard medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn by the patient at any time without prejudice to future medical care.\n2. Male or female â‰¥ 18 years of age at Visit 1 (Screening).\n3. Pathologic diagnosis of Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) of the oropharynx, hypopharynx, oral cavity, or larynx.\n4. Ability and willingness to comply with the study's visits and assessment schedule.\n5. At least one lesion (primary tumor, recurrent tumor, metastasis, or metastatic lymph node) that is surface accessible for CIVO injection that contains viable minimum tumor tissue volume and characteristics (e.g., based on clinical evaluation, available pre-operative imaging, pre-injection ultrasound imaging, or pathology reports indicating lesion with appropriate viable tumor volume without excessive cysts or necrosis) and for which there is a planned surgical intervention. The patient's presentation, surgical and pathology plan may determine whether a lesion is eligible with respect to a given CIVO MID needle configuration.\n6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2.\n7. Female patients who:\n\n   * Are postmenopausal for at least one year before the screening visit, OR\n   * Are surgically sterile, OR\n   * Are of childbearing potential who agree to practice a highly effective method of contraception from the time of signing the Informed Consent Form (ICF) until 7 months after the CIVO injection OR agree to completely abstain from heterosexual intercourse.\n   * Agree to refrain from donating, or retrieving for their own use, ova until 7 months after the CIVO injection.\n   * Agree to refrain from breastfeeding until 7 months after the CIVO injection.\n8. Male patients, even if surgically sterile (i.e., status post-vasectomy), who:\n\n   * Agree to practice effective barrier contraception from the time of signing the ICF until 7 months after the CIVO injection OR agree to completely abstain from heterosexual intercourse.\n   * Agree to refrain from fathering a child or donating sperm until 7 months after the CIVO injection.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Tumors and/or effaced nodes that are anticipated by the Investigator to lack a sufficient volume of viable tumor tissue (Based on available pre-operative imaging, pre-injection ultrasound imaging, or pathology reports) for CIVO microdose injection due to necrosis, cysts, excessive stroma, fibrosis, or treatment-induced tissue changes.\n2. Tumors near or involving critical structures for which, in the opinion of the treating clinician, injection would pose undue risk to the patient.\n3. Prior exposure to immune-mediated therapy including, but not limited to, other anti-CTLA-4, anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, and anti-PD-L2 antibodies within the last 5 years.\n4. Previous treatment with another ADC containing a chemotherapeutic agent that inhibits topoisomerase 1 activity or with another epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and/or mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (c-MET) targeted ADC.\n5. Patients with concurrent cancer, immune disease or active infection requiring systemic or radiotherapy.\n6. Female patients who:\n\n   * Intend to become pregnant during the study,\n   * Are both lactating and breastfeeding, OR\n   * Have a positive beta-subunit human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) pregnancy test at screening verified by the Investigator.\n7. Any uncontrolled intercurrent illness, condition, serious medical or psychiatric illness, or circumstance that, in the opinion of the Investigator, could interfere with adherence to the study's procedures or requirements, or otherwise compromise the study's objectives.\n8. History of organ transplant.\n9. Major surgery within 4 weeks prior to injection: subject must have adequate wound healing and have recovered from any prior surgery.",
