    "inclusion_criteria": "* Have a histological diagnosis of advanced STS (by local pathology review), for which treatment with doxorubicin, ifosfamide and mesna is deemed appropriate by the investigator.\n* Have measurable or nonmeasurable but evaluable disease as defined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1).\n* Have adequate hematologic, organ and coagulation function within 2 weeks (14 days) prior to enrollment.\n* Have a performance status of 0 to 1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group scale.\n* Have received no prior lines of systemic therapy and are suitable to receive doxorubicin, ifosfamide and mesna. All previous anticancer treatments must have completed ≥3 weeks (21 days) prior to the first dose of study treatment.\n* Have left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥50% assessed within 28 days prior to enrollment.\n* Have resolution of Adverse Events (AEs), with the exception of alopecia, and of all clinically significant toxic effects of prior locoregional therapy, surgery or radiotherapy to ≤Grade 1, by National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) Version 4.0.\n* Have sufficient available material from archived formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue for biomarker-related studies. If such tissue is not available, a newly obtained core or excisional biopsy of a tumor lesion must be performed.\n* If male, must be sterile or agree to use an effective method of contraception or a highly effective method of contraception during the study and for at least 12 weeks following the last dose of study treatment.\n* If female and of child-bearing potential, must:\n\n  1. have a negative serum pregnancy test at the time of enrollment,\n  2. have a negative urine pregnancy test within 24 hours prior to the first dose of study treatment, and\n  3. agree to use a highly effective method of contraception during the study and for 3 months following the last dose of study treatment.\n* Have a life expectancy of at least 3 months, in the opinion of the investigator.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Are currently enrolled in a clinical trial involving an investigational product or any other type of medical research judged not to be scientifically or medically compatible with this study.\n* Have participated within the past 30 days in a clinical trial involving an investigational product. If the previous investigational product has a long half-life, 3 months or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) should have passed.\n* Have previously completed or withdrawn from any study investigating olaratumab.\n* Have received prior treatment with olaratumab, doxorubicin, or ifosfamide, or have participated in other trials investigating olaratumab.\n* Have received prior radiotherapy of the mediastinal/pericardial area or whole pelvis radiation.\n* Have known urinary outflow obstruction, or inflammation of the urinary bladder (cystitis).\n* Are diagnosed with gastrointestinal stromal tumor or Kaposi sarcoma.\n* Have active central nervous system (CNS) or leptomeningeal metastasis (brain metastasis) at the time of enrollment. Participants with a history of CNS metastasis (previously treated with curative intent [for example, stereotactic radiation or surgery]) that has not progressed on follow-up imaging, have been asymptomatic for at least 60 days, and are not receiving systemic corticosteroids and/or anticonvulsants are eligible. Participants with signs or symptoms of neurological compromise should have appropriate radiographic imaging performed before enrollment to rule out brain metastasis.\n* Have a history of another primary malignancy, with the exception of:\n\n  1. curatively treated non-melanomatous skin cancer\n  2. curatively treated cervical carcinoma in situ\n* Have an active fungal, bacterial and/or known viral infection including human immunodeficiency virus or viral (A, B, or C) hepatitis (screening is not required).\n* Have Grade 3 or 4 peripheral neuropathy per NCI-CTCAE Version 4.0.\n* Have a serious cardiac condition.\n* Have a resting heart rate of >100 beats per minute (bpm).\n* Have a Fridericia's QT corrected interval (QTcF) interval of >450 milliseconds (msec) for males and >470 msec for females on screening electrocardiogram (ECG) utilizing Fridericia's correction.\n* Have uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, an ongoing/active infection requiring parenteral antibiotics.\n* Have a psychiatric illness/social situation that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* Have electively planned or will require major surgery during the course of the study.\n* Are females who are pregnant or breastfeeding.",
