For this reason, women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception prior to study entry, for the duration of study treatment, for 3 months following the final dose of mosunetuzumab, for 9 months after the final dose of polatuzumab vedotin, and for 3 months after the final dose of tocilizumab, as applicable. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she must inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study treatment, for 6 months after the final dose of polatuzumab vedotin, and for 2 months after the final dose of tocilizumab, as applicable.\n* Ability to understand and willingness to sign an IRB approved written informed consent document (or that of legally authorized representative, if applicable).\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Prior history of aggressive B cell lymphoma such as diffuse large B cell lymphoma or high-grade B cell lymphoma.\n* Known history of treatment-emergent immune-related

corticosteroids, mineralocorticoids for management of orthostatic hypotension, and single dose dexamethasone for nausea or B symptoms is permitted.\n* History of solid organ transplantation.\n* History of allogeneic stem cell transplantation.\n* Prior treatment with chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy within 30 days before Day 1 of Cycle 1.\n* History of severe allergic or anaphylactic

including mannitol.\n* History of erythema multiforme, Grade ≥ 3 rash, or blistering following prior treatment with immunomodulatory derivatives.\n* Known active bacterial, viral, fungal, or other infection, or any major episode of infection requiring treatment with IV antibiotics within 1 week of Day 1 of Cycle 1.\n* Known or suspected chronic active Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection.\n* Current Grade > 1 peripheral neuropathy by clinical examination or demyelinating form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.\n* Active hepatitis B infection.\n\n  * Patients who are hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) negative and hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) positive, must be negative for hepatitis B virus (HBV) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to be eligible for study participation\n* Active hepatitis C infection.\n\n  * Patients who are positive for hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody must be negative for HCV by PCR to be eligible for study participation\n* Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive status.\n* History of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML).\n* Administration of a live, attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks before first dose of study treatment or anticipation that such a live attenuated vaccine will be required during the study.\n\n  * Patients must not receive live, attenuated vaccines (e.g., FluMist®) while receiving study treatment or after the last dose until B cell recovery to the normal ranges.\n* Other malignancy that could affect compliance with the protocol or interpretation of results, with the exception of the

cancer\n  * Stage I melanoma, low grade, early stage localized prostate cancer, or any other previously treated malignancy that has been in remission without treatment for at least 2 years prior to
