Women will be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrhoeic for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. The following age-specific requirements apply:\n\n  * Women <50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrhoeic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal treatments and if they have luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone levels in the post-menopausal range for the institution or underwent surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy).\n  * Women ≥50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrhoeic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments, had radiation-induced menopause with last menses >1 year ago, had chemotherapy-induced menopause with last menses >1 year ago, or underwent surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or hysterectomy).\n* Patient is willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study including undergoing treatment and scheduled visits and examinations including follow up.\n* Must have a life expectancy of at least 6 months\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",

The following are exceptions to this criterion:\n\n    i. Intranasal, inhaled, topical steroids, or local steroid injections (e.g., intra articular injection) ii. Systemic corticosteroids at physiologic doses not to exceed 10 mg/day of prednisone or its equivalent for less than 30 days. iii. Steroids as premedication for hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., CT scan premedication) iv. Systemic glucocorticoid replacement for conditions such as adrenal or pituitary insufficiency.\n* Major surgical procedure (e.g. intra-cranial, intra-thoracic, intra-abdominal, or intra-pelvic) within 28 days prior to the first dose of canakinumab\n* Prior history of malignant disease, other than this NSCLC, that has been diagnosed and/or required therapy within the past 3 years.

Note that some contraception methods are not considered highly effective (e.g. female cap, diaphragm, or sponge with or without spermicide; non-copper containing intrauterine device; progestogen-only oral hormonal contraceptive pills where inhibition of ovulation is not the primary mode of action [excluding Cerazette/desogestrel which is considered highly effective]; and triphasic combined oral contraceptive pills).\n* Connective tissue disorders involving the lung(s) and/or esophagus requiring active treatment or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis\n* Known history of active primary immunodeficiency\n* Known allergy or hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs or any of the study drug excipients.\n* Receipt of live vaccination within 3 months prior to the first dose of study durg.
