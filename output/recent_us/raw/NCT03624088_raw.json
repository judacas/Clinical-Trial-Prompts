    "official_title": "Early Detection, Accurate Staging, and Biologic Characterization of HCC with Hybrid 68Ga-PSMA-Dual -Contrast PET/MRI and PET/CT Using Cyclotron-Produced 68Ga",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Patients with either an imaging diagnosis of Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by Computed Tomography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance Imaging MRI (Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System [LI-RADS] 5) confirmed by a board-certified abdominal radiologist, or with biopsy-proven HCC\n* Subjects who may undergo hepatic surgical resection, liver transplant, or hepatic locoregional therapy (LRT) (e.g., ablation, embolization, etc.)\n* No prior treatment for index HCC lesion (surgical resection, liver transplant, hepatic locoregional therapy arm). Patients that have been previously treated with HCC, but have new or reoccurring untreated lesions, are included in the study.\n* Male or female with age greater than 18 years, with the capacity and willingness to provide written informed consent.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Patients requiring emergent surgery for a ruptured/bleeding HCC\n* Bilirubin > 3.0 mg/dL, which is a contraindication for Gadoxetate, the MRI contrast agent (relevant to positron emission tomography [PET]/MRI)\n* Patients with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 30 ml/min/1.73m^2, on dialysis, or with acute kidney injury\n* Pregnant and/or breast-feeding patients. A negative pregnancy test within 48 hours of the PET scan\n* Patients with higher than the weight/size limitations of PET/MRI or PET/CT scanner\n* Subjects with history of allergic response to Eovist or Gadavist\n* Subjects with known history of claustrophobia\n* Subjects with GFR < 30 ml/min/1.73m^2, on dialysis, or with acute kidney injury\n* Subjects with a history of severe hypersensitivity to Eovist or Gadavist\n* Patients with contraindication to MRI (relevant to PET/MRI):\n\n  * Patients who have a heart pacemaker\n  * Patients who have a metallic foreign body (metal sliver) in their eye, or who have an aneurysm clip in their brain\n  * Patients who have implanted devices with magnets\n  * Patients who have other implanted electronic devices\n  * Patients who have deep brain stimulator\n  * Patients who have vagal nerve stimulator\n  * Patients with cochlear (ear) or auditory implants\n\nPSMA PET/CT will be an alternative in this study for patients who are unable to undergo PET/MRI for any reason but are otherwise eligible for the study.",
