    "inclusion_criteria": "* Histologic confirmation of adenocarcinoma of the prostate without small cell features\n* Current evidence of metastatic disease documented by either bone lesions on radionuclide bone scan and/or soft tissue lesions on computerized tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (CT/MRI)\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1\n* Ongoing androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue or bilateral orchiectomy\n* Documented prostate cancer progression per Prostate Cancer Working Group (PCWG3) criteria within 6 months prior to screening\n* Chemotherapy-naÃ¯ve for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), with 1 to 2 prior second generation hormonal therapies in the recurrent non-metastatic setting and/or metastatic setting, and no more than 1 second generation hormonal therapy in the mCRPC setting. Must have progressed during or after second generation hormonal therapy or have documented intolerance to second generation hormonal therapy\n* Participants must meet one of the following criteria regarding tissue submission: Sufficient tumor samples from a newly obtained (\"fresh\") biopsy (obtained during screening); or archival tumor tissue in the form of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) block or unstained tumor tissue slides. For participants with bone-only disease or inaccessible soft tissue lesions or if the biopsy procedure would pose an unacceptable clinical risk for the participant, submission of tumor tissue obtained from a fresh biopsy is not required.\n* Men must agree to follow specific methods of contraception, if applicable\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be MALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Active brain metastases\n* Active, known, or suspected autoimmune disease\n* Condition requiring systemic treatment with corticosteroids (> 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of start of study treatment.
