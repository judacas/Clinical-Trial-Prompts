    "inclusion_criteria": "* Written informed consent\n* Cytologically or histologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic solid tumor that has progressed on standard therapy or for which no standard therapy exist; or be intolerant of standard therapy\n* Have not received an experimental drug within 4 weeks or 5 half-lives (whichever is shorter) of study drug treatment or already be enrolled in a clinical study\n* ECOG performance status 0-1\n* Laboratory and ECG assessments within 28 days of enrollment including acceptable cardiac, renal, and hepatic functions\n* Agree to baseline core needle biopsy or archival (within 12 months of screening) tumor submission; Note: Participants whose only site(s) of disease are in areas considered moderate or high risk for biopsy complications may be enrolled without a fresh biopsy upon Sponsor approval.\n* Non pregnant participants; female participants of child bearing potential with non-sterile partners agree to use an effective form of contraception from the time of first dose of study drug (or 14 days prior to first dose for oral contraception) until 7 months after the last dose of study drug. Effective forms of contraception include hormonal (injection or oral), double barrier method, or intrauterine device. Non-sterile male participants with sexual partners of childbearing potential agree to use a barrier contraception method and agree to not donate sperm from the time of first dose of study drug until 4 months after the last dose of study drug.\n* Measurable disease according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v)1.1\n\nPhase 1 Expansion Cohorts Specific Inclusion Criteria (in addition to above inclusion criteria):\n\n* NSCLC: Participants must have locally advanced/unresectable or metastatic NSCLC. Participants must have received ≤2 prior lines of therapy in the advanced/metastatic setting.\n* TNBC: Participants must have locally advanced unresectable, recurrent, or metastatic TNBC. Participants must have received ≤2 prior lines of therapy in the advanced/metastatic setting. TNBC participants with germline BRCA1/2 mutations must have received ≤3 prior lines of therapy in the advanced/metastatic setting.\n* Ovarian Cancer: Participants must have locally advanced unresectable, recurrent, or metastatic ovarian cancer. Participants must have received ≤2 prior lines of therapy in the advanced/metastatic setting with or without maintenance treatment.\n* Tumors with AKT3 mutation/amplification: Participants must have a locally advanced unresectable, recurrent, or metastatic solid malignancy. Participants with known AKT3 mutation/amplification based on next generation sequencing (NGS) performed per local standard of care.\n\nPhase 2 Specific Inclusion Criteria (in addition to above inclusion criteria):\n\n* Have confirmed unresectable Stage III or metastatic Stage IV cutaneous melanoma that has radiographically progressed (as confirmed by imaging assessed by the Investigator) on an approved first-line single-agent or combination anti-PD-1 therapy\n* Receiving anti-PD-1 therapy as their first line of treatment at the time of enrollment and amenable to continuing anti-PD-1 therapy during the study\n\nKey\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Ongoing >Grade 1 toxicity from prior therapy according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v5.0 (Note: Grade 2 alopecia and Grade 2 sensory neuropathy are not exclusionary)\n* Has melanoma with documented BRAF mutation (Phase 2 only)\n* Has known leptomeningeal disease, spinal cord compression, or brain metastases, except participants with the following:\n\n  * Brain metastases that have been treated and are clinically stable for at least 4 weeks prior to the first administration of study drug; Note: Participants receiving steroids for brain metastases must be either off steroids or on a stable, or decreasing dose, of <10 mg daily of prednisone (or equivalent) in order to be eligible for enrollment; and\n  * No ongoing neurological symptoms related to the anatomic location of the brain metastases.\n\nNote: Neurological symptoms that are considered sequelae to treatment for brain metastases are allowed.\n\n* Has known structural cardiac disease\n* Has known serious arrythmia, serious dysrhythmia, history of long QT syndrome, or clinically relevant cardiac conduction abnormalities\n* Has an active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (ie, with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (eg, thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency) is not considered a form of systemic treatment and is allowed.\n* At time of screening, is receiving systemic steroid therapy (greater than or equal to 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent) or is taking any immunosuppressive therapy; Note: Use of topical, inhaled, nasal, or ophthalmic steroids is allowed.\n* Has active and clinically significant bacterial, fungal, or viral infection, including known hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\n* Has a history of, or currently has, an acquired or primary (congenital) immunodeficiency;\n* Has had prior anti-cancer treatment with chemotherapeutic agents or immune modulating agents within <4 weeks or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter, prior to the first dose of study drug.\n* Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of first dose of study drug;\n* Has had or has planned major surgery within 2 weeks of the first dose of study drug;\n* Inability to swallow an oral dose of a medication (eg, oral capsules)\n* Is taking medications that are considered strong inducers or inhibitors of CYP2C8 or CYP3A4/5, P-glycoprotein (P-gp), breast cancer resistant protein (BCRP), or sensitive substrates of P-gp and BCRP (Appendix C) that cannot be discontinued at least 1 week prior to first dose of study drug and for the duration of the study.\n* Is taking drugs that modify gastric pH, such as proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) or H2 blockers.
