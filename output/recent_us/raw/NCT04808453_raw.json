    "official_title": "Multi-center, Randomized, Placebo Controlled, Interventional Phase 2A Clinical Trial Evaluating the Safety and Potential Efficacy of Multiple Dosing of Mesenchymal Stromal Cells in Patients With Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2)",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Age 18-80 years\n* Meets 'Berlin Criteria' for diagnosis of moderate to severe ARDS for a minimum of 4 hours\n* Less than 48 hours on a ventilator after meeting criteria for diagnosis of ARDS\n* SARS-CoV-2 (proven by RT-PCR assay) with radiographic infiltrates\n* PaO2/FiO2 < 250\n* Positive end-expiratory airway pressure (PEEP) >5 cm H20\n* Elevated C-reactive protein (above laboratory upper limit of normal)\n* Meets organ function requirements, including left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) >35% ( as defined below)\n* Off other investigational agents directed against inflammatory cytokines 48 hours prior to enrollment; agents directed against the replication of SARS-CoV-2 [e.g., Remdesivir] are permitted\n* Voluntary informed consent in person or virtually by the patient or patient surrogate considering the face to face limitations during the COVID-19 pandemic and, given the nature of the study population, which frequently requires mechanical ventilation with sedation, surrogate consent will likely occur in a substantial proportion of the study population (this will remain a valid consent until the patient is fully alert, and aware, and can provide a second consent to continue participation in the study).\n* Adequate organ function is defined as:\n\n  * Renal: Calculated estimated glomerular filtration rate >30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (on chemistry panel)\n  * Hepatic: Bilirubin <3x upper limit of normal (ULN) and AST, ALT and alkaline phosphatase <5x ULN\n  * Cardiac: Absence of uncontrolled arrhythmia and LVEF >35%\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 80 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Ventilator support of FiO2 >0·8 or PEEP >20 cm H2O and ongoing use of more than two vasopressors for 2 or more hours with any agent at doses shown below in the supine position.\n\n  * Norepinephrine >12 μg/min or 0.2 μg/kg per min\n  * Phenylephrine >150 μg/min or 3 μg/kg per min\n  * Epinephrine >10 ug/min or 0.2 μg/kg per min\n  * Vasopressin >0.04 units/min\n* Concurrent use of other investigational agents specifically for treatment of ARDS or inflammatory cytokines. (Note: Agents established to be efficacious and/or those used outside of formal trials are permitted as supportive data emerge)\n* Known ineligibility for use of a ventilator for a minimum of 7 days, as judged by the institution's Triage Team\n* Known allergy to MSC components: fetal calf serum, human albumin or DMSO\n* Active invasive malignant disease requiring chemotherapy/radiation\n* Other concurrent life-threatening disease (life expectancy <6 months) or eligible for hospice care\n* Known history of HIV infection on active treatment\n* Females who are pregnant or breastfeeding\n* Current mean arterial pressure (MAP) <60 mmHg while on 2 or more vasopressors at above doses for more than 2 hours\n* History of any significant cardiac (myocardial infarction within 12 months of screening visit or unstable angina), chronic ongoing hepatic, or renal disease (grade 3 or higher); diagnosis of congestive heart failure with hypoxemia primarily due to decompensated heart failure; diagnosis of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or interstitial lung disease requiring supplemental oxygen at home\n* Concurrent diagnosis of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage\n* Requiring continuous dialysis (unable to stop dialysis during study agent infusion)",
