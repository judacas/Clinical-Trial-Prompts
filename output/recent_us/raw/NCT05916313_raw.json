Cohort 1 (n=16): measurable disease is not required for this cohort. i. Agnostic to tumor type. b. Cohort 2 (n=40): Metastatic disease present on conventional imaging defined as having RECIST 1.1 measurable disease or multiple bone metastases.\n\n   i.

Patients can be imaged at initial staging with what is judged by the treating physician to be high risk disease and where the presence of metastatic disease would greatly impact treatment planning and prognosis. Patients may also be imaged after definitive therapy (surgery, chemotherapy or radiation therapy) if in the determination of the treating physician or investigator there is a high risk of disease recurrence that would also impact treatment plan and/or prognosis.\n\n   ii. Pathologically confirmed head and neck cancer or bladder cancer.\n3.
