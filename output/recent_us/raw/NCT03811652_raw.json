    "inclusion_criteria": "* REGISTRATION ELIGIBILITY: Patients must have a history of pathologically confirmed locally advanced/unresectable Merkel cell carcinoma or metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma\n* REGISTRATION ELIGIBILITY: Patients must have evaluable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v)1.1\n* REGISTRATION ELIGIBILITY: Patients must have had prior treatment with anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L-1 antibody (e.g., pembrolizumab, avelumab, etc.) and have experienced progressive disease during treatment or within 120 days from the last dose of anti-PD-(L)1 therapy. Anti-PD-(L)1 therapy administered in combination with other agent(s) including ipilimumab is also allowed as prior therapy, if patients experienced progressive disease during treatment or within 120 days from the last dose of anti-PD-(L)1 therapy. If participants are receiving or received cytotoxic chemotherapy as most recent therapy prior to screening for this trial, there must be clinically and/or radiologically documented progressive disease on or after chemotherapy prior to being eligible for this study. If the patient is receiving bridging chemotherapy, the most recent administration must be ≥ 14 days prior to planned cycle 1 day 1 (C1D1) of the clinical trial to be eligible\n* REGISTRATION ELIGIBILITY: Age >= 18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of M1774/tuvusertib in combination with avelumab in patients < 18 years of age, children are excluded from this study\n* REGISTRATION ELIGIBILITY: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =< 2 (Karnofsky >= 60%)\n* REGISTRATION ELIGIBILITY: Absolute neutrophil count >= 1,000/mcL\n* REGISTRATION ELIGIBILITY: Platelets >= 100,000/mcL\n* REGISTRATION ELIGIBILITY: Total bilirubin =< institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) or ≤ 1.5 x ULN for subjects with Gilbert's disease\n* REGISTRATION ELIGIBILITY: Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)(serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT]) =< 3 x institutional ULN\n* REGISTRATION ELIGIBILITY: Creatinine =< institutional ULN\n* REGISTRATION ELIGIBILITY: Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) >= 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2\n* REGISTRATION ELIGIBILITY: Hemoglobin >= 9.0 g/dL\n* REGISTRATION ELIGIBILITY: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients on effective anti-retroviral therapy with undetectable viral load within 6 months are eligible for this trial\n* REGISTRATION ELIGIBILITY: For patients with evidence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, the HBV viral load must be undetectable on suppressive therapy, if indicated\n* REGISTRATION ELIGIBILITY: Patients with a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection must have been treated and cured.
