    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Patients with known central nervous system involvement.\n2. Patients who require the use of strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP enzymes or transporters (e.g., CYP3A4, 2D6, 2C19) or (P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1. OAT3, OCT2, MATE1 and MATE2-K). Patients who are receiving these medications at Screening can be enrolled into the trial if they discontinue them for at least 14 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer, before they commence PTX-100.

Patients with a history of hepatitis C virus infection who have completed curative antiviral treatment and have a viral load below the limit of quantification may be eligible and should be discussed with the Medical Monitor.\n\n9.
