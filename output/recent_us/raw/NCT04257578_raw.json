    "inclusion_criteria": "* Female participants with histologically-confirmed diagnosis of HGS ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer.\n* Platinum-resistant disease, defined as:\n* For participants who had only 1 line of platinum-based therapy: progression between > 1 month and ≤ 6 months after the last dose of platinum-based therapy of at least 4 cycles.\n* For participants who had 2 or 3 lines of platinum-based therapy: progression ≤ 6 months after the last dose of platinum-based therapy.\n* Participants have received at least 1 but no more than 3 prior lines of systemic therapy and for whom single-agent therapy is appropriate as the next line of therapy. Participants may have been treated with up to 1 line of therapy subsequent to determination of platinum-resistance.\n* Disease progression per RECIST v1.1 (by investigator assessment) of at least 1 measurable lesion on or after the most recent therapy.\n* Either formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue (up to 5 years old) or newly-obtained biopsies must be available for FRα assessment prior to randomization.\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) of 0 or 1.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be FEMALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
