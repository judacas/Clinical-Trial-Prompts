It is strongly recommended that MPAL be evaluated using multidimensional flow cytometry and/or (KMT2Ar) qt PCR. It is strongly recommended that MPAL be evaluated using multidimensional flow cytometry and/or (KMT2Ar) qt PCR\n* DONOR ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n* Matched Unrelated Donors:\n\nUnrelated donor candidates must be matched at high resolution at a minimum of 8/8 alleles (HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1). One-antigen HLA mismatches are not permitted. HLA matching of additional alleles is recommended according to National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) guidelines, but will be at the discretion of local centers\n\n* Haploidentical Matched Family Members:\n\n  * Minimum match level full haploidentical (at least 5/10; HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, -DQB1 alleles). The following issues (in no particular order) should be considered in choosing a haploidentical donor:\n\n    * Absent or low patient donor-specific antibodies (DSA)\n\n      * Mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of any anti-donor HLA antibody by solid phase immunoassay should be < 2000. Donors with higher levels are not eligible.\n\n        * If a screening assay against pooled HLA antigens is used, positive results must be followed with specificity testing using a single antigen assay. The MFI must be < 2000 unless the laboratory has validated higher threshold values for reactivity for HLA antigens (such as HLA-C, -DQ, and -DP), that may be enhanced in concentration on the single antigen assays. Donor anti- recipient antibodies are of unknown clinical significance and do not need to be sent or reported.\n        * Consult with Study Chair for the clinical significance of any recipient anti-donor HLA antibody.\n        * If centers are unable to perform this type of testing, please contact the Study Chair to make arrangements for testing.\n    * If killer immunoglobulin testing (KIR) is performed: KIR status by mismatch, KIR-B, or KIR content criteria can be used according to institutional guidelines.\n    * ABO compatibility (in order of priority):\n\n      * Compatible or minor ABO incompatibility\n      * Major ABO incompatibility\n    * CMV serostatus:\n\n      * For a CMV seronegative recipient: the priority is to use a CMV seronegative donor when feasible\n      * For a CMV seropositive recipient: the priority is to use a CMV seropositive donor when feasible\n    * Age: younger donors including siblings/half-siblings, and second degree relatives (aunts, uncles, cousins) are recommended, even if < 18 years\n* Size and vascular access appropriate by center standard for peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) collection if needed\n* Haploidentical matched family members: screened by center health screens and found to be eligible\n* Unrelated donors: meet eligibility criteria as defined by the NMDP or other unrelated donor registries. If the donor does not meet the registry eligibility criteria but an acceptable eligibility waiver is completed and signed per registry guidelines, the donor will be considered eligible for this study\n* Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) negative\n* Not pregnant\n* MUD donors and post-transplant cyclophosphamide haplo donors should be asked to provide BM. If donors refuse and other donors are not available, PBSC is allowed. TCR-alpha beta/CD19 depleted haplo donors must agree to donate PBSC\n* Must give informed consent:\n\n  * Haploidentical matched family members: Institution standard of care donor consent and Protocol-specific Donor Consent for Optional Studies\n  * Unrelated donors: standard NMDP Unrelated Donor Consent\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 6 Months\nMust have maximum age of 21 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* PATIENT EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR ENROLLMENT:\n* Patients with genetic disorders (generally marrow failure syndromes) prone to secondary AML/ALL/MPAL with known poor outcomes because of sensitivity to alkylator therapy and/or TBI are not eligible (Fanconi Anemia, Kostmann Syndrome, Dyskeratosis Congenita, etc). Patients with Downs syndrome because of increased toxicity with intensive conditioning regimens.\n* Patients with any obvious contraindication to myeloablative HCT at the time of enrollment\n* Female patients who are pregnant are ineligible as many of the medications used in this protocol could be harmful to unborn children and infants\n* Sexually active patients of reproductive potential who have not agreed to use an effective contraceptive method for the duration of their study participation\n* PATIENT EXCLUSION CRITERIA TO PROCEED TO HCT:\n* Patients with uncontrolled fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections are excluded. Patients with history of fungal disease during chemotherapy may proceed if they have a significant response to antifungal therapy with no or minimal evidence of disease remaining by computed tomography (CT) evaluation\n* Patients with active central nervous system (CNS) leukemia or any other active site of extramedullary disease at the time of initiation of the conditioning regimen are not permitted.\n\n  * Note: Those with prior history of CNS or extramedullary disease, but with no active disease at the time of pre-transplant workup, are eligible\n* Pregnant or breastfeeding females are ineligible as many of the medications used in this protocol could be harmful to unborn children and infants",
