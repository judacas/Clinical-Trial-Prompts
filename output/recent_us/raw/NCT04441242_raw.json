    "inclusion_criteria": "* Greater than or equal to 18 years of age and less than or equal to age 73.\n* Able to understand and sign the Informed Consent Document.\n* Clinical performance status of Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 0-2\n* Room air oxygen saturation of 92% or greater\n* Male patients and must be willing to practice birth control from the time of enrollment on this study and for four months following the final CAR T-cell infusion. Pre-menopausal patients (female patients who have had a menstrual period within the last year) must be willing to practice birth control from the time of enrollment and for one year following the final CAR T cell infusion.\n* Seronegative for HIV antibody. (The experimental treatment being evaluated in this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who are HIV seropositive can have decreased immune -competence and thus are less responsive to the experimental treatment and more susceptible to its toxicities.)\n* Seronegative for Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1).\n* Negative for hepatitis B surface antigen. Positive hepatitis B tests can be further evaluated by confirmatory tests; and if confirmatory tests are negative, the patient can be enrolled.\n* Seronegative for hepatitis C antibody unless antigen negative. If hepatitis C antibody test is positive, then patients must be tested for the presence of ribonucleic acid (RNA) by Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and be Hepatitis C (HCV) RNA negative to be enrolled.\n* A patient with a prior history of hepatitis B or a prior history of hepatitis C may participate, as long as the patient s viral hepatitis has been treated, and the patient has no detectable Hepatitis B (HBV) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or HCV RNA.\n* At time of protocol enrollment, the patient should be negative for cytomegalovirus (CMV) by antibody testing or by PCR. In case of disagreement between these 2 CMV tests, the tests will be repeated, and Dept. of Laboratory Medicine consulted.\n* Absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1000/mm^3 without the support of filgrastim or other growth factors.\n* Platelet count greater than or equal to 55,000/mm^3\n* Hemoglobin greater than 8.0 g/dl. Transfusion support is allowed.\n* Less than 5% malignant cells in the peripheral blood leukocytes\n* Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) less or equal to 3 times the upper limit of the institutional normal unless liver involvement by malignancy is demonstrated.\n* Serum creatinine less than or equal to 1.6 mg/dL.\n* Total bilirubin less than or equal to 2.0 mg/dl.\n* At least 14 days must have elapsed since any prior systemic therapy prior to apheresis and prior to the initiation of chemotherapy (including systemic corticosteroids at doses greater than prednisone 5 mg/day or the equivalent corticosteroid doses). Because this protocol requires collection of autologous blood cells by leukapheresis in order to prepare CAR T cells, systemic anti-malignancy therapy including systemic corticosteroid therapy at doses greater than prednisone 5 mg/day or the equivalent corticosteroid doses is not allowed within 14 days prior to the required leukapheresis. NOTE: Because of the long half-life and potential to affect CAR T-cells, 30 days must elapse from the time of administration of anti-Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) or anti-Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibodies or other agents that in the opinion of the PI can stimulate immune activity and infusion of CAR T-cells.\n* Normal cardiac ejection fraction (greater than or equal to 50% by echocardiography) and no evidence of hemodynamically significant pericardial effusion as determined by an echocardiogram within 4 weeks of the start of the treatment protocol.\n* Patients must not take corticosteroids at doses higher than 5 mg/day of prednisone or the equivalent for 14 days before apheresis, and for 14 days prior to the conditioning chemotherapy regimen.\n* Patients must be willing to undergo endotracheal intubation, mechanical ventilation, dialysis, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and electrical defibrillation. Patients must be willing to receive vasopressor drugs and all other standard intensive care unit interventions.

Patients must not be taking any systemic steroids at doses greater than 5 mg/day prednisone or equivalent at all for 14 days prior to apheresis and initiation of chemotherapy.

    "exclusion_criteria": "",
    "miscellaneous_criteria": "* INCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\nMalignancy Criteria:\n\n* Patients must have anaplastic large cell lymphoma, angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma, peripheral T-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified, primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, grey zone lymphoma, enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma, or extranodal natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type\n* Clear TNFRSF8 (CD30) expression must be detected on 75% or more of malignant cells from either bone marrow or lymphoma mass by flow cytometry or immunohistochemistry. The patient's malignancy will need to be assessed for CD30 expression by flow cytometry or immunohistochemistry performed at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). If unstained, paraffin-embedded bone marrow or lymphoma sections are available from prior biopsies, these can be used to determine CD30 expression by immunohistochemistry; otherwise, patients will need to come to the NIH for a biopsy to determine CD30 expression. The sample for CD30 expression can come from a biopsy obtained at any time before enrollment, unless the patient has received a prior anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody, in which case the sample must come from a biopsy following completion of the most recent anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody treatment.\n* Eligible patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma must have received 2 prior treatment regimens at least 1 of which included an anthracycline and an anti-B-lymphocyte antigen CD20 (CD20) monoclonal antibody.\n* Patients must have measurable malignancy as defined by at least one of the criteria below.\n* Lymphoma mass that is measurable (minimum 1.5 cm in largest diameter) by computed tomography (CT) scan is required unless bone marrow lymphoma is detectable.\n* For a lymphoma mass to count as measurable malignancy, it must have abnormally increased metabolic activity when assessed by positron emission tomography (PET) scan.\n* For lymphoma with only bone marrow involvement, no mass is necessary, but if a mass is not present, bone marrow malignancy must be detectable by flow cytometry.\n\nOther"
