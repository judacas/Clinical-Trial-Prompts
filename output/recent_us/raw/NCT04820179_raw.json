Prior Bone Marrow-Stem Cell Transplant Subjects who have undergone autologous stem cell transplant (SCT) with disease progression or relapse following SCT are eligible. Subjects who have undergone allogeneic SCT will be eligible if, in addition to meeting other eligibility criteria, they are at least 100 days post transplant, they have no evidence of Graft versus host disease (GVHD) and have been without immunosuppressive agents for at least 30 days.\n5. Prior Therapy Wash-out\n\n   * At least 2 weeks or 5 half lives, whichever is shorter, must have elapsed since any prior systemic therapy at the time the subject is planned for leukapheresis, except for systemic inhibitory/stimulatory immune checkpoint therapy, which requires 5 half lives.\n   * Subjects with ALL may not have receive inotuzumab ozogamicin therapy within the past 4 months.\n\n   Exceptions:\n   * There is no time restriction with regard to prior intrathecal chemotherapy provided there is complete recovery from any acute toxic effects of such;\n   * Subjects receiving hydroxyurea may be enrolled provided there has been no increase in dose for at least 2 weeks prior to starting apheresis;\n   * Subjects who are on standard ALL maintenance type chemotherapy (vincristine, 6- mercaptopurine or oral methotrexate) may be enrolled provided that chemotherapy is discontinued at least 1 week or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter,prior to apheresis.\n   * Subjects receiving steroid therapy at physiologic replacement doses (≤ 5 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent doses of other corticosteroids) only are allowed provided there has been no increase in dose for at least 2 weeks prior to starting apheresis;\n   * For radiation therapy: Radiation therapy must have been completed at least 3 weeks prior to enrollment, with the exception that there is no time restriction if the volume of bone marrow treated is less than 10% and also the subject has measurable/evaluable disease outside the radiation port or the site of radiation has documented progression.\n6. Prior CAR Therapy Subjects who have undergone prior CAR therapy will be eligible if at least 30 days has elapsed prior to apheresis.\n7. Toxicities from Prior Therapy Toxicities due to prior therapy must be stable (except for clinically non significant toxicities such as alopecia)\n8.
