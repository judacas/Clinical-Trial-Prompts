    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Provision to sign and date the consent form.\n2. Age ≥ 18 years.\n3. Able to comply with the study protocol, in the investigator's judgment.\n4. Patient must state willingness to undergo pre- and post-treatment biopsies. According to the investigator's judgement, the planned biopsies should not expose the patient to substantially increased risk of complications.\n5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or one.\n6. Histologically confirmed unresectable metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma.\n7. Progression on at least two prior lines of therapy for unresectable metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma.\n\n   o Administration of bevacizumab previously does not impact study inclusion.\n8. Measurable disease, according to RECIST v1.1. Note that lesions intended to be biopsied should not be target lesions.\n9. Adequate hematologic and end organ function, defined by the following laboratory results obtained within 14 days prior to first dose of study drug treatment:\n\n   * WBC ≥ 2.5 and ≤ 15.0 × 109/L\n   * ANC ≥ 1.5 × 109/L\n   * Platelet count ≥ 100 × 109/L\n   * Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL without transfusion in the previous week\n   * Albumin ≥ 2.5 g/dL\n   * Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x the upper limit of normal (ULN); patients with known Gilbert's disease may have a bilirubin ≤ 3.0 ×ULN\n   * INR and PTT ≤ 1.5 × ULN; amylase and lipase ≤ 1.5 × ULN\n   * AST, ALT, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) ≤ 3 × ULN with the following exceptions:\n\n     * Patients with documented liver metastases: AST and/or ALT ≤ 5 ×ULN\n     * Patients with documented liver or bone metastases: ALP ≤ 5×ULN\n   * Creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min\n10. For women of childbearing potential: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use of contraceptive methods that result in a failure rate of < 1% per year during the treatment period and for at least 180 days after the last study treatment. A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is post-menarcheal, has not reached a postmenopausal state (≥ 12 continuous months of amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone surgical sterilization (removal of ovaries and/or uterus). Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of < 1% per year include bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, hormonal contraceptives that inhibit ovulation, hormone-releasing intrauterine devices and copper intrauterine devices. The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.\n11. For men: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive measures and agreement to refrain from donating sperm, as defined below: With female partners of childbearing potential or pregnant female partners, men must remain abstinent or use a condom during the treatment period and for at least 180 days after the last dose of study treatment. Men must refrain from donating sperm during this same period. The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 99 Years",
