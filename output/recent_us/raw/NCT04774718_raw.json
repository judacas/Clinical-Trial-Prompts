    "official_title": "A Pilot Study of Interrogating Biological Signaling Pathway Dysregulations and In Vitro Screening With Personalized Therapies in Resistant Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) - the MCL MATCH Trial",
    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Confirmed MCL tissue diagnosis with CD20- and Cyclin D1-positive cells or cyclin D1 negative but t (11;14) positive and diagnosis confirmed by pathologist from the tissue biopsy.\n2. Patients must have relapsed/refractory MCL.\n3. Understand and voluntarily sign an IRB-approved informed consent form.\n4. Patients must have a biopsy-accessible lesion and be willing to undergo biopsy.\n5. Patients must have bi-dimensional measurable disease per Cheson criteria (bone marrow or GI-only involvement is acceptable).\n6. Age ≥ 18 years at the time of signing the informed consent.\n7. Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.0 x 109/L, absolute lymphocyte count ≥ 0.6 x 109/L, platelet count ≥ 50 x 109/L\n8. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2.\n9. Patients must have adequate organ function for drugs(s) or combination being utilized (dependent on the drug (s) being given, the acceptable values of clinical parameters are given below: Biochemical values should be within the following limits:\n\n   1. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 3 x upper limit of normal (ULN)\n   2. Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN unless bilirubin rise is due to Gilbert's syndrome or of non-hepatic origin\n   3. Creatinine clearance (CLcr) > 30 mL/min\n10. Cardiac ejection fraction ≥ 50% by ECHO or MUGA.\n11. Women of childbearing potential (WCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test. Men must agree not to father a child and agree to use a condom if his partner is of child-bearing potential.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Any serious medical condition that places the patient at unacceptable risk and/or would prevent the subject from signing the informed consent form. Examples include but are not limited to uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, active/symptomatic coronary artery disease, active infection, active hemorrhage, and psychiatric illness.\n2. Patient with rapid progressive disease, warranting urgent immediate admission.\n3. Pregnant or breastfeeding females.\n4. Known HIV infection or active hepatitis B infection (not including patients with prior hepatitis B vaccination; or positive serum Hepatitis B antibody). Known hepatitis C infection is allowed as long as there is no active disease and is cleared by GI-Hepatology consultation.\n5. The patient has a prior or concurrent malignancy that, in the opinion of the investigator, presents a greater risk to the patient's health and survival than the MCL, with a life expectancy ≤ 1 year.\n6. Clinically significant cardiovascular disease such as uncontrolled or symptomatic arrhythmias, congestive heart failure or myocardial infarction within 6 months at the time of consent, or any cardiac disease defined by the New York Heart Association Classification as Class 3 (moderate) or 4 (severe).\n7. Prior chemotherapy within 2 weeks, nitrosoureas within 6 weeks, therapeutic anticancer antibodies within 2 weeks, radio- or toxin-immunoconjugates within 2 weeks, radiation therapy or other investigational agents within 1 week, major surgery within 4 weeks, or vaccination with live attenuated vaccines within 4 weeks of the first dose of start of assigned therapy.\n8. The patient receives corticosteroids for non-malignant conditions (e.g., asthma, inflammatory bowel disease) equivalent to a dexamethasone dose ≥ 4 mg/day or prednisone ≥ 20 mg/day.",
