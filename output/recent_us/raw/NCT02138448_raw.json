The effects of MEDI4736 and tremelimumab on the developing human fetus are unknown. Evidence of post-menopausal status or negative urinary or serum pregnancy test for female pre-menopausal patients. Women will be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrheic for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. The following age-specific requirements apply:\n12. Women <50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal treatments and if they have luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone levels in the post-menopausal range for the institution or underwent surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy)\n13. Women ≥50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments, had radiation-induced menopause with last menses >1 year ago, had chemotherapy-induced menopause with last menses >1 year ago, or underwent surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or hysterectomy)\n14. Females of childbearing potential who are sexually active with a non-sterilized male partner must use at least 1 highly effective method of contraception from the time of screening and must agree to continue using such precaution for 180 days after the last dose of durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy or 90 days after the last dose of durvalumab monotherapy. Non-sterilized male partners of female patient must use male condom plus spermicide throughout this period. Cessation of birth control after this point should be discussed with a responsible physician. Not engaging in sexual activity for the total duration of the drug treatment and the drug washout period is an acceptable practice; however, periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of birth control. Female patients should also refrain from breastfeeding throughout this period.\n15. Non-sterilized males who are sexually active with a female partner of childbearing potential must use a male condom plus spermicide from screening through 180 days after receipt of the final dose of durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy or 90 days after receipt of the final dose of durvalumab monotherapy. Not engaging in sexual activity is an acceptable practice; however, occasional abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of contraception. Male patients should refrain from sperm donation throughout this period\n16. Patient is willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study including undergoing treatment and scheduled visits and examinations including follow up\n17. Body weight >30 kg\n18. Cohort specific eligibility requirements:\n19. Ability to undergo a fresh tumor biopsy for the purpose of screening for this clinical trial (including able and willing to give valid written consent) or the ability to access an available archival tumor sample taken less than 6 months prior to study enrollment if a fresh tumor biopsy is not feasible with an acceptable clinical risk and no antecedent treatment has been done.\n20. MSS tumor as documented by either: IHC testing that does not suggest loss of MLH-1, MSH-2, PMS2 or MSH6. OR PCR testing that does not suggest MSI\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1.

Any unresolved toxicity NCI CTCAE Grade ≥2 from previous anticancer therapy with the exception of alopecia, vitiligo, and the laboratory values defined in the inclusion criteria\n\n   1. Patients with Grade ≥2 neuropathy will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis after consultation with the Study Physician\n   2. Patients with irreversible toxicity not reasonably expected to be exacerbated by treatment with durvalumab or tremelimumab may be included only after consultation with the Study Physician\n3. Major surgical procedure (as defined by the Investigator) within 28 days prior to the first dose of the IP (investigational product, in this study, specifically durvalumab + tremelimumab combination). Note: Local surgery of isolated lesions for palliative intent is acceptable\n4. History of allogenic organ transplantation\n5.

Uncontrolled intercurrent illness, including but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, interstitial lung disease, serious chronic gastrointestinal conditions associated with diarrhea, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirement, substantially increase risk of incurring AEs or compromise the ability of the patient to give written informed consent\n7.

History of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis\n9. Patients with untreated brain metastases, spinal cord compression, or leptomeningeal carcinomatosis should be excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis, because of symptoms that may arise form inflammatory reactions, and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events. Patients whose brain metastases have been treated may participate provided they show radiographic stability (defined as 2 brain images, both of which are obtained after treatment to the brain metastases. These imaging scans should both be obtained at least four weeks apart and show no evidence of intracranial progression). In addition, any neurologic symptoms that developed either as a result of the brain metastases or their treatment must have resolved or be stable either, without the use of steroids, or are stable on a steroid dose of <10mg/day of prednisone or its equivalent and anti-convulsants for at least 14 days prior to the start of treatment\n10.

Patients positive for hepatitis C (HCV) antibody are eligible only if polymerase chain reaction is negative for HCV RNA\n12.
