    "inclusion_criteria": "* Age >= 18 years. Both men and women and members of all races and ethnic groups will be included\n* Participants must have histologically or cytologically confirmed breast cancer or prostate cancer (hormone therapy excepted) who are in stage I-V with or without evidence of metastasis using the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) Simplified Disease Classification\n* Participants must be within 12 months of their first diagnosis of breast or prostate cancer\n* Criteria for solid tumors: Participants must have measurable disease, per doctor of medicine (MD) and data in medical record\n* Participants must have no history of autoimmune disease\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* If they have asthma. Rationale: forest oils may be a possible trigger for asthma\n* If they have a known allergy to citrus peel or pine forests. Rationale: forest oils may cause contact dermatitis and coughing\n* If they are unable to detect common odors from commercial fragrances. Rationale, forest oils are humidified as an aroma to be inhaled in the simulate the forest greenspace immersion (SFIT)\n* First diagnosis of breast or prostate cancer is longer than 12 months ago. Rationale, NK cell number recovery may be complete by this time after first treatment\n* Febrile illness/infection within previous two weeks. Rationale, immune biomarkers will reflect previous febrile illness\n* Current tobacco or tobacco use within 1 hour of start of SFIT. Rationale: forest oils may cause contact dermatitis and coughing\n* Prior autoimmune disease, are on immune-modulating therapies (endocrine therapy allowed). Rationale, because of their poor prognosis rather than being in early stages of cancer\n* Had surgery or invasive procedure in the past two months. Rationale, because of their poor prognosis rather than being in early stages of cancer\n* Inability to complete study requisites",
