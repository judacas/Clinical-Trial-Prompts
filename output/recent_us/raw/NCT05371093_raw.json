For patients with a positive hepatitis C antibody with prior treatment or natural resolution who have negative HCV RNA are eligible. Patients with untreated hepatitis C may enroll if hepatitis is stable, and the patient is not at risk for hepatic decompensation. For those on concurrent HCV treatment, the HCV RNA level should be below the limit of quantification.\n* Negative serum pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential.\n* For women of childbearing potential: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive methods, as defined below:\n\n  * Women must remain abstinent or use an acceptable contraceptive method during the treatment period and for 5 months after the final dose of atezolizumab and 6 months after the final dose of bevacizumab.\n  * A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is post-menarchal, has not reached a postmenopausal state (≥ 12 continuous months of amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone surgical sterilization (removal of ovaries and/or uterus). The definition of childbearing potential may be adapted for alignment with local guidelines or requirements.\n  * Examples of acceptable contraceptive methods include, male sterilization, hormonal contraceptives that inhibit ovulation, hormone-releasing intrauterine devices, and copper intrauterine devices.\n  * The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.

Men must refrain from donating sperm during this same period.\n  * The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not adequate methods of preventing drug exposure.\nHealthy volunteers allowed",
