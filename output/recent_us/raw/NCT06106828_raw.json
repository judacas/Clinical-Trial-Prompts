    "official_title": "Window Trial of Fluorescently Labeled Panitumumab (Panitumumab-IRDye800) in Head and Neck Cancer",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Willing to review and sign written informed consent.\n* Male or female patients age > 18 years.\n* Tissue confirmation of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.\n* Patients for whom a potentially curative resection is planned as standard of care.\n* Adequate hematologic and end-organ function appropriate for surgery as determined by routine preoperative evaluation. If liver function, renal function and hematologic laboratory test results are acceptable for elective surgery, the patient is considered eligible for the study. Laboratory results that will need to be obtained within 30 days prior to initiation of study treatment: Magnesium, Phosphorus, serum pregnancy test (for females of childbearing age).\n* For women of childbearing potential: Agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive methods as defined below:\n\n  • A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is post-menarchal, has not reached a postmenopausal state (12 continuous months of amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone surgical sterilization (removal of the uterus and/or both ovaries and/or both fallopian tubes). Post-menarchal is defined as either:\n  * age >55 years old\n  * age <55 years or less and\n* at least 12 months since last menstrual period,\n* at least 6 months since last menstrual period and FSH > 40 IU\n\n  * Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test result within 30 days prior to initiation of study treatment.\n  * Women must remain abstinent or use effective contraceptive methods during the treatment period and for 5 months after the final dose of panitumumab.\n  * Examples of highly effective methods of contraceptive include (a) partner vasectomy, (b) bilateral tubal ligation, (c) intrauterine devices (IUDs), (d) hormonal implants (such as Implanon), or (e) other hormonal methods (birth control pills, injections, patches, vaginal rings).\n  * Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not adequate methods of contraception.\n\nFor men: Agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use a condom, and agreement to refrain from donating sperm, as defined below:\n\n• With a female partner of childbearing potential or pregnant female partner, men must agree to remain abstinent or use a condom during the treatment period and for 5 months after the final dose of panitumumab/pan800 to avoid exposing the embryo. Men must agree to refrain from donating sperm during this same period.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Patients not eligible for standard of care surgical resection\n* Patients with a history of infusion reactions or allergic reactions to panitumumab.\n* History of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, organizing pneumonia (e.g., bronchiolitis obliterans), drug-induced pneumonitis, or idiopathic pneumonitis, or evidence of active pneumonitis on screening chest computed tomography (CT) scan.\n\n  • History of radiation pneumonitis in the radiation field (fibrosis) is permitted.\n* Active tuberculosis. Patients do NOT have to be screened for tuberculosis for this trial.\n* Significant cardiovascular disease (such as New York Heart Association Class II or greater cardiac disease, myocardial infarction, or cerebrovascular accident) within 3 months prior to initiation of study treatment, unstable arrhythmia, or unstable angina.\n* History of severe allergic anaphylactic reactions to chimeric or humanized antibodies or fusion proteins.\n* Patients receiving Class IA (quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (dofetilide, amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic agents. The following drugs are known to interact with panitumumab and therefore any patients taking these medications within 30 days will be ineligible for the trial.\n* Pregnancy or breastfeeding, or intention of becoming pregnant during study treatment or within 5 months after the final dose of study treatment.\n* Magnesium or phosphorus lower than normal institutional values unable to be corrected through standard repletion strategies.\n* Evidence of QT prolongation on pretreatment ECG (greater than 440 ms in males or greater that 450 ms in females).",
