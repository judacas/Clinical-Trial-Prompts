    "official_title": "A Multicentre, Open-label, Non-randomized, Phase 1b Trial of NG-350A, a Tumour-selective Anti-CD40-expressing Adenoviral Vector, in Combination With Chemoradiotherapy in Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer (FORTRESS)",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the rectum.\n* Locally advanced disease (clinical stage II-III based on pelvic MRI) selected by a multidisciplinary team for treatment with neoadjuvant CRT (which may be followed by CNCT to comprise planned TNT). Patients with oligometastatic disease are permitted provided that the site-specific multidisciplinary team deems them suitable for radical treatment/chemoradiation.\n* Confirmed microsatellite stable (MSS)/proficient mismatch repair (pMMR) status.\n* Provide written informed consent to participate.\n* ECOG Performance Status 0 or 1.\n* Must not be pregnant or breastfeeding.\n* Patients who are sexually active (with either sex) must agree to comply with contraceptive requirements.\n* Adequate lung reserve, renal function, hepatic function, and bone marrow/hematological function assessed ≤ 10 days prior to first dose.\n\nSelected\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Recurrent rectal cancer.\n* Distant metastatic disease not amenable to radical treatment/chemoradiation.\n* Other prior malignancy active within the previous 3 years, except for local or organ confined early-stage cancer that has been definitively treated with curative intent, does not require ongoing treatment, has no evidence of residual disease, and has a negligible risk of recurrence and is therefore unlikely to interfere with the primary and secondary endpoints of the trial, including response rate and safety.\n* Splenectomy (patients with prior partial resection remain eligible if the Investigator considers splenic function to not be significantly compromised).\n* Active autoimmune disease that has required systemic therapy in the past 2 years, immunocompromised status in the opinion of the Investigator, or current treatment with systemic immunosuppressive therapy (daily prednisone equivalent for chronic system replacement not to exceed 10mg per day).\n* Infectious or inflammatory bowel disease in the 3 months before the first dose of study treatment.\n* Any clinically significant cardiovascular, peripheral vascular, cerebrovascular, or thromboembolic event in the last 1 month before the first dose of study treatment.\n* Major surgery in the 14 days before the first dose of study treatment or any surgical wounds that are not fully healed and free of infection or dehiscence.\n* Any prior surgery for rectal cancer or pelvic radiotherapy.\n* Any other anti-cancer or experimental therapy within the previous 12 months or that is planned during the active study treatment period.\n* Treatment with any other enadenotucirev-based virus (parent virus or transgene-modified variants), or anti-CD40 antibody at any time.\n* History of prior Grade 3-4 acute kidney injury or other clinically significant renal impairment.\n* Any ongoing Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade ≥2 coagulation abnormality/coagulopathy.",
