    "inclusion_criteria": "Potential Subjects MUST:\n\n1. Sign and date an IRB-approved written Informed Consent Form prior to initiation of any study procedures;\n2. Be an adult male or female ≥ 18 and ≤ 80 years of age;\n3. Present for surgery with either:\n\n   1. Limb trauma and/or planned amputation of a limb and be candidates who are planned for a secondary nerve surgery such as Targeted Muscle Reinnervation (TMR) or Regenerative Peripheral Nerve Interface (RPNI) procedures within 6-12 months from time of amputation, or;\n   2. A previous amputation and be undergoing surgery to address nerve ends;\n4. Have at least one nerve end measuring greater than 4 mm and less than 7 mm in diameter after debridement and hemostasis of the proximal nerve stump;\n5. Have sufficient soft tissue available to be adequately covered by the Axoguard Nerve Cap;\n6. Be willing and able to comply with all aspects of the treatment and follow-up assessments and to return for all required study visits throughout the study duration.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 80 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "Potential Subjects MUST NOT:\n\n1. Currently undergoing or are expected to undergo treatment with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or other known treatment that affects the growth of neural and/or vascular tissues;\n2. Have signs and symptoms of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy from previous chemotherapy;\n3. Be immunosuppressed or have planned immunosuppressive therapy during the duration of the study;\n4. Current uncontrolled local or systemic infection as indicated by positive blood culture or other pathological indicators of infection;\n5. Be contraindicated for soft tissue implants. This includes but is not limited to any pathology that would limit the blood supply to the target area or otherwise compromise healing;\n6. Have a life expectancy of less than 15-months;\n7. Have a history of or be planning to undergo radiotherapy in the area of the end-neuroma;\n8. Have bony exostosis of the affected limb that is not treated at the time of nerve cap placement;\n9. Have uncontrolled Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus with HbA1c of 8% or greater or those with diabetic neuropathy in the target area or proximal to the amputation site;\n10. Have a history of idiopathic neuropathy/radiculopathy, known sciatica or chronic back pain;\n11. Documented history of centralized nerve pain that does not respond to a peripheral nerve block in the affected limb;\n12. Have a known allergy to anesthetic agents;\n13. Have a known sensitivity to porcine-derived products;\n14. Be currently enrolled or have been enrolled in another interventional clinical research study within the past 30 days (at time of consent); or\n15. Be deemed unsuitable for inclusion in the study at the discretion of the investigator.",
