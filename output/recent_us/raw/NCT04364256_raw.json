    "inclusion_criteria": "* Patients with cutaneous melanoma or unknown primary melanoma may enroll. Patients with uveal or mucosal or acral-lentiginous melanoma are excluded.\n* Male participants:\n\n  • A male participant must agree to use a contraception as detailed in Appendix 3 of this protocol during the treatment period and for at least 120 days after the last dose of study treatment and refrain from donating sperm during this period.\n* Female participants:\n\n  * A female participant is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant; not breastfeeding, and at least one of the following conditions applies:\n  * Not a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP); OR\n  * A WOCBP who agrees to follow the contraceptive guidanceper protocol during the treatment period and for at least 120 days after the last dose of study treatment.\n* Participants must have progressed on treatment with an anti-PD(L)1 ICI administered either as monotherapy or in combination with other checkpoint inhibitors or other standard/investigational therapies. PD-1 treatment progression is defined by meeting all the following criteria:\n\n  * Has received at least 2 doses of an approved anti-PD(L)1 ICI administered as a single agent, in combination with chemotherapy, and/or in combination with other investigational therapy.\n  * Participants who progressed on/within 3 months of adjuvant therapy with anti-PD(L)1 ICI will eligible.\n  * Demonstrated disease progression after anti-PD-1/L1 as defined by RECIST v1.1. The initial evidence of PD is to be confirmed by a second assessment no sooner than 4 weeks from the date of the first documented PD.\n  * Progressive disease has been documented within 12 weeks from the last dose of anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 mAb.\n  * NOTE: Progressive disease must be determined as above.\n  * NOTE: This determination is made by the treating investigator. Once PD is confirmed, the initial date of PD documentation will be considered the date of PD.\n  * NOTE: Anti-PD(L)1 ICI need not be the most recent line of therapy administered.\n* Patients with CNS disease are eligible if CNS metastases are treated and deemed stable prior to date of enrollment.\n\n  * NOTE: All patients will undergo CNS imaging at the time of Screening. Patients with treated brain metastases will need repeat CNS imaging to document stability.\n  * NOTE: Stability is defined based on appearance of treated lesions on a contrast-enhanced CT or MRI brain study performed as part of screening by radiologist, radiation oncologist or neurosurgeon (whichever is most appropriate); absence of new or enlarging brain metastases; and no longer requiring systemic steroids (≤ 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent) for at least one week prior to enrollment.\n  * NOTE: The contrast-enhanced CT or MRI brain imaging study should be performed no sooner than 2 weeks after most recent surgical and/or radiological intervention.\n  * NOTE: If lesions were discovered during Screening, the patient may be eligible if the lesions are treated and stable based on the above criteria.\n  * NOTE: Patients with leptomeningeal involvement (leptomeningeal enhancement on MRI/CT imaging and/or positive CSF cytology) are excluded regardless of stability.\n* Prior treatment(s)\n\n  • NOTE: Prior anti-CTLA-4 ICI is allowed but not required.\n\n  • NOTE: Given the clear benefit of immunotherapy (over BRAF/MEK inhibitor therapy) in BRAFV600 mutant melanoma, BRAFV600 mutant patients need not have received BRAF/MEK inhibitor therapy prior to enrollment.\n* Willingness to repeatedly receive FMT administered endoscopically (colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy) following necessary bowel preparation pre-procedure.\n\n  * NOTE: Understands infectious risks associated with FMT administration.\n\n    o Although FMT infusate has been screened for bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites there is a risk of transmission of known and unknown infectious organisms contained in the donor stool. Post-FMT bacteremia (e.g. E. coli), sepsis and fatal events may rarely occur.\n  * NOTE: Understands non-infectious risks associated with FMT administration.\n\n    * Possible allergy and/or anaphylaxis to antigens in donor stool.\n    * Theoretical risk of developing disease possibly related to donor gut microbiota including but not limited to: obesity, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, autoimmune conditions, allergic/atopic disorders, neurologic disorders, psychiatric conditions and malignancy.\n  * NOTE: Understand risks associated with endoscopy (colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy) including risk of infection transmission, colonic perforation, aspiration pneumonia, and death.\n  * NOTE: Understand that data regarding the long-term safety risk of FMT are lacking.\n* Presence of measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1.\n\n  * Patients need to have at least one measurable lesion and a separate lesion for biopsy. Patients with only 1 lesion may be enrolled after discussion with Sponsor-Investigator.\n  * Lesions situated in a previously irradiated area are considered measurable if progression has been demonstrated in such lesions.\n* Able to provide newly obtained core or excisional biopsy of a tumor lesion not previously irradiated to undergo tumor biopsy (core, punch, incisional or excisional).\n\n  • Biopsy must meet minimal sampling criteria as defined in the Schedule of Study Procedures (Section 5.10, Footnote N).\n* Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1.\n* Have adequate organ function per protocol.
