If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required (To be performed within 28 days prior to day 1 of protocol therapy unless otherwise stated)\n* Agreement by females and males of childbearing potential to use an effective method of birth control or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course of the study through at least 1 months after the last dose of protocol therapy.\n\n  * Childbearing potential defined as not being surgically sterilized (men and women) or have not been free from menses for > 1 year (women only)\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Current active treatment with chemotherapy, radiation or surgery in the past 3 months or planned treatment during this study protocol period. Note: Hormonal therapy is allowed\n* Treatment with any neuropathic agent including taxane, platinum, vinca alkaloid, or bortezomib chemotherapy within the past 6 months\n* Concurrent use of other alternative medicines such as medical cannabis, herbal agents and high dose vitamins and minerals\n* Liver cirrhosis Child-Pugh B or C\n* Mental incapacitation or significant emotional or psychological disorder that, in the opinion of the investigators, precludes study entry.
