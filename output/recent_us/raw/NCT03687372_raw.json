    "official_title": "A Phase 1b Study of Subcutaneous Daratumumab Regimens in Combination With Bispecific T Cell Redirection Antibodies for the Treatment of Subjects With Multiple Myeloma",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Documented initial diagnosis of multiple myeloma according to International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) diagnostic criteria\n* Must have either of the following: a) received at least 3 prior lines of therapy including a proteasome inhibitor (PI) (greater than or equal to [>=] 2 cycles or 2 months of treatment) and an immunomodulatory drug (IMiD) (>=2 cycles or 2 months of treatment) in any order during the treatment or b) disease that is double refractory to a PI and an IMiD\n* Measurable disease at screening as defined by any of the following: Serum monoclonal protein (M-protein) level >=1.0 grams per deciliter (g/dL) (in non- immunoglobulin G (IgG) myeloma, an M-protein level >=0.5 g/dL); or Urine M-protein level >=200 milligrams (mg)/24 hours; or Light chain multiple myeloma: Serum immunoglobulin (Ig) free light chain (FLC) >=10 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) and abnormal serum Ig kappa lambda FLC ratio\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status grade of 0 or 1 at screening and at Cycle 1, Day 1 predose\n* Female participants of childbearing potential must have a negative highly-sensitive serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) pregnancy test (less than [<] 5 international units per milliliter [IU/mL]) at screening and a negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 1 day before the first dose of study drug\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Treatment in the prior 3 months with an anti- cluster of differentiation 38 (CD38) therapy (example, daratumumab), or discontinuation of a prior anti-CD38 therapy at any time due to an adverse event related to the anti-CD38 therapy\n* Live, attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug unless approved by sponsor\n* Active Central nervous system involvement or exhibits clinical signs of meningeal involvement of multiple myeloma. If either is suspected, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and lumbar cytology are required\n* Seropositive for hepatitis B (defined by a positive test for hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]). Participants with resolved infection must be screened using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) measurement of hepatitis B virus (HBV) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) levels. Those who are PCR positive will be excluded\n* Active hepatitis C infection as measured by positive hepatitis C virus- ribonucleotide (HCV)-RNA testing. Participants with a history of Hepatitis C virus antibody positivity must undergo HCV-RNA testing",
