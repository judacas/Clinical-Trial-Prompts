    "official_title": "Open-label, Single-arm, Phase 2 Study of Initial Treatment With Elotuzumab, Carfilzomib (Kyprolis), Lenalidomide (Revlimid) and Low Dose Dexamethasone (E-KRd) in Newly Diagnosed, Multiple Myeloma Requiring Systemic Chemotherapy",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Subjects must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible to enroll in this study. No enrollment waivers will be granted.\n\n  1. Newly diagnosed, previously untreated myeloma requiring systemic chemotherapy\n\n     a. Prior treatment of hypercalcemia or spinal cord compression or active and/or aggressively progressing myeloma with corticosteroids and/or lenalidomide and/or bortezomib/PI-based regimens does not disqualify the subject (the corticosteroid treatment dose should not exceed the equivalent of 160 mg of dexamethasone in a 4 week period or not more than 1 cycle of lenalidomide and/or PI-based therapy)\n  2. Both transplant and non-transplant candidates are eligible.\n  3. Diagnosis of symptomatic multiple myeloma as per current IMWG uniform criteria prior to initial treatment\n  4. Monoclonal plasma cells in the BM 10% or presence of a biopsy-proven plasmacytoma\n  5. Measurable disease, prior to initial treatment as indicated by one or more of the following:\n\n     1. Serum M-protein ≥ 1 g/dL\n     2. Urine M-protein ≥ 200 mg/24 hours\n     3. If serum protein electrophoresis is felt to be unreliable for routine M-protein measurement, then quantitative immunoglobulin levels are acceptable (≥ 1 g/dL)\n     4. Involved serum free light chains ≥ 10 mg/dL provided that free light chain ratio is abnormal\n  6. Screening laboratory values must meet the following criteria and should be obtained within 21 days prior to enrollment WBC ≥ 2000/µL Platelets ≥ 75 x103/µL ANC >1000/µL Hemoglobin > 8.0 g/dL Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN or creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥ 50 mL/min\n\n     1. Use the Cockcroft-Gault formula below):\n\n        o Female CrCl = (140 - age in years) x weight in kg x 0.85\n        * 72 x serum creatinine in mg/dL\n\n          o Male CrCl = (140 - age in years) x weight in kg x 1.00\n        * 72 x serum creatinine in mg/dL\n     2. Alternatively to Cockcroft-Gault formula of CrCl, 24hr urine CrCl can be used AST/ALT ≤ 3 x ULN Total Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN (except subjects with Gilbert Syndrome, who can have total bilirubin < 3.0 mg/dL) or ≤ 2 x ULN if lenalidomide is being prescribed.\n  7. Males and females ≥ 18 years of age\n  8. ECOG performance status of 0-1\n  9. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must have 2 negative pregnancy tests (sensitivity of at least 50 mIU/mL) prior to initiating lenalidomide. The first pregnancy test must be performed within 10-14 days before and the second pregnancy test must be performed within 24 hours before lenalidomide is prescribed for Cycle 1 (prescriptions must be filled within 7 days).\n  10. FCBP must agree to use 2 reliable forms of contraception simultaneously or to practice complete abstinence from heterosexual intercourse during the following time periods related to this study: 1) for at least 28 days before starting lenalidomide; 2) while participating in the study; and 3) for at least 28 days after discontinuation from the study.\n  11. Male subjects must agree to use a latex condom during sexual contact with females of childbearing potential while participating in the study and for at least 28 days following discontinuation from the study even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy.\n  12. All study participants in the US must be consented to and registered into the mandatory Revlimid REMS program and be willing and able to comply with the requirements of Revlimid REMS.\n  13. Voluntary written informed consent\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
