    "exclusion_criteria": "* Prior systemic therapy with a MEK inhibitor\n* History of another malignancy\n\n  * Exception: patients who have been disease-free for 3 years or patients with a history of completely resected non-melanoma skin cancer and/or patients with indolent secondary malignancies, are eligible; consult the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) medical monitor if unsure whether second malignancies meet the requirements specified above\n* History of interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis requiring supplemental oxygen or treatment with oral or intravenously administered corticosteroids\n* Any major surgery, extensive radiotherapy, chemotherapy with delayed toxicity (e.g. doxorubicin), biologic therapy, or immunotherapy within 21 days prior to enrollment and/or daily or weekly chemotherapy (e.g. sunitinib, sorafenib and pazopanib) without the potential for delayed toxicity within 14 days prior to enrollment\n* Use of other investigational drugs within 28 days (or five half-lives, whichever is shorter; with a minimum of 14 days from the last dose) preceding the first dose of trametinib and during the study\n* Symptomatic or untreated leptomeningeal or brain metastases or spinal cord compression\n* Have a known immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reaction or idiosyncrasy to drugs chemically related to trametinib, or excipients or to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)\n* Current use of a prohibited medication; the following medications or non-drug therapies are prohibited:\n\n  * Other anti-cancer therapy while on study treatment; (note: megestrol [Megace] if used as an appetite stimulant is allowed)\n  * Concurrent treatment with bisphosphonates is permitted; however, treatment must be initiated prior to the first dose of study therapy; prophylactic use of bisphosphonates in patients without bone disease is not permitted, except for the treatment of osteoporosis\n  * Because the composition, pharmacokinetics (PK), and metabolism of many herbal supplements are unknown, the concurrent use of all herbal supplements is prohibited during the study (including, but not limited to, St. John's wort, kava, ephedra [ma huang], ginkgo biloba, dehydroepiandrosterone [DHEA], yohimbe, saw palmetto, or ginseng)\n* History or current evidence/risk of retinal vein occlusion (RVO)\n* History or evidence of cardiovascular risk including any of the following:\n\n  * A QT interval corrected for heart rate using the Bazett's formula QTcB >= 480 msec\n  * History or evidence of current clinically significant uncontrolled arrhythmias (exception: patients with controlled atrial fibrillation for > 30 days prior to randomization are eligible)\n  * History of acute coronary syndromes (including myocardial infarction and unstable angina), coronary angioplasty, or stenting within 6 months prior to randomization\n  * History or evidence of current >= class II congestive heart failure as defined by the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification system\n  * Treatment-refractory hypertension defined as a blood pressure of systolic > 140 mmHg and/or diastolic > 90 mmHg which cannot be controlled by anti-hypertensive therapy\n  * Patients with intra-cardiac defibrillators\n  * Known cardiac metastases\n* Known hepatitis B virus (HBV), or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (patients with chronic or cleared HBV and HCV infection are eligible)\n* Any serious and/or unstable pre-existing medical disorder (aside from malignancy exception above), psychiatric disorder, or other conditions that could interfere with subject's safety, obtaining informed consent or compliance to the study procedures\n* Trametinib was embryotoxic and abortifacient in rabbits at doses greater than or equal to those resulting in exposures approximately 0.3 times the human exposure at the recommended clinical dose. Therefore, the study drug must not be administered to pregnant women or nursing mothers; women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid pregnancy and use effective methods of contraception; men with a female partner of childbearing potential must have either had a prior vasectomy or agree to use effective contraception; if a female patient or a female partner of a patient becomes pregnant while the patient receives trametinib, the potential hazard to the fetus should be explained to the patient and partner (as applicable)\n* Inability to comply with protocol-required procedures",
