    "official_title": "Assessing the Impact of a Financial Navigation Program for Patients With Multiple Myeloma: a Randomized Controlled Trial",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* 1. Patients actively receiving systemic therapy at the ACC, defined as receiving any anti-myeloma treatment and at least monthly follow-up at PCAM4 or one of our satellite locations (CCH, Princeton, Lancaster, Cherry Hill, Valley Forge, Radnor)\n\n  * These patients will be approached/recruited in-person on the same date as their return visit (follow-up appointment for established patients)\n  * These patients may have already been seen by FA/SW (we will record this information and control for this in the final statistical models)\n  * The rationale for using the \"follow up at least monthly\" criterion is because it will allow our research coordinators to easily and readily review charts of patients scheduled for follow up with myeloma specialists. This strategy will only exclude patients who receive oral maintenance anti-myeloma therapy who follow up less than once monthly (e.g. lenalidomide maintenance only).\n\n    2. New patients expected to start therapy, who are expected to meet criterion #1.\n  * These patients will be approached/recruited at their first return visit.\n  * If these patients are not expected to return within 2 weeks of the initial visit, a telephone consent will be considered/offered\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* o Have completed induction treatment and have stopped all systemic treatment in preparation for an autologous stem cell transplant [SCT] (rationale: patients are pre-screened for being able to finance their transplant before proceeding)\n\n  * Are referred only for autologous SCT (they would not qualify by criterion #1, anyway)\n  * Actively receive systemic therapy but do not follow up more than once monthly",
