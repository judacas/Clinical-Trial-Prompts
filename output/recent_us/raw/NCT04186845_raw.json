If participant received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting study therapy)\n* Prior organ transplantation, other than allogeneic or autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.\n* Currently participating in a study and receiving study therapy, or participated in a study of an investigational agent and received study therapy or used an investigational device within 4 weeks of the first dose of treatment or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer.\n* Received a live vaccine within 30 days of the planned start of study drug. (Note: Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.)\n* Evidence of clinically significant immunosuppression including the following:\n\n  * Primary immunodeficiency state such as SCID\n  * Concurrent opportunistic infection\n* Receiving systemic immunosuppressive therapy (>2 weeks) including oral steroid doses > 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent within seven days prior to enrollment. In the setting of non-immune mediated indications for use, chronic/active low dose steroid use (equivalent to ≤ 10 mg/day prednisone) may be permitted at the discretion of the Principal Investigator (Note: Other steroid formulations or steroid use for other indications may be permitted and include: 1) Intranasal, inhaled, ocular, or topical steroids, or local steroid injection (e.g., intra-articular injection); 2) Systemic corticosteroids at physiologic doses ≤ 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent; 3) Steroids as premedication for hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., CT scan premedication)\n* History or evidence of symptomatic autoimmune disease (e.g., pneumonitis, glomerulonephritis, vasculitis, or other), or history of active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment (i.e., use of corticosteroids, immunosuppressive drugs or biological agents used for treatment of autoimmune diseases) in past two years prior to enrollment (Note: Replacement therapy [e.g., thyroxine for hypothyroidism, insulin for diabetes or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency] is not considered a form of systemic treatment for autoimmune disease.)\n* Evidence of clinically significant interstitial lung disease, history of interstitial lung disease, or active, noninfectious pneumonitis related to prior immunotherapy treatment\n* Uncontrolled medical condition including current active infection requiring systemic therapy or symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF) within six months that in the Investigator's opinion compromises the ability of the participant to complete all study-related requirements safely\n* Mean resting corrected QTcF interval ≥ 470 ms on a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) for males and females\n* History of unstable or deteriorating cardiovascular disease within the previous six months prior to screening, including but not limited to the following:\n\n  * Unstable angina or myocardial infarction (MI)\n  * Cerebrovascular accident (CVA)/stroke\n  * CHF (New York Heart Association [NYHA] Class III or IV)\n  * Uncontrolled clinically significant arrhythmias\n* Known to be positive for active Hepatitis B (HBV; Hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] reactive with detectable HBV DNA), or Hepatitis C (HCV; detectable HCV RNA [qualitative])\n\n  * Patients with chronic HBV (positive HBsAg and/or Hepatitis B core antibody [HBcAb] and negative HBV DNA by polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) are eligible for this study if they are on suppressive antiviral therapy and deemed safe by a gastroenterologist\n  * Patients who are HCV antibody (Ab)-positive but HCV RNA-negative due to prior treatment or natural resolution will be considered eligible\n* Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies) disease that is not controlled.
