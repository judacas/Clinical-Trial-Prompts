    "exclusion_criteria": "* Patients with known symptomatic brain metastases requiring steroids.

Lists including medications and substances known or with the potential to interact with the CYP3A4 isoenzymes\n* Prior therapy with a compound of the same mechanism as PF-05082566 (immunomodulation of 4-1BB)\n* Major surgery within 28 days of starting study treatment\n* Radiation therapy within 14 days of starting study treatment\n* Autoimmune disorders (e.g., Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, systemic lupus erythematosus) and other diseases that compromise or impair the immune system except patients who have grade 1 psoriasis (in remission or controlled with topical steroids) or mild degree of autoimmune thyroiditis that are controlled with medications\n* Active and clinically significant bacterial, fungal or viral infection including hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C (HCV), known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related illness (HIV testing is not required)\n* Unstable or serious concurrent medical conditions in the previous 6 months, e.g., pancreatitis, severe/unstable angina, prolonged QT interval corrected by Fridericia's formula (QTcF) > 470 msec (calculated as average of triplicate readings, taken no greater than 2 minutes apart, and no history of torsades de pointes or symptomatic corrected QT [QTc] abnormality), symptomatic congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction and/or pulmonary hypertension, ongoing maintenance therapy for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia, stroke, and uncontrolled major seizure disorder\n* Concurrent active malignancy other than non-melanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix\n* Patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding\n* Patients with intolerance to or who have had a severe allergic or anaphylactic reaction to antibodies or infused therapeutic proteins, or patients who have had a severe allergic or anaphylactic reaction to any of the substances included in the study drug (including excipients)\n* Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition, including recent (within the past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior, or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study",
