    "inclusion_criteria": "* Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) according to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria confirmed by bone marrow aspirate and biopsy within 12 weeks prior to first dose. A local laboratory report from this diagnostic bone marrow aspirate and biopsy must be approved by the sponsor\n* International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) low risk or intermediate-1 risk MDS\n* Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion dependent, 1) Received at least 4 units of RBCs over any 8 consecutive weeks during the 16 weeks prior to randomization, 2) Pretransfusion Hb must have been less than or equal to (<=)9.0 gram per deciliter (g/dL)\n* Adequate iron stores, defined as transferrin saturation greater than 20 percent (%) and serum ferritin greater than 400 nanogram per Milliliter (ng/mL), measured within the screening period, or adequate iron stores as demonstrated by recent (within 12 weeks prior to first dose) bone marrow examination with iron stain\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0, 1 or 2\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to talacotuzumab and daratumumab or their excipients\n* Received any chemotherapy, immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive therapy, corticosteroids (greater than [>]30 milligram per day [mg/day] prednisone or equivalent) within 28 days prior to randomization\n* Received other treatments for MDS within 28 days prior to first dose (example [eg], azacitidine, decitabine, lenalidomide, Erythropoiesis-Stimulating Agent (ESA) (8 weeks for long-acting ESAs)\n* History of hematopoietic stem cell transplant\n* Del(5q) karyotype unless treatment with lenalidomide has failed. Failure is defined as either: 1) having received at least 3 months of lenalidomide treatment without RBC transfusion benefit (International Working Group [IWG] 2006); 2) progression or relapse after hematologic improvement with lenalidomide (IWG 2006); 3) discontinuation of lenalidomide due to toxicity; or 4) unable to receive lenalidomide due to a contraindication. Source documentation for lenalidomide treatment failure must be verified by the sponsor",
