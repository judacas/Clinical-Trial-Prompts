Agree not to use any other medication that acts on the central nervous system (prescription or nonprescription) 1 week prior to or during any study session (caffeine is the only exception, subjects are recommended to avoid caffeine for one week prior to a study session, but are required to avoid caffeine for 24 hours prior to and during a study session).\n11.

The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the investigational product (whichever is longer).\n10. Pregnant or breast-feeding.\n11. Taking a steroidal contraceptive drug or drugs.\n12.
