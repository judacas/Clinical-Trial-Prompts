    "official_title": "A Multicenter Phase 2 Study to Evaluate Subcutaneous Daratumumab in Combination With Standard Multiple Myeloma Treatment Regimens",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Multiple myeloma diagnosed according to the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) diagnostic criteria\n* Measurable, secretory disease as defined by any of the following:\n\n  1. Serum monoclonal paraprotein (M-protein) level greater than or equal to (>=) 1.0 gram per deciliter (g/dL); or\n  2. Urine M-protein level >= 200 milligram per 24 hours (mg/24 hours); or\n  3. Light chain multiple myeloma (MM), for participants without measurable disease in the serum or urine: serum Immunoglobulin (Ig) free light chain (FLC) >= 10 mg/dL and abnormal FLC ratio\n* Meets one of the sets of the following criteria:\n\n  1. For Daratumumab + bortezomib + lenalidomide + dexamethasone (D-VRd) and Daratumumab + bortezomib + melphalan + prednisone + dexamethasone (D-VMP) regimen: newly diagnosed myeloma\n  2. For Daratumumab + lenalidomide + dexamethasone (D-Rd) and Daratumumab + Carfilzomib + Dexamethasone (D-Kd) regimen: relapsed or refractory disease\n  3. D-Kd cohort: Participants must have received only 1 prior line of therapy for MM which included at least 2 consecutive cycles of lenalidomide therapy\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status grade of 0, 1, or 2\n* During the study, during dose interruptions, and for 3 months after receiving the last dose of any component of the study treatment, a female participant must agree not to donate eggs (ova, oocytes) and male participants of reproductive potential must not donate semen or sperm during the study, during dose interruptions, or for 3 months after the last dose of any study drug\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* History of malignancy (other than MM) unless all treatment of that malignancy was completed at least 2 years before consent and the participant has no evidence of disease further exceptions are squamous and basal cell carcinomas of the skin and carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or breast, or other non-invasive lesion, that in the opinion of the investigator, with concurrence with the sponsor's medical monitor, is considered cured with minimal risk of recurrence within 3 years\n* Exhibits clinical signs of meningeal involvement of MM\n* Either of the following: a) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) is less than (<) 50 percentage (%) of predicted normal b) Moderate or severe persistent asthma, or a history of asthma within the last 2 years, or currently has uncontrolled asthma of any classification c) For D-Kd cohort: Known infiltrative pulmonary disease or known pulmonary hypertension\n* Any of the following: a) Known to be seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus; b) Seropositive for hepatitis B (defined by a positive test for hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]). Participants with resolved infection (participants who are HBsAg negative but positive for antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen [Anti-HBc] and/or antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen [Anti-HBs]) must be screened using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) measurement of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA levels. Those who are polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive will be excluded\n* Known to be seropositive for hepatitis C (Anti-HCV antibody positive or HCV-RNA quantitation positive) except in the setting of a sustained virologic response [SVR], defined as aviremia at least 12 weeks after completion of antiviral therapy\n* For D-Kd cohort only: Transthoracic echocardiogram showing left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <40%; uncontrolled hypertension, defined as an average systolic blood pressure greater than (>)159 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) or diastolic >99 mmHg despite optimal treatment",
