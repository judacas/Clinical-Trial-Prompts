    "exclusion_criteria": "Study subjects meeting any of the following criteria will not be allowed to enroll in the study:\n\n1. History of chronic infectious disease, such as HIV or untreated or active hepatitis;\n2. History of tuberculosis, positive interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA, also known as the QuantiFERON-TB test), including a test with a high reactivity to mycobacteria of non-tuberculosis variety;\n3. Prior BCG vaccination, positive T-spot tuberculosis test or a T-spot test showing significant Mycobacteria exposure;\n4. A positive Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) result within 3 months of screening, or known close contact with a confirmed Coronavirus 19 (COVID-19) positive person or symptoms highly suspicious for COVID-19 (per Center for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines) within 1 month of screening, including fever, cough, shortness of breath, chills, muscle pain, new loss of taste or smell, vomiting or diarrhea, and/or sore throat, based on clinician's judgment;\n5. History of treatment with metformin within the past one year;\n6. Previous participation (ever) in active immunization research for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) or passive immunotherapy or other disease-modifying treatments for AD within the past three months;\n7. Current treatment with immunosuppressants (calcineurin inhibitors, corticosteroids, or biological or cytotoxic immunosuppressants, or disease or condition likely to require high dose steroid or immunosuppressive therapy);\n8. Other conditions or treatments associated with increased risk of infections or treatment with immunosuppressive medications for any reason;\n9. Current treatment with aspirin > 160 mg/day or chronic, daily nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs);\n10. Chronic use of antibiotics;\n11. History of keloid formation;\n12.

Other/confounding neurological or psychiatric condition, unstable medical or psychiatric conditions, contraindications to BCG use and lab abnormalities or concurrent medication use posing risk for BCG or study procedures;\n14. Laboratory abnormalities in B12, Folate, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), or other common laboratory parameters that may contribute to cognitive dysfunction;\n15. Laboratory abnormalities in Complete Blood Count (CBC), electrolytes, Liver Function Tests (LFTs), Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN), Creatinine (Cr), total serum immunoglobulins, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C reactive protein (CRP), or urinalysis posing risk to treatment with BCG per clinician judgment;\n16. Laboratory abnormalities in prothrombin time /international normalized ratio (PT-INR), which would pose a risk to performing the lumbar puncture procedure;\n17. Discontinuation of cholinesterase inhibitor or memantine within one month (28 days) prior to baseline visit;\n18. Females who are pregnant, lactating or of child-bearing potential;\n19. If male with female partner(s) of childbearing potential, unwilling or unable to adhere to contraception requirements specified in the protocol.\n20. Administration of live vaccine <60 days prior to Baseline.\n21.
