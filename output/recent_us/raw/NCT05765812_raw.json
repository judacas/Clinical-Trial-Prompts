    "official_title": "Promoting HPV Vaccination Among Young Adults in Texas",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Age 18-26 years. This criterion is based on the CDC recommendation of vaccination up to 26 years of age and the fact that individuals 18 years and older can consent by themselves for on-site vaccination\n* Ability to read and understand English\n* Self-identification as not yet having received any HPV vaccine injections. Self-identification is justified because it is safe to be vaccinated again, which could happen if a previously vaccinated person forgets their vaccination. Furthermore, in a person previously vaccinated with an older version of the vaccine, which targeted fewer HPV types, receiving the newer version would be advantageous and not cause any harm. Alternatives to self-identification, such as obtaining medical records from doctors' offices, would be very challenging for young adults, especially for those who do not remember when and where they might have received vaccination\n* Access to a smart phone, tablet or computer that is connected to the internet\n* Current enrollment in one of the participating schools with an anticipated continuous enrollment of at least 9 months\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 26 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Being pregnant\n* Having a life-threatening allergy to any component of the HPV vaccine",
