Timepoints for entering LTS17367 are Weeks 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48 or 52.\n    * The third group: participants at Week 24 in DRI17366 who have been re-randomized and who subsequently complete the study to Week 52, enter safety follow-up and experience worsening of their AD during safety follow-up.\n  * Participated in DRI17366 completing the previous study safety follow up (Week 68) and wish to re-initiate treatment with amlitelimab up to one year after the last visit\n* Complied with the previous clinical trial protocol to the satisfaction of the investigator\n* Body weight must be ≥25 kg\n* Provided signed informed assent/or consent and able to comply with the requirements of the protocol\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 12 Years",

Have a history of prior documented completed chemoprophylaxis for latent TB infection (with a treatment regimen as per local guidelines), OR treated for active TB infection\n  2. Have been in written form approved for participation in the present trial by a TB specialist who ruled out latent or active TB infection or other mycobacterial infection in the participant\n  3. For whom review and approval from Sponsor have been granted are eligible\n* Severe concomitant illness that would in the Investigator's opinion inhibit the participant's participation in the study, including for example, but not limited to, hypertension, renal disease, neurological conditions, heart failure and pulmonary disease\n* Skin co-morbidity that would adversely affect the ability to undertake AD assessments (e.g., psoriasis, tinea corporis, lupus erythematosus) as per Investigator's judgment\n* Any medical condition which, in the opinion of the Investigator may present an unreasonable risk to the study participant as a result of his/her participation in this clinical study, may make participant's participation unreliable, or may interfere with study assessments\n* In the Investigator's opinion, medical conditions related to prior AD medications that have not healed/fully recovered for more than 2 weeks before screening visit, including, but not limited to, conjunctivitis, keratitis, eosinophilic conditions, arthralgia, herpes zoster, thrombosis\n\nThe above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's potential participation in a clinical trial.",
