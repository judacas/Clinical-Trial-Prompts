    "official_title": "Feasibility, Acceptability, and Preliminary Efficacy of an Internet-based Parent-child Interaction Therapy (I-PCIT) Intervention for Children With Cancer",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Participants will be parents of 2-12 year-old children who (1) currently or previously received cancer treatment and/or long-term cancer follow-up care at Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital (JHACH).\n* The child's cancer treatment must have included or plan to include chemotherapy and/or radiation.\n* The child's cancer diagnosis must have been conferred at least 6 weeks prior to study enrollment. If a patient's cancer relapses during the study period, the patient's oncologist must agree to the patient continuing in this intervention.\n* The parent must have access to reliable internet service (e.g., in their own home, in a friend or family member's home, via cell phone carrier) and their own smartphone, tablet, or computer to participate in telehealth intervention sessions.\nHealthy volunteers allowed",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Parents will be excluded if they or their child have cognitive, motor, or language delays that would preclude participation, as observed by research staff or listed in the child's medical record. Hearing impaired parents will also be excluded because I-PCIT requires the coach to verbally coach parents via bug-in-ear.\n* Parents will be excluded if their child is expected to undergo bone marrow transplant (BMT) during the study or has received BMT within 2 months of study enrollment.\n* The child must not be receiving end of life care, as determined by medical chart review and/or consultation with the patient's medical team.",
