    "inclusion_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria\n\n1. Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed malignancy of epithelial origin other than ovarian cancer that is metastatic or unresectable and for which standard curative or palliative measures do not exist or are no longer effective. Patients must have received at least one prior line of systemic standard therapy, and have either disease progression or intolerable toxicity after standard treatment.\n2. In the dose expansion, Regimen A will enroll patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer with concurrent oxaliplatin and irinotecan-free interval ≥4 months (Cohort 1), Regimen B will enroll patients with metastatic colorectal cancer concurrent oxaliplatin and irinotecan-free interval ≥4 months (Cohort 2), Regimen C will enroll patients with metastatic solid tumors of epithelial origin who have received prior anti-PD-(L)1 therapy (Cohort 3), and Regimen D will enroll patients with metastatic castration-resistant and taxane-treated prostate cancer (Cohort 4).\n3. Patients (with the exception of those with prostate cancer) must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for non-nodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as ≥10 mm (≥1 cm) with computed tomography (CT) scan,PET-CT, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, or calipers by clinical exam.\n\n   Note: Prostate cancer patients must meet ≥1 of the following Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 3 criteria [95]:\n   * Progression in measurable disease.\n   * Bone disease progression defined by the appearance of ≥2 new bone lesions.\n   * Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression defined as ≥2 sequential rises in PSA obtained ≥1 week apart with a minimal starting value of ≥1 ng/mL.

Patients whose baseline pulse oximetry is at least 90% on room air.\n\n10. Fridericia's corrected QT interval (QTcF =QT/∛(60/HR) ) ≤460 ms for males and ≤480 ms for females on electrocardiogram (ECG) conducted at rest during screening.\n\nNote: Patients with an atrioventricular pacemaker or other condition (e.g., right bundle branch block) that renders the QT measurement invalid are an exception and this criterion does not apply.\n\n11. The effects of study drugs on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because Class II drugs as well as other therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control, abstinence) prior to study entry, throughout the study treatment period, and for 6 months after study treatment completion (Refer to Pregnancy Assessment Policy MDACC Institutional Policy # CLN1114). This includes all female patients, between the onset of menses (as early as 8 years of age) and 55 years unless the patient presents with an applicable exclusionary factor which may be one of the following:\n\n* Postmenopausal (no menses in greater than or equal to 12 consecutive months).\n* History of hysterectomy or bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.\n* Ovarian failure (follicle-stimulating hormone and estradiol in menopausal range and have received whole pelvic radiation therapy).\n* History of bilateral tubal ligation or another surgical sterilization procedure.\n* Approved methods of birth control are as follows: Hormonal contraception (i.e., birth control pills, injection, implant, transdermal patch, vaginal ring), intrauterine device (IUD), tubal ligation or hysterectomy, subject/partner post vasectomy, implantable or injectable contraceptives, and condoms plus spermicide. Not engaging in sexual activity for the total duration of the trial and the drug washout period is an acceptable practice; however, periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of birth control. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.\n\n  12. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 3 days prior to study treatment initiation (Cycle 1 Day 1).\n\n  13. Men and women enrolled on this protocol must agree to use adequate contraception during the study treatment period and for 6 months after completion of study treatment.\n\n  14. Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimens are eligible for this trial.\n* Agree to provide baseline tumor specimens: archival tissue block, or 10 FFPE slides, or a pre-treatment biopsy.\n* Patients must have adequate washout from prior therapy at the time of study treatment initiation: 3 weeks from any treatment specifically for systemic tumor control; 2 weeks from cytotoxic agents that were administered weekly; 6 weeks from nitrosoureas or mitomycin C; and 5 half-lives from targeted agents with half-lives and pharmacodynamic effects lasting <5 days.\n\nExclusion Criteria\n\n1. Has received an investigational non-myelosuppressive agent within 14 days prior to study treatment initiation or an investigational myelosuppressive agent within 21 days prior to study treatment initiation.\n2.

Patients must have complete wound healing from major or minor surgery before the first dose of study treatment.\n6. Currently receiving an investigational drug in a clinical trial or participating in any other type of medical research judged not to be scientifically or medically compatible with this study.

COVID-19 vaccines including killed virus are allowed.\n8. Symptomatic primary tumors or metastasis in the brain and/or central nervous system (CNS) that are uncontrolled with antiepileptics and/or require prednisone >10 mg/day or equivalent.\n\n   Note: Patients with treated brain metastases are eligible if follow-up brain imaging after CNS-directed therapy shows no evidence of progression. Patients with asymptomatic, new, or progressive brain metastases (active brain metastases) are eligible if the treating physician determines that immediate CNS-specific treatment is not required and is unlikely to be required during the first cycle of study treatment.\n9.
