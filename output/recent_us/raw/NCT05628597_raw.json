Any other disease, physical examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding that, in the investigator's opinion, gives reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that contraindicates the use of an investigational drug, may affect the interpretation of the results, render the patient at high risk from treatment complications or interferes with obtaining informed consent.\n3.

Treatment with any of the following:\n\n    * Nitrosourea or mitomycin C within 6 weeks of the first dose of study treatment\n    * Potent inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 within 2 weeks before the start of study treatment (3 weeks for St John's wort), or sensitive substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and/or CYP2D6 with a narrow therapeutic window within 1 week before the start of study treatment\n    * Drugs known to prolong the QT interval within 5 half-lives of the first dose of study treatment\n    * Any concomitant medication that may interfere with abiraterone safety and efficacy based on the prescribing information of abiraterone and local clinical guidelines\n16. History of hypersensitivity to active or inactive excipients of capivasertib, abiraterone, or drugs with a similar chemical structure or class.\n17.
