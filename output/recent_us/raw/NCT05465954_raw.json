This includes use of biologics for AD (for example, dupilumab and tralokinumab) during the safety follow-up period of Study KGAA.",
    "miscellaneous_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria for participants coming from a parent study:\n\nParticipants must meet all the following criteria to be eligible for this study:\n\n* Received treatment in a lebrikizumab study, NCT04146363, NCT04178967, NCT04250337, NCT04250350 and have adequately completed the study treatments and last patient visit of the parent trial.\n* For women of childbearing potential: agree to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use a highly effective contraceptive method during the treatment period and for at least 18 weeks after the last dose of lebrikizumab or placebo.\n\nExclusion Criteria for participants coming from a parent study:\n\nParticipants meeting any of the criteria below will not be included in this study:\n\n* Participants who, during their participation in the parent trial, developed a serious adverse event (SAE) deemed related to lebrikizumab, which in the opinion of the investigator or of the medical monitor could indicate that continued treatment with lebrikizumab may present an unreasonable risk for the participant. *\n* Participants who, during their participation in the parent trial, developed an AE that was deemed related to lebrikizumab and led to study treatment discontinuation, which in the opinion of the investigator or of the medical monitor could indicate that continued treatment with lebrikizumab may present an unreasonable risk for the participant. *\n* Conditions in the previous parent study consistent with protocol-defined criteria for permanent study drug discontinuation, if deemed related to lebrikizumab or led to investigator - or sponsor-initiated withdrawal of participant from the study (e.g., non-compliance, inability to complete study assessments, etc.). *\n* Pregnant or breastfeeding women, or women planning to become pregnant or breastfeed during the study.\n\nOpen-Label Addendum"
