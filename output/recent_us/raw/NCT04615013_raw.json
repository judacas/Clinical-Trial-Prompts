No concern for active concomitant GI infection at the time of initiation of protocol therapy as confirmed by stool tests or as per the treating physician based on clinical presentation\n7. Participant has been cleared for enrollment by Infectious Diseases consultant or treating physician if positive infection workup or screening tests (e.g., lifelong positive T-spot due to BCG inoculation, chronic colonization) prior to initiation of protocol therapy\n8.

Immunosuppressive treatment at onset of ICPI-induced diarrhea/colitis\n7. Any medical conditions (e.g. severe heart failure, brain hemorrhage, septic shock, etc.) that are high risk for colonoscopy procedure by the assessment of the study PI or Co-PIs.\n8.
