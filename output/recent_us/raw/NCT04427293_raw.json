Subject has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 2. has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months)\n  * Highly effective birth control methods (less than 1% failure rate per year if used consistently and correctly) include but are not limited to: 1. Oral, injected, or implanted hormonal method of contraception; 2. Place of intrauterine device (IUD) or system (IUS); 3. Tubal ligation (tubes tied) or a sterile partner (effective bilateral vasectomy)\n* Subjects must not breastfeed a child during the study and for 3 months after the last dose of study drug\n* Ability to understand and willingness to sign the written informed consent document\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
