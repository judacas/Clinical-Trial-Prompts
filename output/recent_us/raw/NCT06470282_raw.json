Therapy with heparin, low molecular weight heparin, or fondaparinux is allowed.\n* Patient is currently receiving treatment with drugs known to be strong inhibitors or inducers of isoenzymes CYP3A or CYP2C8. The patient must have discontinued strong inducers for at least 1 week and must have discontinued strong inhibitors before the start of the study treatment. Switching to a different medication prior to initiation of the trial treatment is allowed.\n* Patient has impaired gastrointestinal (GI) function or GI disease that may significantly alter the absorption of oral BYL719 (e.g., ulcerative disease, uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome, or small bowel resection).\n* Patient has known positive serology for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).\n* Patient has any other condition that would, in the investigators' judgment, preclude the patient's participation in the clinical study due to concerns about safety or compliance with clinical study procedures; e.g., infection/inflammation, intestinal obstruction, inability to swallow oral medication, social/psychological complications.\n* Patient has a history of noncompliance to medical regimens or is unable to grant consent.\n* Female patients of childbearing potential have positive urine or serum pregnancy test no more than 7 days prior to starting study drug.\n* Female patients of childbearing potential are not willing to use highly effective contraception to prevent pregnancy or agree to abstain from heterosexual activity throughout the study.
