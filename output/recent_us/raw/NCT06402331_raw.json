It is acceptable to administer medication via a g-tube if participant has a g-tube. It is not acceptable to place a g-tube for the purpose of delivering study medication.\n* Participants must have a Lansky (≤ 16 years) or Karnofsky (> 16 years) score of at least 50 and, in the opinion of the investigator, a minimum life expectancy of at least 6 weeks at the time of study enrollment.\n\n  * Note: Patients who are unable to walk because of paralysis, but who are up in a wheelchair, will be considered ambulatory for the purpose of assessing the performance score.\n* Participant must have adequate bone marrow and organ function defined as:\n\n  * ANC ≥ 1000/mm3 without growth factor support within 7 days of the test\n  * Platelet count ≥ 50,000/mm^3 without support of a platelet transfusion within 7 days of the test\n  * Hemoglobin ≥ 8.0 g/dL without support of a blood transfusion within 7 days of the test\n  * Creatinine clearance ≥ 70 mL/min/1.73 m^2 or serum creatinine ≤ the maximum serum creatinine based on age/gender (threshold creatinine values derived from the Schwartz formula for estimating GFR utilizing child length and stature data published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or creatinine clearance ≥70 mL/min/1.73 m^2).\n  * Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 3 x ULN. For the purposes of eligibility the ULN of ALT and AST is 45 U/L.\n  * Total bilirubin ≤ ULN or if > ULN then direct bilirubin ≤ 1.5xULN.\n* Participants and/or guardian have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document according to institutional guidelines.\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA - OVERALL STUDY - ALL PARTICIPANTS:\n\n* Participants receiving any other investigational agents.\n* Participants with other clinically significant medical disorders (serious infections or significant cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic, psychiatric, GI disease, or other organ dysfunction) that in the investigator's judgment could compromise their ability to tolerate or absorb protocol therapy or would interfere with the study procedures or results.\n* Female participants who are breastfeeding a child.\n* Participants with QTc interval of > 450 msec on screening ECG.\n* Participants with a pathogenic somatic or known germline retinoblastoma (RB1) gene mutation.\n\n(A) INCLUSION CRITERIA - STRATUM A PARTICIPANTS ONLY:\n\n* Participants with recurrent, progressive, or refractory Non-WNT Non-SHH (NWNS) Medulloblastoma or Ependymoma as confirmed through central pathology review.\n* Age ≥ 1 year and < 25 years at the time of enrollment.\n* Female participants of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at the time of enrollment on this study and be willing to use a highly effective method of contraception throughout the study and for 16 weeks after discontinuation of the study drug.\n* Male participants of child fathering potential must be willing to use medically acceptable form of contraception during treatment and for 16 weeks after stopping treatment.\n\n(A) EXCLUSION CRITERIA - STRATUM A PARTICIPANTS ONLY:\n\n* Participants with subependymoma or myxopapillary ependymoma.\n\n(B) INCLUSION CRITERIA - STRATUM B PARTICIPANTS ONLY:\n\n* Participants with recurrent, progressive, or refractory CNS tumors as confirmed through central pathology review and whose diagnosis is being treated on this study.\n* Age ≥ 1 year and < 25 years at the time of study enrollment.\n* Must meet the following weight and BSA restrictions:\n\n  * For enrollment on dose levels 0A, must have a weight ≥16kg and <32kg.\n  * For enrollment on dose level 0B, must have a weight of ≥32kg and BSA ≥ 0.55m^2.\n  * For enrollment on dose level 1, must have a weight ≥16kg and BSA ≥0.55m^2.\n  * For enrollment on dose level 2, must have a weight ≥16kg and BSA≥ 0.63m^2\n  * For enrollment on dose levels 3 or 4A, must have a weight ≥16kg\n  * For enrollment on dose levels 4B or 5, must have a weight ≥20kg and ≤106kg\n* Participant must be able to swallow trametinib tablets.\n* Female participants of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at the time of enrollment on this study and be willing to use a highly effective method of contraception throughout the study and for 16 weeks after discontinuation of the study drug.\n* Male participants of child fathering potential must be willing to use medically acceptable form of contraception during treatment and for 16 weeks after stopping treatment.\n\n(B) EXCLUSION CRITERIA - STRATUM B PARTICIPANTS ONLY: Participants eligible for this study must NOT meet ANY of the following criteria.\n\n* Participants with Low Grade Glioma (LGG) or Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG).\n* Previous exposure to a MEK inhibitor (i.e. trametinib, selumetinib).\n* Participants with abnormal LVEF on screening, defined as > 10% below lower limit of normal on screening.\n* Participants with retinal vein occlusion (RVO).\n* Previous exposure to a MEK inhibitor (i.e., trametinib, selumetinib.\n\n(C) INCLUSION CRITERIA - STRATUM C PARTICIPANTS ONLY:\n\n* Participants with recurrent, progressive, or refractory SHH Medulloblastoma and presence of either a or b as confirmed by central pathology review of the tumor specimen: a) copy number loss of 9q b) PTCH1 mutation and whose diagnosis is being treated on this study.\n* Age ≥ 10 years and <40 years at the time of study enrollment.\n* Participant must be skeletally mature as defined as females with a bone age ≥ 15 years (180 months) and males with a bone age ≥ 17 years (204 months).
