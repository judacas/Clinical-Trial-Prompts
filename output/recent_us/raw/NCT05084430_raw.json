    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Informed Consent: Signed informed consent by the participant or legally authorized representative.\n2. Age & Performance Status:\n\n   * Age ≥ 18 years\n   * ECOG performance status ≤ 2\n3. Diagnosis & Disease Criteria:\n\n   * Histologically confirmed B-NHL, including LBCL, MCL, and FL/MZL subtypes meeting specified prior treatment conditions.\n   * BAFF-R expression on lymphoma cells required.\n4. Measurable Disease: Tumor ≥1.5 cm on CT/PET scan or evidence of disease in blood, BM, GI, skin, or spleen.\n5. Prior CAR T-cell Therapy: Allowed if ≥ 3 months since last treatment and CD19 CAR-T persistence < 5% before leukapheresis.\n6. Organ Function & Laboratory Criteria:\n\n   * Hematologic: ANC ≥ 1000/μL, Platelets ≥ 75,000/μL (exceptions for BM involvement).\n   * Liver Function: Bilirubin ≤ 1.5x ULN (except Gilbert's), AST/ALT < 3x ULN.\n   * Renal Function: CrCl ≥ 50 mL/min.\n   * Cardiac & Pulmonary: LVEF ≥ 45%, QTcF ≤ 480 ms, O₂ saturation > 91% on room air.\n7. Infectious Disease Screening: Seronegative for HIV, active HBV, active HCV (or undetectable viral load if positive).\n8. Reproductive Considerations:\n\n   * Negative pregnancy test for females of childbearing potential.\n   * Use of effective contraception or abstinence through 3 months post-treatment.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Prior Therapies & Transplants:\n\n   * Prior allogeneic SCT.\n   * Autologous SCT < 6 months before leukapheresis.\n   * Concurrent systemic steroids or chronic immunosuppressant use.\n2. Disease-Specific Exclusions:\n\n   * Cardiac lymphoma involvement.\n   * Need for urgent therapy due to tumor-related complications (e.g., bowel obstruction).\n3. Medical Conditions:\n\n   * Active autoimmune disease requiring immunosuppressants.\n   * Primary immunodeficiency.\n   * Cardiac conditions, including NYHA Class III/IV heart disease, arrhythmia, recent MI (≤ 6 months), stroke (≤ 6 months), or significant VTE (≤ 6 months).\n   * Neurologic conditions, including prior optic neuritis, CNS inflammatory diseases, or seizure disorders.\n   * History of malignancy, unless resected/treated with curative intent or in remission for ≥ 3 years.\n   * Uncontrolled systemic infections or active CNS lymphoma.\n4. Pregnancy & Breastfeeding: Females who are pregnant or nursing.\n5. Other Considerations:\n\n   * Investigator-determined safety concerns.\n   * Potential noncompliance with study procedures.",
