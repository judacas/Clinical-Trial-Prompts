Participants with previously treated brain metastases may participate if they are clinically stable for at least 4 weeks with no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases. There must be no need for immunosuppressive doses of glucocorticoids for at least 2 weeks prior to study treatment administration.\n* There is a mean resting QTcF > 470 ms on triplicate electrocardiograms.\n* There is active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years. The following autoimmune conditions are permitted: Type 1 diabetes, hypothyroidism (on hormone replacement), or- vitiligo, psoriasis and alopecia as long as no systemic treatment is required.\n* There is either chronic treatment with systemic steroids, other immunosuppressive medication, or either of these has been administered within 14 days of start of study treatment.\n* Note: Participants with asthma that require intermittent use of bronchodilators, inhaled steroids, or local steroid injections are eligible.
