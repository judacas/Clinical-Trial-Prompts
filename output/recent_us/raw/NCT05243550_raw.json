    "exclusion_criteria": "* Participants with sensitising EGFR mutations or ALK translocations.\n* Participants with baseline PD-L1 expression status <1% (Arms 6 and 7 only).\n* Active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders.\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness, uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina pectoris, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, active bleeding diseases, serious chronic gastrointestinal conditions associated with diarrhoea, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirement.\n* History of another primary malignancy.\n* Participants with small-cell lung cancer or mixed small-cell lung cancer.\n* History of active primary immunodeficiency.\n* History of non-infectious interstitial lung disease (ILD) ILD/pneumonitis that required steroids, has current ILD/pneumonitis, or has suspected ILD/pneumonitis that cannot be ruled out by imaging at screening.\n* Participants who have preoperative radiotherapy treatment as part of their care plan.\n* Participants who require or may require pneumonectomy, segmentectomies, or wedge resections, as assessed by their surgeon at baseline, to obtain potentially curative resection of primary tumour.\n* QTcF (QT interval corrected by Fridericia's formula) interval ≥ 470 ms.\n* Any medical contraindication to treatment with chemotherapy as listed in the local labelling.\n* Participants with moderate or severe cardiovascular disease.\n* Any concurrent chemotherapy, investigational product, biologic, or hormonal therapy for cancer treatment.\n* Receipt of live attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of study interventions.\n* Prior exposure to approved or investigational immune-mediated therapy including, but not limited to, other anti-CTLA-4, anti-TIGIT (T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains), anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, and anti-PD-L2 antibodies. Participants who received agents targeting the adenosine pathway, anti-NKG2A, anti-HLA-E agents, and anti-LIF agents are also excluded. Participants who have received previous treatment with a TROP2 targeting ADC or with another ADC containing a chemotherapy agent that inhibits TOP1 activity are also excluded.\n* Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 14 days before the first dose of study interventions.\n* Active or uncontrolled infections including HBA, HBV, HCV, and HIV.",
