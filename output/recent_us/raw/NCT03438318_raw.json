    "official_title": "A Single-Center Phase 1/2 Study of Single- or Fractioned-Dose Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin in Combination With G-CSF, Cladribine, Cytarabine, and Mitoxantrone for Previously Untreated Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia or High-Grade Myeloid Neoplasm",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Diagnosis of untreated \"high-grade\" myeloid neoplasm (≥ 10% blasts in blood or bone marrow) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) other than acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) with t(15;17)(q22;q12) or variants according to the 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) classification; outside diagnostic material is acceptable to establish diagnosis; submission of peripheral blood specimen for flow cytometry performed at the study institution should be considered; diagnostic material must have been submitted for cytogenetic and/or molecular testing as clinically appropriate\n* Medically fit, as defined by treatment-related mortality (TRM) score ≤13.1 calculated with simplified model\n* The use of hydroxyurea prior to study registration is allowed; patients with symptoms/signs of hyperleukocytosis or white blood cells (WBC) > 100,000/uL can be treated with leukapheresis or may receive up to 2 doses of cytarabine (up to 500 mg/m^2/dose) prior to enrollment\n* Patients may have received low-intensity treatment (e.g. azacitidine/decitabine, lenalidomide, growth factors) for antecedent low-grade myeloid neoplasm (i.e. < 10% blasts in blood and bone marrow)\n* Bilirubin ≤ 2.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (IULN) unless elevation is thought to be due to hepatic infiltration by AML, Gilbert's syndrome, or hemolysis (assessed within 14 days prior to study day 0)\n* Serum creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dL (assessed within 14 days prior to study day 0)\n* Left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 45%, assessed within 12 months prior to study day 0, e.g. by multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan or echocardiography, or other appropriate diagnostic modality and no clinical evidence of congestive heart failure\n* Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception\n* Provide written informed consent\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Myeloid blast crisis of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), unless patient is not considered candidate for tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment\n* Concomitant illness associated with a likely survival of < 1 year\n* Active systemic fungal, bacterial, viral, or other infection, unless disease is under treatment with anti-microbials, and/or controlled or stable (e.g. if specific, effective therapy is not available/feasible or desired [e.g. known chronic viral hepatitis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)]); patient needs to be clinically stable as defined as being afebrile and hemodynamically stable for 24 hours; patients with fever thought to be likely secondary to leukemia are eligible\n* Known hypersensitivity to any study drug\n* Confirmed or suspected pregnancy or active breast feeding\n* Treatment with any other investigational anti-leukemia agent; in phase 2, treatment with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor for patients with FLT3-mutated AML is permissible",
