Patients with a malignancy that is either relapsed/refractory to standard therapy or for which no standard therapy is available.\n4. Patients with a malignancy that is currently not amenable to surgical intervention due to either medical contraindications or non-resectability of the tumor.\n5. Patients with measurable or non-measurable disease according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumor (RECIST, v1.1).\n6. Patients with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0 or 1 (see APPENDIX B: Performance Status Evaluation).\n7. Life expectancy of greater than or equal to 3 months.\n8. Resolution of all chemotherapy-related or radiation-related toxicities to Grade 1 severity or lower, except for stable sensory neuropathy (less than or equal to Grade 2).\n9. Patients who are either not of childbearing potential or who agree to use a medically effective method of contraception during the study and during 3 months after the last dose of study drug. (See Appendix H: Forms of contraception).\n10. Patients with the ability to understand and give written informed consent for participation in this trial, including all evaluations and procedures as specified by this protocol.\n\nDose expansion Cohort - TNBC\n\n1. Patients with conditions as follows:\n\n   * ER <10%, PR <10% by IHC assay; And\n   * HER2 negative based on ASCO CAP guideline\n2.

Relapsed (recurrence or disease progression after achieving a documented clinical response to first- or second-line treatment) or refractory (disease progression while receiving first line or second line treatment). In the case of TNBC, prior initial therapy with at least one known active regimen for TNBC including, but not limited to, any combination of anthracyclines, taxanes, platinum agents, Ixabepilone, and/or cyclophosphamide is required.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion Cohorts Patients meeting any of the following criteria are ineligible for participation in the study.\n\n1.

Patients with known central nervous system (CNS) or leptomeningeal metastases not controlled by prior surgery, radiotherapy or requiring corticosteroids to control symptoms, or patients with symptoms suggesting CNS involvement for which treatment is required.\n3. Patients with primary brain tumors.\n4. Patients with any hematologic malignancy. This includes leukemia (any form), lymphoma, and multiple myeloma.\n5. Patients with any of the following hematologic abnormalities at baseline. (Patients may have received a red blood cell product transfusion prior to study, if clinically warranted.):\n\n   * Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) < 1,500 per mm3\n   * Platelet count < 100,000 per mm3\n   * Hemoglobin < 8.0 gm/dL\n6. Patients with any of the following serum chemistry abnormalities at baseline:\n\n   * Total bilirubin ≥ 1.5 × the ULN for the institution value\n   * AST or ALT ≥ 3 × the ULN for the institution value (≥ 5 × if due to hepatic involvement by tumor)\n   * Creatinine ≥ 1.5 × ULN for the institution value (or a calculated creatinine clearance < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2* )\n7. Patients with a significant active cardiovascular disease or condition, including:\n\n   * Congestive heart failure (CHF)requiring therapy\n   * Need for antiarrhythmic medical therapy for a ventricular arrhythmia\n   * Severe conduction disturbance\n   * Unstable angina pectoris requiring therapy\n   * QTc interval > 450 msec (males) or > 470 msec (females)\n   * QTc interval ≤ 300 msec\n   * History of congenital long QT syndrome or congenital short QT syndrome\n   * LVEF < 50% as measured by echocardiography or MUGA scan\n   * Uncontrolled hypertension (per the Investigator's discretion)\n   * Class III or IV cardiovascular disease according to the New York Heart Association's (NYHA) Functional Criteria (see APPENDIX C: New York Heart Association's Functional Criteria).\n   * Myocardial infarction (MI) within 6 months prior to first study drug administration\n8.

Patients with any other serious/active/uncontrolled infection, any infection requiring parenteral antibiotics, or unexplained fever > 38ºC within 1 week prior to first study drug administration.\n11. Patients with inadequate recovery from any prior surgical procedure, or patients having undergone any major surgical procedure within 4 weeks prior to first study drug administration.\n12. Patients with any other life-threatening illness, significant organ system dysfunction, or clinically significant laboratory abnormality, which, in the opinion of the Investigator, would either compromise the patient's safety or interfere with evaluation of the safety of the study drug.\n13. Patients with a psychiatric disorder or altered mental status that would preclude understanding of the informed consent process and/or completion of the necessary studies.\n14. Patients with the inability or with foreseeable incapacity, in the opinion of the Investigator, to comply with the protocol requirements.\n15.
