These herbal medications include but are not limited to St. John's wort, kava, ephedra (mahung), gingko biloba, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), yohimbe, saw palmetto and ginseng. Patients should stop using herbal medications 7 days prior to the first dose of study treatment.\n4. Brain metastases or spinal cord compression unless asymptomatic and not requiring steroids for at least 14 days prior to start of study treatment.\n5.

Active interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis or a prior history of ILD/pneumonitis requiring treatment with steroids.\n7. Patients receiving any concurrent chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, or biologic, or hormonal therapy for cancer.\n\n   * Concurrent use of hormones for noncancer-related conditions (e.g., insulin for diabetes and hormone replacement therapy) is acceptable. The dose of systemic corticosteroids must not exceed 10 mg of prednisone equivalent.\n   * Patients in Part A and Part D with radically-treated prostate cancer may continue androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).\n8. Patients must have completed any previous cancer-related treatments before enrolment. The following intervals between the end of the prior treatment and first dose of study drug must be observed:\n\n   * Port-a-cath placement: no waiting is required\n   * Minor surgical procedures (as defined by the Medical Monitor): 7 postoperative days\n   * Major surgery (as defined by the Medical Monitor): ≥4 weeks\n   * Radiotherapy: ≥4 weeks (patients who receive palliative radiation for nontarget tumour lesions need not be subjected to this washout period and can be enrolled immediately)\n   * Chemotherapy: ≥ 21 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) from the first dose of study drug\n   * Immunotherapy and/or anticancer therapy with agents including mAbs ≥4 weeks\n   * Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 14 days before first dose of durvalumab The following are exceptions to this criterion:\n\n     * Use of intranasal, inhaled, topical corticosteroids, local steroid injections (e.g., intra articular injections)\n     * Systemic corticosteroids at physiologic doses below 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent is permitted\n     * Steroids as premedication for hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., CT scan premedication) are permitted\n9.

Inadequate organ and marrow function as demonstrated by any of the following laboratory values. Transfusions intended to elevate any parameters below solely for the intent of meeting study eligibility are not permitted.\n\n    * Leukocytes <3.0 x 10(exp 9)/L\n    * Absolute neutrophil count <1.5 x 10(exp 9)/L\n    * Platelet count <100 x 10(exp 9)/L\n    * Haemoglobin <90 g/L\n    * Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) >2.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) if no demonstrable liver metastases or >5 times ULN in the presence of liver metastases\n    * Total bilirubin >1.5 times ULN if no liver metastases or 3 times ULN in the presence of liver metastases or documented Gilbert's Syndrome (unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia)\n    * Creatinine outside normal limits OR, if creatinine outside normal limits, a creatinine clearance <60 mL/min (measured by 24-hour urine collection or calculated by Cockcroft and Gault equation (Cockcroft and Gault 1976).\n16.

Suffers from a comorbidity that in the opinion of the Investigator or Medical Monitor renders the patient unsuitable for participation in the study. Such comorbidity may include, but is not limited to, uncontrolled intercurrent illness such as active infection, severe active peptic ulcer disease or gastritis, myocardial infarction within 6 months before entry, congestive heart failure, symptomatic congestive heart failure, active cardiomyopathy, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, uncontrolled hypertension, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n18. As judged by the Investigator, has any evidence of severe or uncontrolled diseases, or has an active viral infection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human papilloma virus (HPV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and/or hepatitis C virus (HCV)].\n19. Active infection including tuberculosis (clinical evaluation that included clinical history, physical examination and radiographic findings, and tuberculosis testing in line with local practice).\n20.
