    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Adults ≥18 years of age\n2. Patient has a life expectancy ≥ 3 month\n3. Patient has relapsed or refractory disease Relapsed lymphoma: Relapsed lymphoma is disease that has responded to treatment but then returns.\n\n   Refractory lymphoma: Failure to achieve complete response at the end of therapy or progression within 6 months from completion of therapy\n4. Included Diseases\n\n   * DLBCL, including transformed lymphoma\n   * Mantle Cell Lymphoma\n   * PTCL\n   * CTCL\n   * CLL/SLL\n   * Follicular lymphoma\n   * Marginal zone lymphoma\n   * Hodgkin lymphoma (both classical and lymphocyte predominant)\n   * Waldenströms Macroglobulinemia\n5. Must has failed or is not a candidate for available therapies with reasonable likelihood of clinical benefit, which includes FDA approved products and standard of care regimens\n6. Therapy means at least three front lines of therapy including Hematopoeitic Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT and/or Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cells, when applicable\n7. Females must be of non-childbearing potential, surgically sterile, postmenopausal, or practice adequate methods of contraception during the study\n8. Males must agree to use an adequate method of contraception during the study\n9. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance score of 0, 1, or 2\n10. Adequate hepatic and renal functions as defined by:\n\n    * Aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) ≤2.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN); and\n    * Total bilirubin ≤1.5 times ULN; and\n    * Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of at least 50ml/min. These estimations can be calculated using the following methods:\n\n      * Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-Epi) equation\n      * Cockcroft Gault equation\n      * Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD study equation)\n      * Creatinine clearance estimated by 24-hr urine collection for creatinine clearance\n11. Recovered from the effects of any prior surgery, radiotherapy, or antineoplastic treatment (with the exception of alopecia), based on Investigator assessment\n12. Willing and able to provide written informed consent\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Active non-hematologic malignancy other than lymphoid malignancies treated with immuno- or chemotherapy within the previous 12 months except active non-melanoma, non-invasive skin cancer will be allowed\n2.

Serious intercurrent medical or psychiatric illness which, in the opinion of the Investigator, would interfere with the ability of the participant to complete the study\n11. Active hepatitis B infection (based on positive surface antigen [HBsAg]), hepatitis C infection (based on Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) positive antibody [HCV Ab]), or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1 or HIV-2, based on positive antibody)\n12. Presence of concurrent conditions that, in the opinion of the Investigator and/or Medical Monitor, may compromise or interfere with any aspect of study conduct or interpretation of results. This includes, but is not limited to, unstable or uncontrolled angina, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV congestive heart failure, uncontrolled and sustained hypertension, clinically significant cardiac dysrhythmia or clinically significant baseline EKG abnormality (e.g., QTcF >470 msec)\n13.
