    "official_title": "Navigation Endoscopy to Reach Indeterminate Lung Nodules Versus Trans-Thoracic Needle Aspiration, a Randomized Controlled Study (VERITAS)",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Patient is referred for biopsy of a single indeterminate pulmonary nodule, with the following characteristics regarding size, location, accessibility, and probability of malignancy:\n\n  * Intermediate pre-test probability of malignancy as defined by a pre-test probability of malignancy between 10% and 100%, using a validated clinical prediction model, which is either:\n\n    * The Brock model14 if no PET scan data are available, or\n    * The Herder model15 if PET-CT data are available.\n  * Size between 10 and 30 mm (long diameter).\n  * Location peripheral, here defined as occupying the middle or outer third lung zones.\n  * Accessible via navigation bronchoscopy and also accessible via CT-guided biopsy (i.e. the nodule is clinically suited to equal access by either procedure), as confirmed by an independent interventional panel.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Patients with proximal nodules, as defined by nodules present in the proximal 1/3 of the lung by dedicated software analysis (described below) will not be eligible for the study.\n* Patients with multiple nodules requiring biopsy (patients may have other nodules not considered for biopsy).",
