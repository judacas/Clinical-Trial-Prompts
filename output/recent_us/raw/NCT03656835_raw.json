    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Newly pathologically proven diagnosis of stage IIIA/B/C (per AJCC 8) NSCLC\n2. Age at least 18 years.\n3. Availability of a representative tumor specimen that is suitable for BOTH determination of PD-L1 status via local testing and, independently, other required correlative study biomarkers. Tissue submission should include:\n\n   1. A representative FFPE tumor specimen in a paraffin block, along with an associated pathology report, which will be sent to the biorepository. If institutional policy prevents the submission of a block, refer to the Correlative Science Manual (CSM) for alternative submission instructions.\n   2. If archival tumor tissue is unavailable or is determined to be unsuitable for required testing, tumor tissue must be obtained from a biopsy performed at screening. Questions about biopsy adequacy should be directed to the study team.\n   3. Patients may still be eligible after these two points (3a and 3b) have been attempted/considered, at the discretion of the AFT Study Team.\n4. No active autoimmune disease or uncontrolled infection\n5. FEV1 ≥ 1.2L or > 40% predictive\n6. No underlying heart or lung disease precluding treatment per protocol.\n7. Measurable (RECIST v1.1) stage IIIA, IIIB or IIIC disease per AJCC 8.\n8. Patients must be considered unresectable or inoperable. Patients who decline surgery for stage III NSCLC are also eligible. Patients with nodal recurrence after surgery for early-stage NSCLC are eligible if the following criteria are met:\n\n   * No prior systemic therapy or radiation for this lung cancer\n   * Prior curative-intent surgery at least 3 months prior to the nodal recurrence Note: Patients may be medically unfit for surgery, (e.g., due to general anesthesia risk), but remain fit for chemoradiotherapy. Thus, the criterion does not necessarily have to exclude all patients who are medically unfit for surgery.\n9. Stage III A/B/C disease (per AJCC 8) with minimum diagnostic evaluation to include:\n\n   * History/physical examination within 4 weeks\n   * Contrast enhanced CT of the chest including upper abdomen (or CT without contrast if contrast is medically contraindicated) within 4 weeks\n   * MRI of the brain with contrast (or CT with contrast if MRI is medically contraindicated) within 6 weeks\n   * PET/CT skull to thigh within 6 weeks If pleural fluid is visible on CT scan, thoracentesis to exclude malignancy should be obtained unless the effusion is too small to tap in which case the patient is eligible.\n10. Patients must be at least 4 weeks from major surgery and must be fully recovered.\n11. Adequate hematologic and end organ function, defined by the following laboratory results obtained within 14 days prior to the first study treatment (Cycle 1, Day 1); if repeat labs are obtained on or prior to C1D1 they must re-meet eligibility criteria to treat):\n\n    * ANC ≥ 1500 cells/µL\n    * WBC counts > 2500/ µ L\n    * Lymphocyte count ≥ 500/ µ L\n    * Platelet count ≥ 100,000/ µ L\n    * Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL (patients may be transfused to meet this criterion).\n    * Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 ⋅ upper limit of normal (ULN) with the following exception:\n    * Patients with known Gilbert disease who have serum bilirubin level ≤ 3 ⋅ ULN may be enrolled.\n    * AST, ALT and Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 ⋅ ULN\n    * Serum albumin ≥ 25 g/L (2.5 g/dL)\n    * For patients not receiving therapeutic anticoagulation: INR and aPTT ≤ 1.5 ⋅ ULN\n    * For patients receiving therapeutic anticoagulation: stable anticoagulant regimen\n    * Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 ⋅ ULN or creatinine clearance ≥ 45 mL/min on the basis of the Cockcroft-Gault glomerular filtration rate estimation:\n    * (140 - age) ⋅ (weight in kg) ⋅ (0.85 if female) 72 ⋅ (serum creatinine in mg/dL)\n12. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 or 1.\n13. Negative HIV test at screening with the following exception: patients with a positive HIV test at screening are eligible provided they are stable on anti-retroviral therapy, have a CD4+ T-cell count > 200/vL, and have an undetectable viral load.\n14. Negative hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) test at screening\n15. Positive hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb) test at screening, or negative HBsAb at screening accompanied by either of the following:\n\n    * Negative total hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb)\n    * Positive total HBcAb test followed by quantitative hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA < 500 IU/mL\n    * The HBV DNA test will be performed only for patients who have a negative HBsAg test, a negative HBsAb test, and a positive total HBcAb test.\n16. Negative hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody test at screening, or positive HCV antibody test followed by a negative HCV RNA test at screening. The HCV RNA test will be performed only for patients who have a positive HCV antibody test.\n17. Non-pregnant and non-nursing. The effect of atezolizumab and tiragolumab on the fetus is unknown.\n18. For women of childbearing potential: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use contraception, and agreement to refrain from donating eggs, as defined below:\n\n    * Women must remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive methods with a failure rate of < 1% per year during the treatment period and for 90 days after the final dose of tiragolumab, 5 months after the final dose of atezolizumab, and 6 months after the final dose of paclitaxel, pemetrexed, gemcitabine, carboplatin or cisplatin. Women must refrain from donating eggs during this same period.\n    * A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarchal, has not reached a postmenopausal state (≥ 12 continuous months of amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause), and is not permanently infertile due to surgery (i.e., removal of ovaries, fallopian tubes, and/or uterus) or another cause as determined by the investigator (e.g., Müllerian agenesis). The definition of childbearing potential may be adapted for alignment with local guidelines or regulations.\n    * Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of < 1% per year include bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, hormonal contraceptives that inhibit ovulation, hormone-releasing intrauterine devices, and copper intrauterine devices.\n    * The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not adequate methods of contraception. If required per local guidelines or regulations, locally recognized adequate methods of contraception and information about the reliability of abstinence will be described in the local Informed Consent Form.\n    * Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must be willing to use 2 methods of birth control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course of the study through 6 months after the last dose of study medication. Patients of childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not been free of menses > 1 year.\n\n    Women who would like to become pregnant after study treatment discontinuation should seek advice on oocyte cryopreservation prior to initiation of study treatment because of the possibility of irreversible infertility due to treatment with carboplatin.\n19. For men: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use a condom, and agreement to refrain from donating sperm, as defined below:\n\n    * With a female partner of childbearing potential, men who are not surgically sterile must remain abstinent or use a condom plus an additional contraceptive method that together result in a failure rate of < 1% per year during the treatment period, for 90 days after the final dose of tiragolumab, and for 6 months after the final dose of paclitaxel and/or carboplatin. Men must refrain from donating sperm during this same period.\n    * With a pregnant female partner, men must remain abstinent or use a condom during the treatment period for 90 days after the final dose of tiragolumab, and for 6 months after the final dose of paclitaxel or carboplatin to avoid exposing the embryo.\n    * The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not adequate methods of contraception. If required per local guidelines or regulations, locally recognized adequate methods of contraception and information about the reliability of abstinence will be described in the local Informed Consent Form.\n    * Male patients must agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting with the first dose of study therapy through 6 months after the last dose of study therapy Men who would like to father a child after study treatment initiation should be advised regarding the conservation of sperm prior to treatment because of the possibility of irreversible infertility resulting from chemotherapies used in this study.\n20.
