Must be PD-L1 high (TPS ≥ 50%), with no EGFR or ALK aberrations\n5. Anti-PD1 naïve urothelial carcinoma\n\n   1. Must be PDL1 positive (CPS of ≥ 10), or ineligible for any platinum-containing chemotherapy regardless of PDL1 status; or\n   2. Had disease progression within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Prior treatment with an investigational anti-LAG3 therapy.\n2. Treatment with any CTLA4 antibody within 16 weeks of the start of study drug for Cohorts 1M, 2M, 3M, 1P, and 2P; within 8 weeks for Cohorts 4M, 5M, 3P, 4P and 4Pi; and within 3 weeks for Cohorts 6M, 7Mi, 7M, 5P, and 6P.\n3. Systemic antineoplastic therapy, unconjugated antibody therapy within 4 weeks of the first dose of study treatment; or radiotherapy within 2 weeks of the first dose of study treatment; or small molecule kinase inhibitors within 6 elimination half-lives of the first dose of study treatment.\n4. Have received prior therapy with an anti-PD1, anti-PDL1, or anti PDL2 agent or with an agent directed to another stimulatory or co-inhibitory T-cell receptor (eg, CTLA4, OX 40, CD137) AND were permanently discontinued from that treatment due to an irAE.\n5. Failure to recover from any irAE from prior cancer therapy to Grade ≤ 1.\n6. Failure to recover from any other toxicity (other than immune-related toxicity) related to previous anticancer treatment to Grade ≤ 2.\n7. Active known or suspected autoimmune disease (except that subjects are permitted to enroll if they have vitiligo; type 1 diabetes mellitus; residual hypothyroidism due to an autoimmune condition that is treatable with hormone replacement therapy only; psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, or another autoimmune skin condition that is managed without systemic therapy; or arthritis that is managed without systemic therapy beyond oral acetaminophen and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs).\n8. Receipt of an organ allograft.\n9. Treatment with antibiotics within 14 days prior to first dose of study drug.\n10. Participants with known HIV.\n11.
