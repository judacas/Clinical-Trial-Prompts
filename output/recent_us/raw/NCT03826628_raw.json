Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) below 3.0×the upper limit of normal (ULN) (or ALT and AST ≤5×ULN if liver metastases are present).\n    7. Total serum bilirubin <1.5×ULN; or total bilirubin ≤3.0×ULN with direct bilirubin within normal range of the central laboratory in participants with well documented Gilbert's Syndrome.\n11. Have baseline corrected QT (QTc) interval <470 msec.\n12. Are able to swallow oral medications.\n13. Have a life expectancy of at least 12 weeks\n14. Sex and Contraceptive/Barrier Requirements\n\n    a) Are postmenopausal, defined as: i) Patient's last menstrual period occurred more than 12 months prior to screening without any alternative medical cause, and ii) Patient's postmenopausal status is confirmed by screening serum follicle-stimulating hormone concentration of >40 milli-International unit/ml (mIU/mL); or iii) Patient has undergone surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy and/or hysterectomy) OR b) Must have a negative pregnancy test at screening and upon study entry (Cycle 1 Day 1) if not postmenopausal and c) Contraceptive use must be consistent with local regulations regarding the methods of contraception for those participating in clinical studies if not postmenopausal.\n\n    Patients under 55 years with intact ovaries will undergo hormonal verification.\n15.
