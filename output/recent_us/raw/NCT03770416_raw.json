systemic immunostimulatory agents (including, but not limited to, interferon and IL-2) within 4 weeks or 5 drug-elimination half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to starting the study therapy.\n* History of prior treatment with TIGIT-directed treatment agents or other types of immunotherapies (e.g., prior treatment with CD137 agonists or investigational immune checkpoint blockade therapies,

azathioprine, methotrexate, thalidomide, and antitumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-alpha] agents) within 2 weeks prior to starting the study therapy, or anticipation of a need for systemic immunosuppressive medication during study therapy, with the following exceptions:\n\n  --acute, low-dose systemic immunosuppressant medication (< 10 mg of prednisone daily) or a one-time pulse dose of systemic immunosuppressant medication (e.g., 48 hours of corticosteroids for a contrast allergy).\n* Treatment with therapeutic oral or IV antibiotics within 2 weeks prior to starting the study
