    "official_title": "A Phase 2 Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Efficacy of the Infusion of Autologous CD34+ Cells Transduced With a Lentiviral Vector Carrying the FANCA Gene in Pediatric Subjects With Fanconi Anemia Subtype A",
    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Fanconi anemia as diagnosed by chromosomal fragility assay of cultured lymphocytes in the presence of DEB or a similar DNA-crosslinking agent\n2. Subject of the complementation group FA-A\n3. Minimum age: 1 year and a minimum weight of 8 kg\n4. At least 30 CD34+ cells/μL are determined in one bone marrow (BM) aspiration within 3 months prior to CD34+ cell collection OR\n\n6. Provide informed consent in accordance with current legislation 7. Women of childbearing age must have a negative urine pregnancy test at the baseline visit, and accept the use of an effective contraception method during participation in the trial\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 1 Year",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Subjects with an available and medically eligible HLA-identical sibling donor.\n2. Evidence of myelodysplastic syndrome or leukemia, or cytogenetic abnormalities other than those reported as variant(s) of normal in BM aspirate analysis. This assessment should be made by valid studies conducted within the 3 months before the subject commences the stem cell mobilization/collection procedures of the clinical trial.\n3. Subjects with somatic mosaicism associated with stable or improved counts in all PB cell lineages. (If T-lymphocyte chromosomal fragility analysis indicates potential mosaicism, a medically significant decrease (≥1 NCI CTCAE grade) in at least one blood lineage over time must be documented to enable eligibility, as should <5% resistance of bone marrow colony forming cells (CFCs) to 10nM MMC; whenever possible potential mosaicism should also be evaluated by gene sequencing of MMC-resistant CFCs).\n4. Lansky performance status ≤60%.\n5. Any concomitant disease or condition that, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator, renders the subject unfit to participate in the study.\n6. Pre-existing sensory or motor impairment ≥grade 2 according to the criteria of the NCI.\n7. Pregnant or breastfeeding women.\n8. Hepatic dysfunction as defined by either:\n\n   * Bilirubin >3.0 × the upper limit of normal (ULN) or\n   * Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) > 5.0 × ULN or\n   * Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) > 5.0 × ULN\n\n   For subjects with bilirubin, ALT or AST above ULN, a workup to identify the etiology of liver abnormality should be conducted prior to confirmation of eligibility as stipulated in exclusion criterion 5, including evaluation of viral hepatitis, iron overload, drug injury or other causes.\n9. Renal dysfunction requiring either hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.\n10. Pulmonary dysfunction as defined by either:\n\n    * Need for supplemental oxygen during the prior 2 weeks in absence of acute infection or\n    * Oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry <90%.\n11. Evidence of active metastatic or locoregionally advanced malignancy for which survival is anticipated to be less than 3 years.\n12. Subject is receiving androgens (i.e. danazol, oxymetholone).\n13. Subject is receiving other investigational therapy for treatment/prevention of FA-associated bone marrow failure.",
