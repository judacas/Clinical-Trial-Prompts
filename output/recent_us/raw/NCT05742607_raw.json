Male subjects must agree to refrain from sperm donation from initial study treatment administration through at least 6 months after the last dose of study treatment.\n* Subject must have a white blood cell count ≤ 25 × 10^9/L. (Note: subjects who have undergone hydroxyurea administration or leukapheresis for therapeutic cytoreduction will be considered eligible).\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Subject has ECOG Performance Status > 3, regardless of age.\n* Subject has known Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection (due to potential drug-drug interactions between antiretroviral medications and venetoclax). HIV testing will be performed at Pretreatment, if required per local guidelines or institutional standards.\n* Subject has consumed grapefruit, grapefruit products, Seville oranges (including marmalade containing Seville oranges) or Star fruit within 3 days prior to the initiation of study treatment.",
