Subjects with severe hepatic impairment may have medical findings consistent with their hepatic dysfunction as determined by medical history, physical examination, 12-lead ECG, vital sign measurements, and clinical laboratory evaluations at screening and check-in (Day -1), as assessed by the Investigator, provided that the followings are satisfied:\n\n    * Non-hepatic impairment-related, abnormal clinical laboratory evaluations must not be clinically relevant, as judged by the Investigator and approved by the study assigned medical monitor.\n    * Values outside the normal ranges for liver function tests are acceptable as consistent with the subject's hepatic condition, provided they are stable for at least 1 month prior to screening, as judged by the Investigator and approved by the study assigned medical monitor.\n    * Subjects may enter with non-clinically significant Grade 1 anemia per CTCAE version 5.0, i.e. with Hb > 10 mg/dL.\n    * Subjects must have a platelet count ≥ 35 × 109 /L\n12. Subjects with stable, mild, chronic concurrent diseases, such as degenerative joint disease, hypertension or hyperlipidaemia, etc. may be included. Subjects with diabetes mellitus may be included, provided the subjects have:\n\n    * Glycosylated hemoglobin A1c values ≤ 9.5% at screening; eligibility in case of outside values should be evaluated by the study assigned medical monitor on a case-by-case basis.\n    * Blood glucose values ≤ 240 mg/dL at screening and check-in (Day -1) while on subjects' normal diabetes medication.\n13. Currently on a stable medication regimen, defined as not starting new drug(s) or changing drug dose(s) within 28 days of administration of study drug (Day 1). Concomitant medications administered within 28 days prior to administration of study drug (Day 1) must be approved by the Investigator and the study assigned medical monitor.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
