    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Voluntary written consent must be given before performance of any study related procedure not part of standard medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn by the subject at any time without prejudice to future medical care.\n2. Male or female subjects ≥18 years.\n3. Patients must be eligible for high-dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation as per institutional guidelines.\n4. No prior multiple myeloma (MM) -directed therapy except for dexamethasone (up to 160 mg), bortezomib (up to 5.2 mg/m^2) and/or cyclophosphamide up to 500 mg/m^2 administered for management of acute manifestations of MM (hypercalcemia, renal impairment, pain) for no longer than four weeks prior to enrollment. If subject received any prior therapy, pretreatment parameters necessary for disease characterization and response assessment (at least one of the following: Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP)/Immunofixation electrophoresis (IFE), 24-hour urine protein with urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP)/ IFE, serum free light chains and bone marrow procedure) must be available.\n5. Patients must have documented multiple myeloma as defined by the criteria below (a, b, and c):\n\n   1. Monoclonal plasma cells in the bone marrow of ≥10% or presence of a biopsy proven plasmacytoma AND\n   2. Evidence of organ damage or myeloma-defining events (MDE) that can be attributed to the underlying proliferative plasma cell disorder (at least one of the following):\n\n      • Hypercalcemia: corrected serum calcium >1 mg/dL higher than the upper limit of normal (ULN) or >11 mg/Dl.\n\n      OR\n\n      • Anemia: hemoglobin value of >2.0 g/dL below the lower limit of normal, or a hemoglobin value <10.0 g/dL.\n\n      OR\n      * Bone marrow plasma cells of >60%. OR\n      * Involved/uninvolved light chain ratio ≥100 OR\n      * Renal insufficiency: eGFR < 40 mL/min/1.73m^2 (based on the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease MDRD formula). [Cohort A subjects must meet this criterion.] If the patient is enrolled in the renal impaired (RI) A cohort but Cycle 1 Day 1 labs do not meet RI definition, the patient will be considered RI (reconsent and rescreening are not required).\n   3. Measurable disease as defined (at least one of the following):\n\n      * Serum M-protein level ≥0.5 g/dL; OR\n      * Urine M-protein level ≥200 mg/24 hours; OR\n      * Light chain multiple myeloma without measurable disease in the urine: serum immunoglobulin (Ig) free light chains (FLC) ≥10 mg/dL and abnormal serum Ig kappa/lambda FLC ratio.\n6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2.\n7. Female subjects who:\n\n   1. Are postmenopausal for at least one year before the screening visit, OR\n   2. Are surgically sterile, OR\n   3. Females of childbearing potential or male subjects with female partners of childbearing potential shall be required to use effective contraceptive methods (double barrier method, intrauterine device, oral contraception or abstinence) starting two weeks before first study drug(s) administration, while on therapy and for 16 weeks following the last dose of study drug(s). A woman is considered of childbearing potential, i.e., fertile, following menarche and until becoming postmenopausal unless permanently sterile. The following highly effective methods of contraception are accepted:\n\n      * Established use of oral, intravaginal, or transdermal combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation.\n      * Established use of oral, injectable, or implantable progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation.\n      * Placement of an intrauterine device or intrauterine hormone-releasing system.\n      * Barrier methods of contraception: male condom with either cap, diaphragm or sponge with spermicide (double-barrier methods). The use of double-barrier methods should always be supplemented with the use of a spermicide. Female condom and male condom should not be used together.\n      * Male sterilization (provided that the partner is the sole sexual partner of the patient and that the sterilized partner has received medical assessment of the surgical success).\n      * Sexual abstinence.\n      * Female subjects must agree not to donate eggs (ova, oocytes) for the purposes of assisted reproduction starting two weeks before first study drug(s) administration, while on therapy and for 16 weeks following the last dose of study drug(s).\n8. Male subjects, even if surgically sterilized (i.e., status postvasectomy), who:\n\n   1. Agree to practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study treatment period from the time of signing the informed consent through and through four months after the last dose of study drug(s) (female and male condoms should not be used together), or\n   2. Agree to practice true abstinence during the entire study treatment period from the time of signing the informed consent through 16 weeks after the last dose of study drug(s), when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. (Periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods for the female partner] withdrawal, spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea are not acceptable methods of contraception.)\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. For renal impaired Cohort A subjects, any subject who requires immediate treatment for management of renal failure (including, but not limited to, dialysis). Such treatment is allowed once the patient becomes stable, based on investigator's discretion.\n2.

Known or suspected of not being able to comply with the study protocol (e.g., because of alcoholism, drug dependency, or psychological disorder) or the subject has any condition for which, in the opinion of the investigator, participation would not be in the best interest of the subject (e.g., compromise their well-being) or that could prevent, limit, or confound the protocol-specified assessments.\n11. Pregnant or breastfeeding or planning to become pregnant starting two weeks before first study drug(s) administration, while on therapy and for 16 weeks following the last dose of study drug(s).\n12.
