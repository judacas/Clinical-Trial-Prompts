In individuals who have never had a liver biopsy, a screening liver biopsy may be performed.\n* Screening laboratory parameters as determined by the study central laboratory:\n\n  * Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73m^2, as calculated by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation.\n  * HbA1c ≤ 10%\n  * International normalized ratio (INR) ≤ 1.4, unless due to therapeutic anticoagulation\n  * Platelet count ≥ 125,000/uL\n  * Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) < 5 x ULN\n  * Serum albumin ≥ 3.5 g/dL\n  * Serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) ≤ 2 x ULN\n* Body mass index (BMI) ≥ 23 kg/m^2 at screening.\n\nKey\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 80 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Prior history of decompensated liver disease, including ascites, hepatic encephalopathy (HE), or variceal bleeding.\n* Child-Pugh (CP) score > 6 at screening, unless due to an alternative etiology such as Gilbert's syndrome or therapeutic anticoagulation.\n* Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score > 12 at screening, unless due to an alternative etiology such as therapeutic anticoagulation.\n* Other causes of liver disease based on medical history and/or central reader review of liver histology, including but not limited to: alcoholic liver disease, autoimmune disorders (eg, primary biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, autoimmune hepatitis), drug-induced hepatotoxicity, Wilson disease, clinically significant iron overload, or alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency.\n* Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (HBsAg positive), or Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (HCV antibody and HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) positive). Individuals cured of HCV infection less than 2 years prior to the screening visit are not eligible.\n* History of liver transplantation.\n* Current or prior history of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).\n* Men who habitually drink greater than 21 units/week of alcohol or women who habitually drink greater than 14 units/week of alcohol (1 unit is equivalent to 12 ounce (oz)/360 mL of beer, a 4 oz/120 mL glass of wine, or 1 oz/30 mL of hard liquor).\n\n  * For individuals on vitamin E regimen ≥ 800 IU/day, or pioglitazone, dose must be stable, in the opinion of the investigator for at least 180 days prior to the historical or screening liver biopsy.\n  * For individuals on medications for diabetes, dose must be stable, in the opinion of the investigator, for at least 90 days prior to the historical or screening liver biopsy.\n* History of type 1 diabetes.\n* Treatment with a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) in the period from 90 days prior to the screening visit and for individuals with a qualifying historical liver biopsy, for 90 days prior to the date of the historical liver biopsy.\n* For individuals who have not completed a series of an authorized coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination regimen prior to screening, a positive result for COVID-19 on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test.\n\nNote: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.",
