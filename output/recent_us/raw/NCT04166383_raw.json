    "exclusion_criteria": "* Participate in more than 90 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous aerobic exercise per week over the past month. This study targets insufficiently active persons to assess the effect of the described exercise intervention, where additional exercise done regularly will contaminate the intervention effects.\n* Unstable comorbidities that prevent participation in moderate-to-vigorous intensity exercise. Patients with unstable comorbidities may develop unexpected adverse events from exercise. For the purpose of patients' safety, as well as because this study involves remote, home-based exercise where close supervision is not possible, patients with unstable medical conditions are excluded.\n* Subjects who in the opinion of the investigator may not be able to comply with the safety monitoring requirements of the study.",
