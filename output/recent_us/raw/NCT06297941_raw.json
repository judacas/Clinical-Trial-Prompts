    "exclusion_criteria": "* Any of the following because this study involves an agent that has known genotoxic, mutagenic and teratogenic effects:\n\n  * Pregnant persons\n  * Nursing persons\n  * Persons of childbearing potential who are unwilling to employ adequate contraception\n* Histology other than high grade serous carcinoma\n* Prior treatment restrictions\n\n  * Chemotherapy =< 4 weeks prior to registration\n  * Immunotherapy =< 4 weeks prior to registration\n  * Radiotherapy =< 4 weeks prior to registration\n  * Any other investigational therapy =< 4 weeks prior to registration\n* History of prior or concurrent malignancy =< 2 years prior to registration\n\n  * Exceptions: If natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to:\n\n  * Myocardial infarction within 6 months of study entry\n  * New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV heart failure\n  * Uncontrolled dysrhythmias or poorly controlled angina\n  * History of serious ventricular arrhythmia (ventricular tachycardia [VT] or ventricular fibrillation [VF]) and/or factors that predispose to arrhythmia (e.g., heart failure, hypokalemia, family history of long QT syndrome)\n* Known history or current symptoms of cardiac disease, or history of treatment with cardiotoxic agents, Exception: Patients should have a clinical risk assessment of cardiac function using the New York Heart Association functional classification. To be eligible for this trial, patients should be class IIB or better Exception: Patients who have received prior doxorubicin (Doxil) are eligible if asymptomatic with QTc =< 480msec (Fridericia) and NYHA class IIB or better\n* Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Exception: Patients on effective anti-retroviral therapy with undetectable viral load =< 6 months prior to registration are eligible for this trial\n* Known hepatitis\n\n  * Exception: For patients with evidence of chronic hepatitis B virus infection the HepB viral load must be undetectable on suppressive therapy, if indicated, to be eligible\n  * Exception: Patients with a history of hepatitis C virus infection must have been treated and cured. Patients with HCV infection who are currently on treatment are eligible if they have an undetectable HCV viral load\n* Receiving any other investigational agent\n* History of clinically significant gastrointestinal bleeding, colitis, or gastrointestinal perforation\n* Co-morbid systemic illnesses or other severe concurrent disease which, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study or interfere significantly with the proper assessment of safety and toxicity of the prescribed regimens\n* Requirement for anticoagulation treatment that increases international normalized ratio (INR) or activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) above the normal range (Exceptions: low dose deep vein thrombosis [DVT] or line prophylaxis allowed)\n* Known central nervous system (CNS) disease Exception: Patients with treated brain metastases are eligible if follow-up brain imaging after CNS directed therapy shows no evidence of progression. Patients with new or progressive brain metastases (active brain metastases) or leptomeningeal disease are eligible if the treating physician determined that immediate CNS specific treatment is not required and is unlikely to be required during the 1st cycle of therapy\n* Known Gilbert's syndrome or homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 variant allele or other relevant alleles with severely reduced UGT1A1 activity\n* Patients who require treatment with UGT1A1 inhibitors during the planned period of investigational treatment with PLX038",
