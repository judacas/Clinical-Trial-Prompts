tumor markers: must be IGCCC good risk; post op: alpha-FP < 1,000 ng/mL, beta-HCG < 5,000 IU/mL and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) < 3.0 x normal; age (years) >= 11 and < 25\n  * Site: extragonadal; stage: COG stage II; histology: must contain at least one of the following: yolk sac tumor, embryonal carcinoma, or choriocarcinoma; age (years) >= 11 and < 25\n* Notes:\n\n  * IGCCC criteria only apply to SR2 patients with a testicular primary tumor\n  * Use post-op tumor marker levels to determine IGCCC risk group\n  * Stage 1 seminoma patients are not eligible for the standard risk arms of the study\n  * For the low risk stage I non-seminoma MGCT and the standard risk arms, components of yolk sac tumor, embryonal carcinoma, or choriocarcinoma can be mixed with other forms of GCT, such as seminoma or mature or immature teratoma; if yolk sac tumor is the only malignant component present, then it must be deemed by the pathologist to be greater than a \"microscopic component\" of yolk sac tumor\n* Patients must have a performance status corresponding to Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scores of 0, 1, 2 or 3; use Karnofsky for patients > 16 years of age and Lansky for patients =< 16 years of age\n* Organ function requirements apply ONLY to patients who will receive chemotherapy (SR1 and SR2 patients)\n* Adequate renal function defined as:\n* Creatinine clearance or radioisotope glomerular filtration rate (GFR) >= 70 mL/min/1.73 m^2 (within 7 days prior to enrollment) OR\n* A serum creatinine based on age/gender as follows (within 7 days prior to enrollment): (mg/dL)\n\n  * 1 month to < 6 months male: 0.4 female: 0.4\n  * 6 months to < 1 year male: 0.5 female: 0.5\n  * 1 to < 2 years male: 0.6 female: 0.6\n  * 2 to < 6 years male: 0.8 female: 0.8\n  * 6 to < 10 years male: 1 female: 1\n  * 10 to < 13 years male: 1.2 female: 1.2\n  * 13 to < 16 years: male: 1.5 female: 1.4\n  * >= 16 years male: 1.7 female: 1.4\n* Total bilirubin =< 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) for age (within 7 days prior to enrollment)\n* Serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) (aspartate aminotransferase [AST]) or serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) (alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) < 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) for age (for the purpose of this study, the ULN for SGPT is 45 U/L) (within 7 days prior to enrollment)\n* Peripheral absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >= 1,000/mm^3 (within 7 days prior to enrollment) AND\n* Platelet count >= 100,000/mm^3 (within 7 days prior to enrollment)\n* Patients enrolling on the standard risk arms must be medically fit to receive protocol treatment and with no contraindications to protocol treatment\n* Eligibility criteria to participate in the pilot study of the AYA-Hears instrument (patient reported outcomes [PROs] of ototoxicity) Note: participants in group 1 will not receive AGCT1531 protocol-directed therapy;
