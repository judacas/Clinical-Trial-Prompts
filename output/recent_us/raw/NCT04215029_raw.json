    "official_title": "A Phase I Study to Assess Safety of Selective JAK 1 Inhibitor, Itacitinib, in Patients with Bronchiolitis Obliterans Syndrome (BOS) After Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplant (HCT)",
    "inclusion_criteria": "Healthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 75 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Prior treatment with any other JAK inhibitor (including Ruxolitinib) for BOS or any other indication within the past 6 months of enrolment.\n2. Patients on mechanical ventilation or resting by pulse oximetry O2 saturation <88%\n3. FEV1 <40% predicted\n4. Relapsed primary malignancy for which SCT was performed\n5. History of progressive multifocal leuko-encephalopathy (PML)\n6. Active uncontrolled bacterial, fungal, parasitic, or viral infection\n7. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or active hepatitis B or C infections.\n8. History of tuberculosis anytime after SCT\n9. Severe renal dysfunction defined by serum creatinine > 2 mg/dL, creatinine clearance <60 mL/minute or dialysis dependence\n10. Serum transaminases > 5 × upper limit of normal\n11. inability to perform PFT reliably\n12. Positive Beta HCG test in a woman with child bearing potential defined as not post-menopausal for 12 months or no previous surgical sterilization.\n13. Lactating/nursing women\n14. Life expectancy < 6 months\n15. Other severe organ dysfunction unrelated to underlying GVHD. For example, uncontrolled or significant cardiac disease, including any of the following: recent myocardial infarction (within last 6 months from randomization); New York Heart Association Class III or IV congestive heart failure; unstable angina (within last 6 months prior to randomization); clinically significant (symptomatic) cardiac arrhythmias (e.g., sustained ventricular; tachycardia, and clinically significant second or third degree AV block without a pacemaker); uncontrolled hypertension. Or any other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions which, in the opinion of the investigator, could compromise participation in the study, pose a significant risk to the subject, or interfere with study results.",
    "miscellaneous_criteria": "Inclusion criteria:\n\n1. BOS diagnosed within the past 6 months of enrollment, defined by 2015 National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Criteria 126\n2. Age 18-75 years\n3. Undergone allogeneic SCT\n4. ANC >1,000/µL, hemoglobin > 8 gm/dL (untransfused) and platelet count >25,000/ µL (untransfused)\n5. Karnofsky performance score >60\n6. The ability to understand and sign a written informed consent form\n7. Contraception for women and men of child bearing potential. Permitted methods should be at least 99% effective in preventing pregnancy.\n8. Male patients must be willing to refrain from donating sperm during their participation in the study and for at least 3 months after completing the study."
