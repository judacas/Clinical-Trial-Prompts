Requirement of more than 2 bleach baths per week during study participation.\n18.

Presence of skin comorbidities that may interfere with study assessments.\n20. Have a clinically significant history or evidence of any active or suspected parasitic infection (other than treated trichomoniasis) within the 4 weeks before Randomization or has travelled within the past 3 months of Randomization to areas of high parasitic exposure (based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] travel notice alert Level 2 and warning Level 3).\n21.
