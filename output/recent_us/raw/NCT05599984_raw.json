    "inclusion_criteria": "* STEP 1 (RANDOMIZATION) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n* Patient must be >= 18 years of age.\n* Patient must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2 at the time of step 1 randomization.\n* Patient must have histologically proven pure or mixed urothelial cancer of the bladder.\n\n  * NOTE: Small cell carcinoma is excluded, however other variant histologies are permitted provided a component of urothelial carcinoma is present.\n* Patient must have documented node-positive and non-metastatic disease (any T, any N, M0). Node positivity must have been defined prior to receiving any systemic chemotherapy or induction chemotherapy.\n\nNode positivity can fall into either of the following categories and will be defined by imaging and/or biopsy:\n\n* A lymph node >= 1.0 cm in short axis on imaging (i.e., CT or MRI or positron emission tomography [PET]/CT).\n* A lymph node that is < 1 cm on imaging with either a biopsy confirming involvement with cancer or high suspicion of cancer.\n\n  * For patients who have received induction chemotherapy (any type of systemic chemotherapy) for node positive bladder cancer prior to enrollment, there must be no signs of disease progression (CR/partial response [PR] or stable disease [SD]) based on restaging imaging and cystoscopy, which consists of:\n* CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis obtained after completion of induction chemotherapy and within 8 weeks prior to step 1 randomization.\n\n  * NOTE: MRI can be used instead of CT per treating physician discretion.\n* Cystoscopic evaluation and attempt to perform maximal transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) performed by the participating urologist after completion of induction chemotherapy and within 12 weeks prior to step 1 randomization. If maximal TURBT is not possible for medical reasons, the enrollment must be discussed and approved with the study chair. Documentation of correspondences with the study chair must be kept on file.\n* Patients who achieve CR upon cystoscopy per urologist with no visible tumor (i.e., no need for additional TURBT), are allowed to proceed in the study as adequate resection with no residual disease in bladder.\n\n  * For patients who have did not receive induction chemotherapy (any type of systemic chemotherapy) for node positive bladder cancer prior to enrollment, the following must be obtained:\n* CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis completed within 8 weeks prior to step 1 randomization.\n\n  * NOTE: MRI can be used instead of CT per treating physician discretion.\n* Cystoscopic evaluation and attempt to perform maximal TURBT performed by the participating urologist within 12 weeks prior to step 1 randomization. If maximal TURBT is not possible for medical reasons, the enrollment must be discussed and approved with the study chair. Documentation of correspondences with the study chair must be kept on file.\n* For patients who may need repeat TURBT if their old TURBT has fallen out of window: If urologist determine no visible tumor (i.e., no need for additional resection) upon cystoscopy, they are allowed to proceed in the study as complete resection.\n\n  * Patient must not have received any previous radiation therapy to the pelvic area.\n  * Patient must agree to undergo CT simulation and treatment planning. If this is the first case registered at the site, then a pre-treatment radiation therapy (RT) review will be required and will take up to 3 business days. The patient cannot start radiation treatment prior to successful completion of this pre-treatment review. Therefore, careful planning is necessary to meet the deadline of starting radiation within 20 business days of step 1 randomization.\n  * Patient must not have presence of concomitant active upper tract tumors or urethra tumors. History of previously adequately treated non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) are eligible. Previously treated urothelial cancer or histological variant at any site outside of the urinary bladder are allowed, provided they have been Ta/T1/carcinoma in situ (CIS) and post treatment follow up imaging and endoscopic evaluation shows no evidence of disease.\n  * Patients with previous exposure to immune checkpoint inhibitor for non-muscle invasive disease are eligible. If given for NMIBC, the last dose must have been completed > 12 months prior to step 1 randomization.\n  * Patient must not be pregnant or breast-feeding due to the potential harm to an unborn fetus and possible risk for adverse events in nursing infants with the treatment regimens being used.\n\nAll patients of childbearing potential must have a blood test or urine study within 14 days prior to step 1 randomization to rule out pregnancy.\n\nA patient of childbearing potential is defined as any patient, regardless of sexual orientation or whether they have undergone tubal ligation, who meets the following criteria: 1) has achieved menarche at some point, 2) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 3) has not been naturally postmenopausal (amenorrhea following cancer therapy does not rule out childbearing potential) for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months).\n\n* Patients must not expect to conceive or father children by using accepted and effected method(s) of contraception or by abstaining from sexual intercourse from the time of step 1 randomization for the duration of their participation in the study and continue for at least 3 months after the last dose of protocol treatment.\n* Leukocytes >= 3,000/mcL (obtained < 14 days prior to step 1 randomization).\n* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >= 1,500/mcL (obtained < 14 days prior to step 1 randomization).\n* Hemoglobin >= 9 g/dL (obtained < 14 days prior to step 1 randomization).\n* Platelets >= 100,000/mcL (obtained < 14 days prior to step 1 randomization).\n* Total bilirubin =< 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) (obtained < 14 days prior to step 1 randomization).\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT]) =< 2.5 x institutional ULN (obtained < 14 days prior to step 1 randomization).\n* Adequate renal function as evidenced by calculated (Cockcroft's formula) creatinine clearance or 24 hours actual creatinine clearance >= 30mL/min. The creatinine used to calculate the clearance result must have been obtained within 14 days prior to step 1 randomization.

Patients with history of completely resolved childhood asthma or atopy are not excluded. Patients with asthma not requiring more than 10 mg/d or equivalent of prednisone are not excluded. Patients with well-controlled hypothyroidism on thyroxine replacement will be eligible as well. Patients with known history of hypoadrenalism on maintenance steroids will be eligible. Patients with type I diabetes mellitus will be eligible, provided their disease is well controlled.
