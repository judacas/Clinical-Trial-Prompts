BCR is defined as the presence of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) greater than 0.2 ng/mL measured 6 to 13 weeks after radical prostatectomy followed by a confirmatory test showing persistent PSA greater than 0.2 ng/mL; or \"PSA nadir + 2 ng/mL\" (treated with radiation therapy); or PSA doubling time < 6 months without radiographic evidence of recurrence 3.Patients with a Screening testosterone level >1.5 ng/ml; 4.Patients with a life expectancy of at least 12 months; 5.Patients with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of ≤2; 6.Patient understands and is willing to comply with the protocol and related procedures; 7.If having female sexual partners of childbearing potential, agree to avoid the occurrence of pregnancy during study participation and for 130 days after completing the study by using a highly effective method of contraception such as barrier method and female contraceptives, including spermicides, etc.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be MALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1.

Patients who have previously received hormonal therapy for prostate cancer, including surgical deprivation or sex hormone-regulating agents such as GnRH agonists/inhibitors as well as estrogen therapy. However, patients previously treated with neo-adjuvant therapy or adjuvant hormonal therapy for less than 6 months with an interval of at least 6 months since discontinuation of such therapy at the time of the Screening Visit can be enrolled;\n3. Any patient at risk of urinary tract obstruction or spinal cord compression due to potential testosterone surge;\n4.
