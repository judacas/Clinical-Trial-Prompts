    "inclusion_criteria": "* Males and females >=18 years of age\n* Histologically or cytologically confirmed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), performed on a biopsy that occurred within the last 90 days. This biopsy can be deferred if the procedure is deemed to represent an unacceptable safety risk to the patient by the Principal Investigator and as long as the patient has a prior biopsy showing non-small cell lung cancer.\n* Documented activating EGFR mutation (Exon 19 deletion, T790M, or L858R) on tumor samples by Clinical Laboratory Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-approved test\n* Patients treated with osimertinib or another EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) (including erlotinib, afatinib, gefitinib, & rocelitinib) are eligible if they received no more than 28 days of treatment, and if there is no evidence of grade 2 or greater treatment adverse events possibly related to treatment with the EGFR TKI.\n* Positron emission tomography (PET)-computed tomography (CT) within the last 60 days showing radiographic stage I to IIIa lung cancer (mediastinal staging biopsy is allowed but not required)\n* Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (or CT if contraindication to MRI) within the last 60 days showing no evidence of metastatic disease\n* Documentation that the patient is a candidate for surgical resection of their lung cancer by an American Board of Thoracic Surgery certified surgeon\n* The patient must have a tumor size >=1 centimeter (cm) in its longest diameter.\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS) of 0-1\n* Any unresolved toxicities from prior therapy greater than Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade 1 at the time of starting study treatment, with the exception of alopecia and grade 2 prior platinumtherapy-related neuropathy is allowed\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) =< 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN)\n* Bilirubin =< 1.5 x ULN, (Patients with documented Gilbert's syndrome and conjugated bilirubin within the normal range may be allowed into the study; in this event, it will be documented that the patient was eligible based on conjugated bilirubin levels)\n* Potassium and magnesium within normal range, patients may receive supplements to meet this requirement\n* Leukocytes > 3,000/microliter (mcL)\n* Hemoglobin >= 9 g/dL, with no blood transfusions in the 28 days prior to study entry\n* Absolute neutrophil count > 1,500/mcL\n* Platelets > 100,000/mcL\n* Creatinine Clearance (CrCl) > 50 mL/min for patients with serum creatinine (SCr) > 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN)\n* Ability to swallow oral medications\n* Women of childbearing potential (WoCBP) must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 3 days prior to the first dose of study treatment and agree to use highly effective contraception, during the study and for 90 days following the last dose of osimertinib\n\n  * Women of childbearing potential (WoCBP): women between menarche and menopause who have not been permanently or surgically sterilized and are capable of procreation\n  * Women NOT of childbearing potential: women who are permanently or surgically sterilized or postmenopausal\n\n    * Permanent sterilization includes hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy and/or bilateral salpingectomy but excludes bilateral tubal occlusion; tubal occlusion is considered a highly effective method of birth control but does not absolutely exclude possibility of pregnancy; (the term occlusion refers to both occluding and ligating techniques that do not physically remove the oviducts)\n  * Women who have undergone tubal occlusion should be managed on trials as if they are of WoCBP (e.g. undergo pregnancy testing etc., as required by the study protocol)\n  * Women will be considered postmenopausal if they are amenorrhoeic for 12 months without an alternative medical cause; the following age-specific requirements apply:\n\n    * Women under 50 years old will be considered postmenopausal if they have been amenorrhoeic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal treatments and with luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone levels in the postmenopausal range\n    * Women over 50 years of age will be considered postmenopausal if they have been amenorrhoeic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments\n  * Acceptable contraception methods are:\n\n    * Total sexual abstinence (abstinence must be for the total duration of the trial and the follow-up period)\n    * Vasectomized sexual partner plus male condom (with participant assurance that partner received post-vasectomy confirmation of azoospermia)\n    * Tubal occlusion plus male condom\n    * Intra-uterine device - provided coils are copper-banded, plus male condom\n    * Intra-uterine system (IUS) levonorgestrel IUS (e.g., Mirena), plus male condom\n    * Medroxyprogesterone injections (Depo-Provera) plus male condom\n    * Etonogestrel implants (e.g., Implanon, Norplan) plus male condom\n    * Normal and low dose combined oral contraceptive pills, plus male condom\n    * Norelgestromin / ethinylestradiol transdermal system plus male condom\n    * Intravaginal device (e.g., ethinylestradiol and etonogestrel) plus male condom\n    * Cerazette (desogestrel) plus male condom (Cerazette is currently the only highly efficacious progesterone based pill)\n  * Unacceptable Contraception Methods The following methods are considered not to be highly effective and are therefore not acceptable contraceptive methods:\n\n    * Triphasic combined oral contraceptives\n    * All progesterone only pills except, Cerazette\n    * All barrier methods, if intended to be used alone\n    * Non-copper containing intra-uterine devices\n    * Fertility awareness methods\n    * Coitus interruptus\n* Men with a female partner of childbearing potential must have either had a prior vasectomy agree to use effective contraception as described in the full protocol for at least 14 days prior to administration of the first dose of study treatment, during the study, and for 90 days following the last dose of osimertinib\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
