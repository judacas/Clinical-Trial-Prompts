    "official_title": "MATCH Treatment Subprotocol Z1I: Phase II Study of AZD1775 in Patients With Tumors Containing BRCA1 and BRCA2 Mutations",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Patients must have met applicable eligibility criteria in the Master MATCH Protocol prior to registration to treatment subprotocol\n* Patients must have mutation in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene in the tumor, or another aberration, as determined via the MATCH Master Protocol. Patients with tumor carrying mutations defined as variants of uncertain significance will not qualify\n* Patients with ovarian cancer or HER2 negative, metastatic breast cancer must have received a PARP inhibitor as part of or as one of their prior lines of therapy\n* Patients must have an electrocardiogram (ECG) within 8 weeks prior to treatment assignment and must have no clinically important abnormalities in rhythm, conduction or morphology of resting ECG (e.g. complete left bundle branch block, third degree heart block)\n* Patients receiving any medications or substances that are inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4, or CYP3A4 substrates need to be reviewed by the study investigator. Continuation of such medications will be at the discretion of the study investigator. Concomitant use of aprepitant and fosaprepitant is prohibited\n* Patients have hemoglobin (HgB) >= 9 g/dL, which should be done =< 4 weeks prior to registration to treatment step\n* Resting corrected QTc interval using the Fridericia formula (QTcF) should be < 450 msec/male and < 470 msec/female (as calculated per institutional standards) obtained from electrocardiogram (ECG), prior to enrollment. If resting QTc interval using the Fridericia formula (QTcF) is > 450 msec/male and > 470 msec/female (as calculated per institutional standards), then 2 additional ECGs should be performed 2-5 minutes apart at study entry. In order to be eligible, the mean resting corrected QTc interval using the Fridericia formula (QTcF) should be < 450 msec/male and < 470 msec/female (as calculated per institutional standards)\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Patients must not have known hypersensitivity to AZD1775 or compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition",
