Patient must have hormone receptor positive (HR+) endometrial cancer confirmed by MSK pathology:\n\n     * To fulfill the requirement for HR+ disease, tumor must express by immunohistochemistry (IHC), at least 1 of the hormone receptors (estrogen receptor [ER] or progesterone receptor [PgR] as defined in the relevant American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)/College of American Pathologists (CAP) guidelines (Hammond et al, 2010)\n* Any prior therapy directed at the malignant tumor, including immunologic agents and radiotherapy, must be discontinued prior to first study treatment.\n\n  * Patients who received chemotherapy must have recovered (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] Grade ≤1) from the acute effects of chemotherapy except for residual alopecia or Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy prior to randomization. A washout period of at least 21 days is required between last chemotherapy dose and randomization (provided the patient did not receive radiotherapy).\n  * Patients who received radiotherapy must have completed and fully recovered from the acute effects of radiotherapy. A washout period of at least 14 days is required between end of radiotherapy and randomization.\n* Adequate hematologic and end organ function, defined by the following laboratory results obtained within 7 days prior to first study treatment:\n\n  * Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1500/109dL\n  * Platelet count ≥ 100,000/109dL\n  * Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL\n  * Albumin ≥ 3.0 g/dL\n  * Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x the upper limit of normal (ULN)\n  * AST and ALT ≤ 3.0x ULN\n* International normalized ratio (INR) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) ≤ 1.5 xULN. For patients requiring therapeutic anticoagulation, a stable INR ≤3 x ULN is required.\n* Are able to swallow capsules/tablets\n* Are willing to follow study procedures\n* For patients of childbearing potential, agreement to use two effective forms of contraception (e.g., surgical sterilization, a reliable barrier method, birth control pills, or contraceptive hormone implants) and to continue its use for the duration of the study and for 30 days after the last abemaciclib dose.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be FEMALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",

Visceral crisis is not the mere presence of visceral metastases but implies severe organ dysfunction as assessed by symptoms and signs, laboratory studies, and rapid progression of disease.\n* Patients who have received prior treatment with fulvestrant, everolimus, temsirolimus, ridaforolimus or another mTor inhibitor, or any CDK4 and CDK6 inhibitor.\n* Patients who have received an autologous or allogenic stem-cell transplant.\n* Clinically significant history of liver disease, including cirrhosis and current alcohol abuse.\n* Patients who have active systemic bacterial infection (requiring intravenous [IV] antibiotics at time of initiating study treatment), fungal infection, or detectable viral infection\n* Presence of positive test results for hepatitis B (hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAGg] and/or total HB core antibody [anti-HBc]) or hepatitis C (hepatitis C virus [HCV] antibody serology testing)\n* Patients positive for anti-HBc are eligible only if also positive for HB surface antibody (anti-HBs) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay is negative for HBV DNA.\n\n  * Patients positive for HCV antibody are eligible only if testing for HCV RNA is negative.\n* Known HIV infection.\n* Active autoimmune disease that is not controlled by nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs.\n* Pregnancy, lactation, breastfeeding.\n* Current severe, uncontrolled systemic disease (e.g., clinically significant cardiovascular, pulmonary, or metabolic disease)\n* Major surgical procedure within 14 days prior to randomization, or significant traumatic injury within 28 days prior to Day 1 or anticipation of the need for major surgery during the course of study treatment.\n* Have initiated biphosphonate or RANK ligand targeted agents (for example,denosumab) <7 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1\n* Uncontrolled hypomagnesemia or hypokalemia, defined as values below the lower limit of normal despite optimal electrolyte supplementation or management\n* Leptomeningeal disease as a manifestation of cancer\n* Known untreated or active central nervous system (CNS) metastases (progression or requiring anticonvulsants or corticosteroids for symptomatic control).
