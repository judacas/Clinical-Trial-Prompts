    "official_title": "CHARM II: Chemotherapy for Ablation and Resolution of Mucinous Pancreatic Cysts: a Prospective, Randomized, Double-blind, Multi-center Clinical Trial",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Adult subjects over the age of 18.\n* Patients with a previously-detected pancreatic cyst(s) 2-5 cm in diameter which is consistent with a mucinous type cyst as per ASGE guidelines, including indeterminate type cysts.\n* Able to give written informed consent.\n* Capable of safely undergoing endoscopy with deep sedation or general anesthesia.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Lesions which are consistent with a benign cyst by clinical, cytological, chemical, and radiographic evaluation as per ASGE guidelines (i.e., consistent with a pseudocyst or serous cystadenoma).\n* Known or suspected pancreatic cancer or pathologic lymphadenopathy.\n* Cysts with the following high-risk features: main pancreatic duct dilation of > 5mm, epithelial type mural nodules (> 2mm)33, pathologically thick wall/septation (> 2mm), cytology showing high grade dysplasia or \"suspicious for malignancy\", signs of common bile duct or pancreatic duct obstruction, solid mass component within or associated with the cyst (> 2mm), pancreatic duct stricture associated with tail atrophy, or previous fine needle aspiration failure due to excessive cyst fluid viscosity. (Of note, the following higher-risk features ARE eligible: recent growth in size, atypical cells on cytology, and symptoms referable to the pancreas.)\n* Septated cysts with > 4 compartments.\n* Confirmed acute pancreatitis within the last 6 months.\n* Baseline lab values (must be within 6 months of consent date) in the following ranges: white blood cells > 14 or < 2 K/uL, hematocrit <30%, platelets <30 K/uL, non-pharmacologic INR >1.7, CA19-9 >2x ULN, lipase >2x ULN, creatinine >3.0 mg/dl (unless stable on renal replacement therapy), ALT >500 U/L, total bilirubin >2.5 mg/dl.\n* Any pre-existing or discovered medical condition that would, at the discretion of the investigator, interfere with the completion of and/or participation in the existing protocol. This includes severe pre-existing medical conditions which would preclude a reasonable 5 year life expectancy (and thus neutralize the patient's benefit from ablating a premalignant type pancreatic cyst).\n* Pregnancy, breastfeeding, or incarcerated individual.",
