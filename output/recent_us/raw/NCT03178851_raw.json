    "official_title": "A Single-Arm, Open-Label, Phase II Study of Systemic and Tumor Directed Therapy for Recurrent Oligometastatic M1 Prostate Cancer",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Confirmed diagnosis of prostate adenocarcinoma after radical prostatectomy (primary small cell carcinoma of the prostate is not allowed, however adenocarcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation is allowed)\n* Presence of 1-5 visible metastases (by PSMA PET-CT)\n\n  * At least one metastasis must be M1a-b\n  * Visceral metastases are not allowed\n  * Patients may have any number of pelvic nodal metastases (but largest must be < 2 cm)\n  * Metastases must be amenable to treatment with SBRT\n  * Biopsy of one metastasis must be attempted, unless unsafe to perform\n* Patient must be fit to undergo SBRT to all visible sites of metastases, ADT\n* Total testosterone > 150 ng/dL prior to ADT (optimal time to measure total testosterone is between 8 and 9 am)\n* Adequate performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] 0-1)\n* Hemoglobin >= 9.0 g/dL, independent of transfusion and/or growth factors within 3 months prior to randomization\n* Platelet count >= 100,000 x 10^9/uL independent of transfusion and/or growth factors within 3 months prior to randomization\n* Serum albumin >= 3.0 g/dL\n* Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) >= 45 mL/min\n* Serum potassium >= 3.5 mmol/L\n* Serum total bilirubin =< 1.5 x upper limits of normal (ULN)\n\n  * Note: In subjects with Gilbert?s syndrome, if total bilirubin is > 1.5 x ULN, measure direct and indirect bilirubin and if direct bilirubin is =< 1.5 x ULN, subject may be eligible\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) < 2.5 x ULN\n* Medications known to lower the seizure threshold must be discontinued or substituted at least 4 weeks prior to study entry\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be MALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Any evidence of spinal cord compression (radiological or clinical)\n* Prior pelvic malignancy\n* Prior pelvic radiation aside from salvage prostate radiation\n* Concurrent malignancy aside from superficial skin cancers or superficial bladder tumors\n* Inability to undergo radiotherapy, or ADT\n* Primary small cell carcinoma of the prostate (prostate adenocarcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation is allowed)\n* Inflammatory bowel disease or active collagen vascular disease\n* History of any of the following:\n\n  * Seizure or known condition that may pre-dispose to seizure (e.g. prior stroke within 1 year to randomization, brain arteriovenous malformation, Schwannoma, meningioma, or other benign central nervous system [CNS] or meningeal disease which may require treatment with surgery or radiation therapy)\n  * Severe or unstable angina, myocardial infarction, symptomatic congestive heart failure, arterial or venous thromboembolic events (eg, pulmonary embolism, cerebrovascular accident including transient ischemic attacks), or clinically significant ventricular arrhythmias within 6 months prior to randomization\n* Current evidence of any of the following:\n\n  * Uncontrolled hypertension\n  * Gastrointestinal disorder affecting absorption\n  * Active infection (eg, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] or viral hepatitis)\n  * Any chronic medical condition requiring a higher dose of corticosteroid than 10 mg prednisone/prednisolone once daily\n  * Any condition that in the opinion of the investigator would preclude participation in this study\n  * Concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducers. (If a strong CYP3A4 inducer must be co-administered, abiraterone acetate dose frequency will be adjusted). [SAFETY: Warning against use with CYP2C8 inhibitors with narrow therapeutic index is also pertinent to be included as it is also part of United States Prescribing Information (USPI): In a CYP2C8 drug-drug interaction trial in healthy subjects, the area under curve (AUC) of pioglitazone (CYP2C8 substrate) was increased by 46% when pioglitazone was given together with a single dose of 1,000 mg abiraterone acetate. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for signs of toxicity related to a CYP2C8 substrate with a narrow therapeutic index if used concomitantly with ZYTIGA]\n  * Treatment with CYP2D6 substrates that have a narrow therapeutic index. If an alternative treatment cannot be used, a dose reduction of the CYP2D6 substrate may be considered\n  * Baseline moderate and severe hepatic impairment (ChildPugh Class B & C)\n* Presence of visceral metastases (i.e., stage M1c)",
