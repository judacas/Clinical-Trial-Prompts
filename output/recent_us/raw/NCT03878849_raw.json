Men who have partners of childbearing potential must agree to use an effective contraceptive method during the study and for 6 months following the last dose of study drug\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Major surgery within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study drugs\n2. Uncontrolled active systemic infection\n3. Known positive serology for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\n4. Active hepatitis B infection (defined as the presence of detectable HBV DNA, HBe antigen or HBs antigen). Patients with serologic evidence of prior vaccination (HBsAg negative, anti-HBs antibody positive, anti-HBc antibody negative) are eligible. Patients who are HBsAg negative/HBsAb positive but HBcAb positive are eligible, provided HBV DNA is negative and they are willing to take appropriate anti-viral prophylaxis\n5. Active hepatitis C infection (defined as detectable hepatitis C RNA in plasma by PCR)\n6. Known active cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. Unknown or negative status are eligible\n7. Active, uncontrolled autoimmune phenomenon (autoimmune hemolytic anemia or immune thrombocytopenia) requiring steroid therapy with > 20 mg daily of prednisone or equivalent or for which new therapy was introduced or existing therapy was escalated within the 4 weeks prior to study enrollment to maintain adequate blood counts\n8. Clinically significant, uncontrolled cardiovascular disease (≥3 NYHA heart failure, uncontrolled or symptomatic arrythmias), or myocardial infarction within 6 months, or stroke within 6 months, or intracranial bleeding within 6 months prior to start of study drugs\n9. Prolongation of the QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTcF) > 470 msec. Note: Patients with QTcF > 470 msec should have EKG repeated. If QTcF again is > 470 msec, then the patient should be referred to cardiology for evaluation. Patient can be enrolled later if cleared by cardiology and repeat QTcF less than 470 msec. QTcF is calculated using Fridericia's Formula (QTcF): QTcF = QT/(RR0.33) a. Correction of suspected drug-induced QTcF prolongation can be attempted at the investigator's discretion and only if clinically safe to do so with either discontinuation of the offending drug or switch to another drug not known to be associated with QTcF prolongation.\n\n   b. Correction for underlying bundle branch block (BBB) allowed. Note: Patients with pacemakers are eligible if they have no history of fainting or clinically relevant arrhythmias while using the pacemaker\n10. Pregnancy, lactation or plan to breastfeed during the study or within 6 months of the last dose of study treatment\n11. Concurrent use of warfarin or another vitamin K antagonist\n12. Current treatment with strong cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors or inducers. A washout period of at least 5 half-lives of these agents following discontinuation and prior to study entry is required (treatment with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers is not excluded)\n\n    a. Because of their effect on CYP3A4, use of any of the following within 7 days of study therapy start or planned use during study participation is prohibited\n\n    i. Grapefruit or grapefruit products\n\nii. Seville oranges or products from Seville oranges\n\niii. Star fruit 13. Current treatment with the following P-gp inhibitors: amiodarone, clarithromycin, cyclosporine, erythromycin, ketoconazole, and verapamil. A washout period of at least 5 half-lives of the inhibitor before study entry is required.\n\n14. Known central nervous system involvement by CLL/SLL/RT 15. Active second malignancy unless in remission and with life expectancy > 2 years with exception of patients diagnosed with basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma \"in situ\" of the cervix or breast who are eligible even if diagnosed within 2 years. If patients have another malignancy that was treated within the last 2 years, such patients may be enrolled, if the likelihood of requiring systemic therapy for this other malignancy within 2 years is less than 10%, as determined by an expert in that particular malignancy at MD Anderson Cancer Center, and after consultation with the Principal Investigator.\n\n16. Prior therapy restrictions\n\na. Cohort 1 (CLL/SLL)\n\ni. Prior receipt of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody therapy for non-malignant indication, including for autoimmune phenomenon ii. Prior receipt of systemic therapy for CLL/SLL\n\nb. Cohort 2 (RT)\n\ni. Patients who experienced a major bleeding event or grade ≥3 arrythmia on prior treatment with a BTK inhibitor ii. History of allogeneic or autologous stem cell transplant (SCT) or chimeric antigen receptor-modified T cell (CAR-T) therapy within 60 days of first dose of study drugs or presence of any of the following, regardless of prior SCT and/or CAR-T therapy timing:\n\n1.

Patients are required to have the following washout periods prior to planned Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1). In addition, prior treatment-related AEs must have recovered to Grade ≤ 1 with the exception of alopecia and Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy.\n\n1. Targeted agents, investigational agents, therapeutic monoclonal antibodies or cytotoxic chemotherapy: 5 half-lives or 2 weeks, whichever is shorter\n\n1. Immunoconjugated antibody treatment within 10 weeks prior to randomization\n2. Broad field radiation (≥ 30% of the bone marrow or whole brain radiotherapy) must be completed 14 days prior to study enrollment\n3. Palliative limited field radiation must be completed 7 days prior to study enrollment.\n\n   iv. Prior therapy with venetoclax and obinutuzumab is allowed but Richter should not have developed while actively receiving venetoclax or obinutuzumab (active therapy implies having received venetoclax or obinutuzumab within the prior 3 months)\n\n   17.
