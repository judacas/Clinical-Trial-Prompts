    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Prior treatment with HER3 targeted therapy.\n2.

Has a history of (non-infectious) ILD/pneumonitis and/or radiation pneumonitis that required steroids, has current ILD/pneumonitis and/or radiation pneumonitis, or where suspected ILD/pneumonitis and/or radiation pneumonitis cannot be ruled out by imaging at screening.\n9. Have a lung-specific intercurrent clinically significant illness including, but not limited to, any underlying pulmonary disorder (e.g., pulmonary emboli within 3 months prior to Cycle 1 Day 1, severe asthma, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, restrictive lung disease, significant pleural effusion etc.), and any autoimmune, connective tissue or inflammatory disorder with pulmonary involvement (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren's syndrome, sarcoidosis etc.), and/or prior pneumonectomy (complete).\n10. Has an uncontrolled infection requiring intravenous injection of antibiotics, antivirals, or antifungals.\n11. Has clinically significant corneal disease.\n12. Know human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.\n13. Subjects have active viral (any etiology) hepatitis are excluded. However, subjects with positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) who have the HBV DNA (viral load) below the lower limit quantification or HBV DNA titer < 1000 cps/mL or 100 IU/mL per local testing and are not currently on viral suppressive therapy may be eligible and should be discussed with the Sponsor's Medical Monitor. However, subjects with a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection who have completed curative antiviral treatment and have the HCV RNA below the lower limit of quantification per local testing are eligible for study entry.\n14.

However, subjects with asymptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastases who are radiologically and neurologically stable for at least 4 weeks following CNS-directed therapy, and who are on stable or decreasing doses of corticosteroids equivalent to ≤10 mg/day prednisone are eligible for study entry.\n16. Has unresolved toxicities from previous anticancer therapy, defined as toxicities (other than alopecia) not yet resolved to NCI-CTCAE version 5.0, grade ≤ 1 or baseline. Subjects with chronic Grade 2 toxicities (e.g., Grade 2 neuropathy) may be eligible based on the discussion and agreement between Investigator and Sponsor.\n17.
