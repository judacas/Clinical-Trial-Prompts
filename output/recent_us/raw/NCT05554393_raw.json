    "official_title": "Phase I Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Feasibility of CK0801 in Treatment of Bone Marrow Failure Syndrome",
    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Subjects who fulfill the diagnostic criteria of bone marrow failure syndrome including: aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, or myelofibrosis.\n2. HLA matched (≥ 3/6) cord blood unit available for CK0801 generation.\n3. Subjects age ≥ 18 years.\n4. Bilirubin ≤ 2 x ULN and SGPT (ALT) ≤ 2 x ULN (unless Gilbert's syndrome is documented).\n5. Calculated creatinine clearance of > 50mL/min using the Cockcroft-Gault equation.\n6. Zubrod performance status ≤ 2.\n7. Female subjects of child bearing potential (FPCP) must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test. NOTE: FPCP is defined as premenopausal and not surgically sterilized. FPCP must agree to use maximally effective birth control or to abstain from heterosexual activity throughout the study. Effective contraceptive methods include intra-uterine device, oral and/or injectable hormonal; contraception, or 2 adequate barrier methods (e.g., cervical cap with spermicide, diaphragm with spermicide).\n8. Subject has agreed to abide by all protocol required procedures including study-related assessments, visits and long term follow up.\n9. Subject is willing and able to provide written informed consent.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Subject has received an investigational agent within 4 weeks prior to CK0801 infusion.\n2. Subject has received radiation or chemotherapy within 21 days prior to CK0801 infusion.\n3. Subject has received prior cord blood-derived T-regulatory therapy.\n4. HIV seropositivity.\n5. Subject has uncontrolled infection, not responding to appropriate antimicrobial agents after seven days of therapy. The Protocol PI is the final arbiter of eligibility.\n6. Subjects with uncontrolled inter-current illness that in the opinion of the investigator would place the patient at greater risk of severe toxicity and/or impair the activity of CK0801\n7. Subjects is pregnant or breastfeeding.\n8. Bone marrow failure caused by stem cell transplantation.\n9. Subjects who are unable to provide consent or who, in the opinion of the Investigator will be unlikely to fully comply with protocol requirements.",
