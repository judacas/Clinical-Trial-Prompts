    "inclusion_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria (Potential Subjects must):\n\n1. Be able and willing to provide documented informed consent prior to the conduct of any study procedures;\n2. Be an adult male or non-pregnant female ≥ 18 years of age;\n3. Report baseline pain scores of >65mm on a 100mm Visual Analog Scale (VAS) at screening;\n4. Have a documented diagnosis of symptomatic neuroma of at least one interdigital nerve in the foot which cannot be repaired to a distal nerve end;\n5. Must have the of the following:\n\n   * Pain with at least 3 of the following characteristics: burning, sharp, shooting, electric, parasthesias, numbness, cold intolerance;\n   * Symptoms in a defined neural anatomic distribution\n   * History of nerve injury or suspected nerve injury\n\n   Must have at least 1:\n   * Positive response to local anesthetic injection\n   * US or MRI confirmation of neuroma\n6. Be candidates indicated for surgery to address a symptomatic neuroma;\n7. Have sufficient healthy soft tissue available to adequately cover the Axoguard® Nerve Cap;\n8. In the surgeon's opinion, be likely to achieve complete resection of the symptomatic neuroma and be able to undergo implantation with the Axoguard® Nerve Cap or complete the neurotomy procedure in the control group;\n9. Be willing and able to comply with all aspects of the treatment and evaluation schedule over a 12-month duration.\n\nExclusion Criteria (Potential Subjects must not):\n\n1. Have undergone surgical treatment of pain from symptomatic neuroma in the target nerve(s)on three or more occasions;\n2. Have biomechanical pathology and associated pain (such as plantar fasciitis, bursitis, sesamoid bone pain, tendinitis, etc);\n3. Have a life expectancy of less than 12 months;\n4. Have a history of or planned radiotherapy in the area of the end-neuroma;\n5. be contraindicated for soft tissue implants.; this includes but is not limited to any pathology that would limit the blood supply; compromise healing or indicate the presence of a local infection;\n6. Have a history of chronic ischemic conditions of the extremity;\n7. Have a diagnosis of type 1 Diabetes Mellitus; or uncontrolled Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (at the discretion of the investigator);\n8. Have a history of diabetic neuropathy;\n9. Be undergoing or expected to undergo treatment with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or other known treatment which affects the growth of neural and/or vascular system;\n10. Be immunosuppressed, immunocompromised or have planned immunosuppressive therapy within 12 months following the study procedure;\n11. Have a History of congenital neuropathy or compressive neuropathy affecting the target limb;\n12. Have a history of prior surgical management of more proximal compressive neuropathies or spinal conditions (e.g. spinal stenosis) not related to the symptomatic neuroma that affect the target limb;\n13. Currently use or likely need to use medication during the study known to impact nerve regeneration or to cause peripheral neuropathy;\n14. Be pregnant or plan to become pregnant during the duration of the study;\n15. Be or have been enrolled in another interventional study within 30 days prior to consenting;\n16. Have a known allergy to anesthetic agents;\n17. Have a known sensitivity to porcine derived materials; or\n18. Be, in the opinion of the Investigator, unsuitable for inclusion in the study.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
