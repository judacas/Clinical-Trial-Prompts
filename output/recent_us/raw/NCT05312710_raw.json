    "official_title": "A Phase 1 Study of Autologous Activated T-cells Targeting the B7-H3 Antigen in Subjects With Recurrent Epithelial Ovarian Cancer",
    "inclusion_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria for the Study\n\n1. Written informed consent and HIPAA authorization for release of personal health information explained to, understood by, and signed by the subject or their legally authorized representative; subject was given a copy of the informed consent form.\n2. Older than 18 years at the time of consent.\n3. Subject has adequate performance status as defined by ECOG score of ≤ 2.\n4. Subjects must have histologically or cytologically confirmed epithelial ovarian, peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer and must have a histological diagnosis of high-grade serous histology based on local histopathological findings.\n5. Subjects must have recurrent platinum-resistant or platinum-refractory disease defined as:\n\n   1. Disease that has progressed by imaging while receiving platinum OR\n   2. Disease that has recurred within 6 months of the last receipt of platinum-based chemotherapy. Rising CA-125 only is not considered as a platinum-resistant or refractory disease.\n   3. Having received at least 2 prior regimens.\n   4. Have failed prior therapy with a PARP inhibitor if the subject has a germline or somatic BRCA mutation.\n6. Subjects must have an evaluable disease - defined as:\n\n   1. Measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 OR\n   2. Non-measurable disease (defined as solid and/or cystic abnormalities on radiographic imaging that do not meet RECIST 1.1 definitions for target lesions) OR\n   3. Ascites and/or pleural effusion that has been pathologically demonstrated to be disease-related in the setting of a CA-125 > 2 × ULN.\n\n8. Subjects must be able to have an intraperitoneal port placed either by vascular interventional radiology or surgically in the operating room. (Note: The intraperitoneal port will not be placed until the subject is determined to be otherwise eligible to receive the CAR.B7-H3 infusion and until the subject is determined to be otherwise eligible to receive lymphodepletion).\n\n9. Female subjects of childbearing potential must be willing to abstain from heterosexual activity or to use 2 forms of highly effective methods of contraception from the time of informed consent until 180 days after study treatment discontinuation. The two contraception methods can be comprised of two barrier methods, or a barrier method plus a hormonal method or an intrauterine device that meets < 1% failure rate for protection from pregnancy in the product label.\n\n10. Subject is willing and able to comply with study procedures based on the judgment of the investigator or protocol designee.\n\n11. Subject is willing to undergo a biopsy prior to treatment, at the time of final infusion, intraperitoneal catheter removal, and at the time of disease progression, and the tumor site is determined to be safe by the treating investigator for biopsy collection.\n\nEligibility Criteria Prior to Cell Procurement\n\n1. Written informed consent to undergo cell procurement is explained to, understood by, and signed by the subject; the subject is given a copy of the informed consent form for cell procurement.\n2. Subject has a life expectancy of≥ 3 months.\n3. Subject has evidence of adequate organ function as defined by:\n\n   1. Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × ULN, unless attributed to Gilbert's Syndrome\n   2. AST / ALT ≤ 3 × ULN (Note: if intrahepatic liver metastases are present, AST and ALT must be ≤ 5 × ULN)\n   3. Creatinine ≤ 2 × ULN\n   4. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) • 40%, as measured by ECHO, with no additional evidence of decompensated heart failure.\n4. Imaging results from within 90 days prior to procurement to assess the presence of active disease.\n5. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to cell procurement. Note: Females are considered of childbearing potential unless they are surgically sterile (have undergone a hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or they are naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months. Documentation of postmenopausal status must be provided.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Subject is pregnant or lactating (Note: Breast milk cannot be stored for future use while the mother is being treated in the study).\n2. Subject is deemed unlikely to be a candidate for successful intraperitoneal catheter placement by radiographic assessment.\n3. Subject has intraparenchymal lung metastases (note that pleural effusions are not exclusionary and that subjects with intraparenchymal liver disease and subjects with the retroperitoneal disease are allowed on the study).\n4. Subject has brain metastases. A subject with prior brain metastasis may be considered if they have completed their treatment for brain metastasis at least 4 weeks prior to being screened for eligibility, have been off of corticosteroids for ≥ 2 weeks, and are asymptomatic.\n5. Subject has current signs and/or symptoms of bowel obstruction or signs and/or symptoms of bowel obstruction within 3 months prior to starting treatment.\n6. Subject has a history of an intra-abdominal abscess within the past 3 months.\n7. Subject has a history of gastrointestinal perforation.\n8. The subject has a history of symptomatic diverticular disease, confirmed by CT or colonoscopy.\n9. Subject is dependent on intravenous hydration or total parenteral nutrition.\n10. Subject has a known additional malignancy that is active and/or progressive and requiring treatment; exceptions include basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical or bladder cancer, or other cancer for which the subject has been disease-free for at least five years.\n11. Current use of systemic corticosteroids at doses ≥10 mg prednisone daily or it's equivalent; those receiving <10 mg daily may be enrolled at the discretion of the investigator.\n12. Subject has active infection with HIV, HTLV, HBV, and HCV (tests can be pending at the time of cell procurement; only those samples confirming lack of active infection will be used to generate transduced cells). Note: To meet eligibility subjects are required to be negative for HIV antibody or HIV viral load, negative for HTLV1 and 2 antibodies or PCR negative for HTLV1 and 2, negative for Hepatitis B surface antigen, negative for HCV antibody or HCV viral load.",
