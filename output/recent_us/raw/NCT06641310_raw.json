For RMS efficacy cohort, disease must be measurable as defined by RECIST v1.1.\n\n   1. For the feasibility cohort, disease must be evaluable, but patients enrolled in the feasibility cohort will be prospectively assessed for measurable disease, RMS patients will also be included in the RMS efficacy cohort.\n   2. Previously irradiated lesions can be considered as measurable disease only if progressive disease has been unequivocally documented at that site since radiation.\n7. Availability of a tumor specimen suitable for determination of PD-L1 status, either from initial diagnosis or from a recurrence.\n\n   1.
