    "official_title": "A Phase III Randomized, Open-Label Study Evaluating Efficacy and Safety of Giredestrant Compared With Fulvestrant, Both Combined With a CDK4/6 Inhibitor, in Patients With Estrogen Receptor-Positive, HER2-Negative Advanced Breast Cancer With Resistance to Prior Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Locally advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast, not amenable to treatment with curative intent\n* Documented estrogen receptor-positive (ER+), HER2-negative (HER2-) tumor assessed locally on the most recent tumor biopsy (or an archived tumor sample if a recent tumor sample is not available for testing)\n* Confirmed ESR1 mutation status (ESR1m versus ESR1nmd) in baseline circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) through central laboratory testing\n* Resistance to prior adjuvant endocrine therapy (ET), which is defined as having relapsed with prior standard adjuvant ET, on-treatment after >/=12 months or off-treatment within 12 months of completion. Prior use of adjuvant CDK4/6i is allowed (if relapse occurred >/=12 months since completion).\n* No prior systemic anti-cancer therapy for advanced disease\n* Measurable disease as defined per RECIST v.1.1 or non-measurable (including bone-only) disease\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) 0-1\n* For pre/perimenopausal women and for men: willing to undergo and maintain treatment with approved LHRH agonist therapy (as per local guidelines) for the duration of study treatment\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Prior systemic therapy (e.g., prior chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or biologic therapy) for locally advanced unresectable or metastatic breast cancer\n* Prior treatment with another SERD (e.g., fulvestrant, oral SERDs) or novel ER-targeting agents\n* Advanced, symptomatic, visceral spread that is at risk of life-threatening complications in the short term\n* Active cardiac disease or history of cardiac dysfunction\n* Clinically significant history of liver disease",
