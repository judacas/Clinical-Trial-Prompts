Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status < 2 (Karnofsky >60%).\n4. Demonstrates adequate organ function as defined below:\n\n   1. Total bilirubin <1.5 X upper limit of normal (ULN).\n   2. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)(serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT)) <= 3 X institutional upper limit of normal (ULN).\n   3. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT)) <= 3 X institutional ULN.\n   4. Serum creatinine <=1,5 X institutional ULN or calculated creatinine clearance (Glomerular filtration rate (GFR)) >= 60 mL/min, calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault equation.\n5. Ability to understand a written informed consent document, and the willingness to sign it.\n6. Individuals with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen are eligible for this trial.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Patients who because of age, general medical, or psychiatric condition, or physiologic status cannot give valid informed consent.\n2. Any condition that, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator, would impair the patient's ability to comply with study procedures.",
