Transfusions and growth factors must not be used to meet these requirements at initial screening.\n* Hemoglobin (Hb) >= 8 g/dl. Transfusions and growth factors must not be used to meet these requirements at initial screening.\n* Platelet count >= 50,000/uL (>= 30,000/uL if bone marrow plasma cells are >= 50% of cellularity). Transfusions and growth factors must not be used to meet these requirements at initial screening.\n* Left ventricular ejection fraction >= 45% within 8 weeks before enrollment.\n* Oxygen (O2) saturation >= 92%.\n* Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP): Negative urine or serum pregnancy test.\n* If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required.\n* Agreement by females and males of childbearing potential to use an effective method of birth control or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course of the study through at least 3 months after the last dose of protocol therapy.\n\n  * Childbearing potential defined as not being surgically sterilized (men and women) or have not been free from menses for > 1 year (women only).\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Prior allogeneic stem cell transplantation.\n* Autologous transplantation =< 90 days of enrollment.\n* Growth factors within 14 days of enrollment.\n* Platelet transfusions within 7 days of enrollment.\n* Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) positivity by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) at the time of enrollment\n* Participants receiving any other investigational agents, or concurrent biological, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy.\n* Participants with known additional malignancy that is progressing or required active treatment within the last 2 years. Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or in situ cervical cancer that has undergone potentially curative therapy.\n* Participants with toxicities from prior therapies, with the exception of peripheral neuropathy attributable to bortezomib, that have not recovered to grade =< 2 according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 5.0 criteria or to the subject's prior baseline.\n* Participants with known active hepatitis B or C infection; research participants who are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive based on testing performed within 4 weeks of enrollment; research participants with any signs or symptoms of active infection, positive blood cultures or radiological evidence of infections.\n* Participants with active auto-immune disease, including connective tissue disease, sarcoidosis, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease or have a history of severe (as judged by the principal investigator) autoimmune disease that will require prolonged immunosuppressive therapy.\n* Have New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV heart failure, unstable angina, or a history of recent (within 6 months) myocardial infarction.\n* Participants with a history or presence of clinically relevant central nervous system (CNS) pathology such as uncontrolled seizure disorder, stroke, severe brain injuries, dementia, cerebellar disease or psychosis.\n* Participants with known active central nervous system (CNS) involvement by malignancy. Subjects with prior CNS disease that has been effectively treated will be eligible if treatment was completed at least 3 months prior to enrollment with no evidence of symptomatic disease and stable abnormalities on repeat imaging.\n* Participants with plasma cell leukemia (PCL) or symptomatic amyloidosis. However, participants with a prior history of PCL are not excluded.\n* Participants with any known contraindications to leukapheresis, cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, cetuximab or tocilizumab.\n* Dependence on corticosteroids.\n\n  * Defined as doses of corticosteroids of greater than or equal to 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent doses of other corticosteroids.\n  * Note: Topical and inhaled corticosteroids in standard doses and physiologic replacement for subjects with adrenal insufficiency are allowed.\n* Participants with inadequate venous access for leukapheresis, and who are either unable to or unwilling to have a supportive line (temporary or other) placed for the procedure.\n* Females only: Pregnant or breastfeeding.\n* Any other condition that would, in the Investigator's judgment, contraindicate the subject's participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns with clinical study procedures.\n* Prospective subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, may not be able to comply with all study procedures (including compliance issues related to feasibility/logistics).",
