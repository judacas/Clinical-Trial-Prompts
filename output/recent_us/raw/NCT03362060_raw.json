    "exclusion_criteria": "* Patients receiving any other investigational agents are ineligible\n* Part 1 patients who have not recovered to < Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade 2 toxicities related to prior therapy are ineligible\n* Patients with a history of hypersensitivity or allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to AMG 232 (KRT 232) are ineligible; the AMG 232 (KRT 232) investigator brochure can be referenced for more information\n* Patients on enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs (EIAED) are not eligible for treatment on this protocol; patients may be on non-enzyme inducing anti-epileptic drugs or not be taking any anti-epileptic drugs; patients previously treated with EIAED may be enrolled if they have been off the EIAED for 10 days or more prior to the first dose of AMG 232 (KRT 232)\n* Patients may not use herbal or non-traditional medications while receiving AMG 232 (KRT 232) therapy; all herbal medicines (e.g., St. John's wort), and supplements consumed by the subject within the 30 days prior to receiving the first dose of AMG 232 (KRT 232) should be reviewed by the principal investigator\n* Drugs known to be sensitive CYP3A4 substrates with narrow therapeutic windows (such as alfentanil, astemizole, cisapride, dihydroergotamine, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, or terfenadine) are not allowed; patients must be switched to alternative drugs at least 14 days prior to receiving the first dose of AMG 232 (KRT 232); those patients who cannot switch to alternative drugs will be excluded from the study; please note that the list of drugs above is not an exhaustive list; refer to reliable sources such as the FDA website (Drug development and drug interactions), or Micromedex when evaluating potential drug-interactions\n* Treatment with medications known to cause corrected QT (QTc) interval prolongation within 7 days of study day 1 is not permitted unless approved by the sponsor; use of ondansetron is permitted for treatment of nausea and vomiting\n* Patients may not be on warfarin, factor Xa inhibitors and direct thrombin inhibitors; Note: low molecular weight heparin and prophylactic low dose warfarin are permitted; APTT/PTT must meet the inclusion criteria; subjects taking low dose warfarin must have their international normalized ratio (INR) followed closely\n* Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements, are ineligible; patients with active infection requiring intravenous (IV) antibiotics within 2 weeks of study day 1 are excluded; patients with myocardial infarction within 6 months of study day 1, symptomatic congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class III and higher), unstable angina, or cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication are excluded\n* Patients with gastrointestinal (GI) tract disease causing the inability to take oral medication, malabsorption syndrome, requirement for intravenous alimentation, prior surgical procedures affecting absorption, uncontrolled inflammatory GI disease (e.g., Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis), are ineligible\n* Patients with history of bleeding diathesis are ineligible\n* Patients with positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HepBsAg), positive hepatitis total core antibody with negative HBsAG, or detectable hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (RNA) by a polymerase-chain reaction (PCR) assay are ineligible (screening is generally done by hepatitis C antibody [HepCAb], followed by hepatitis C virus RNA by PCR if HepCAb is positive)\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study as no studies evaluating the reproductive toxicity of AMG 232 (KRT 232) have been conducted to date; the teratogenic potential of AMG 232 (KRT 232) in laboratory animals, if any, is unknown; because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with AMG 232 (KRT 232), breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with AMG 232 (KRT 232) through 1 week after receiving the last dose of study drug\n* Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with AMG 232 (KRT 232); in addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy\n* Patients with a planned use of Novo-TTF (Optune) are ineligible",
