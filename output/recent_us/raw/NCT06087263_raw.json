Serum AST/serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) or ALT/serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) ≤ 3 x upper limit of normal (ULN) or ≤ 5 x ULN if presence of liver metastases\n   6. Total serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN (≤ 3 x ULN, if Gilbert's syndrome or if indirect bilirubin concentrations are suggestive of extrahepatic source of the elevation)\n   7. Creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥ 60 mL/minute based on Cockcroft-Gault or modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD) or ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
