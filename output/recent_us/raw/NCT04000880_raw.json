At the time of planned treatment start (C1D1), at least 21 or more days will have elapsed from palliative radiation (with the exception of radiation to >30% of bone marrow or with a wide field of radiation, this requires 28 or more days).\n12. Patient must have normal organ and bone marrow function measured within 42 days prior to registration as defined below\n\n    1.

Platelet count ≥100x109/L (with no platelet transfusions within last 42 days)\n    4. Total bilirubin <1.5x ULN (unless the patient has documented Gilbert's disease and <2.0x ULN should be used)\n    5. AST or ALT ≤ 2.5x ULN, unless liver metastases are present in which case they cannot be ≥5x ULN\n    6. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ≥51 mL/min, as assessed using the Cockcroft- Gault equation\n13. Estimated life expectancy ≥16 weeks\n14. Male patients who are sexually active must be willing to use barrier contraception for the duration of the study and for 1 week after the last study drug administration, with all sexual partners. Male patients must use a condom during treatment and for 6 months after the last dose of study drug(s) when having sexual intercourse with a pregnant woman or with a woman of childbearing potential and must not donate sperm for 6 months after the last dose of study drug. Female partners of male patients should also use a highly effective form of contraception (per protocol) for 6 months after the last dose of study drug(s) if they are of childbearing potential. True abstinence is an acceptable form of contraception and must be documented as such.\n15. Patient is willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study, including undergoing biopsy (if warranted), treatment, scheduled visits and examinations\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be MALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. A diagnosis of ataxia telangiectasia\n2. Prior treatment with a PARP inhibitor (e.g. olaparib, veliparib, niraparib, rucaparib), AZD6738 or other DNA-damage response agents (e.g. cisplatin or carboplatin)\n3. Cytotoxic chemotherapy, first- or second-generation antiandrogen or CYP17 inhibitors are not permitted within 21 days or 5 half-lives of registration (whichever is longest) of planned treatment start. For clarity, enzalutamide requires 5 weeks washout.\n4. Major surgery < 2 weeks prior to enrolment; patients must have recovered from any effects of major surgery\n5. Persistent toxicities (≥CTCAE Grade 2) caused by previous cancer therapy, besides Grade 2 alopecia and Grade 2 neuropathy (these are allowed).\n6. Patients with current or prior MDS/AML or with features suggestive of MDS/AML\n7. Any other malignancy which has been active or treated within the past 3 years, with the exception of non-melanomatous skin cancer, or Ta bladder cancer\n8. Patients with active brain metastases are excluded because of unknown penetration into the CNS. A confirmatory scan for asymptomatic patients is not required. Patients with a history of treated central nervous system (CNS) metastases are eligible provided they meet all of the following criteria: disease outside the CNS is present, no clinical evidence of progression since completion of CNS-directed therapy, minimum 3 weeks between completion of radiotherapy and registration and recovery from significant (Grade ≥ 3) acute toxicity with no ongoing requirement for >10 mg of prednisone per day or an equivalent dose of other corticosteroid. If a patient must remain on steroids, they must have started the steady dose at least 28 days prior to treatment. Patients with spinal cord compression unless considered to have received definitive treatment for this and evidence of clinically stable disease for 28 days prior to study treatment.\n9. Any of the following cardiac disease currently or within the last 6 months:\n\n   1. Unstable angina pectoris\n   2.

Patients at risk of brain perfusion problems, e.g. TIAs or history of pre- syncope or syncopal episodes unexplained by reversible causes\n10. Mean resting corrected QT interval >450, obtained from 3 ECGs 2-5 minutes apart using the Fredericia formula.

Patients with relative hypotension (<90/60 mmHg) or previously known clinically relevant orthostatic hypotension defined as a postural hypotension ≥20 mmHg\n11. Concomitant use of known potent or moderate cytochrome P (CYP) 3A inhibitors (e.g. itraconazole, ciprofloxacin, diltiazem) require 2-week washout prior to planned C1D1. Concomitant use of strong or moderate CYP3A inducers (e.g. phenobarbital, enzalutamide, modafinil require 5-week washout for enzalutamide or phenobarbital and 3 week washout for all others, per protocol.\n12. As judged by the Investigator, any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic diseases that places the patient at unacceptable risk of toxicity or non-compliance. Examples include, but are not limited to, active bleeding diatheses, renal transplant, uncontrolled major seizure disorder, severe COPD, superior vena cava syndrome, extensive bilateral lung disease on High Resolution CT scan, severe Parkinson's disease, active inflammatory bowel disease, psychiatric condition, immunocompromised patients or active infection including any patient known to have hepatitis B, hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or requiring systemic antibiotics, antifungals or antiviral drugs.

Whole blood transfusions in the last 120 days prior to entry to the study (packed red blood cells and platelet transfusions are acceptable, for timing refer to inclusion criteria no.12)\n17.
