    "exclusion_criteria": "* Known active CNS disease, or primary CNS lymphoma.\n* Known bleeding disorders.\n* Known history of stroke or intracranial hemorrhage within 12 months prior to first dose of study treatment.\n* Uncontrolled active systemic infection, or active cytomegalovirus infection.\n* Active hepatitis B or C infection.\n* Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).\n* Known active COVID-19 infection.
