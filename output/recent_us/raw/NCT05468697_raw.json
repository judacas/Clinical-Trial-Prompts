Fusions may be identified by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or molecular techniques (reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR] using primers flanking the fusion junction or next generation sequencing). For fusions identified by FISH, an ETV6 rearrangement is sufficient for eligibility in Cohort A. Identification of the upstream TRK fusion partner is not required.\n* COHORT B: Patients must have a histologic diagnosis of any solid tumor other than infantile fibrosarcoma, including central nervous system (CNS) tumors but excluding high grade gliomas. An NTRK1, NTRK2, or NTRK3 fusion must be identified in a CLIA/CAP certified laboratory. Fusions may be identified by FISH or molecular techniques (RT-PCR using primers flanking the fusion junction or next generation sequencing). For fusions identified by FISH, there must be an identified rearrangement in NTRK1, NTRK2, or NTRK3 (e.g., an ETV6 rearrangement is not sufficient for eligibility) unless the patient has a diagnosis of congenital mesoblastic nephroma in which case an ETV6 rearrangement is sufficient for eligibility. Identification of the upstream TRK fusion partner is not required.\n* COHORT C: Patients must have a histologic diagnosis of relapsed or refractory acute leukemia with an NTRK1, NTRK2, or NTRK3 fusion identified in a CLIA/CAP certified laboratory. Fusions may be identified by FISH or molecular techniques (RT-PCR using primers flanking the fusion junction or next generation sequencing). For fusions identified by FISH, there must be an identified rearrangement in NTRK1, NTRK2, or NTRK3 (e.g., an ETV6 rearrangement is not sufficient for eligibility). Identification of the upstream TRK fusion partner is not required.\n* SOLID TUMORS (COHORTS A AND B): Patients must have measurable disease. Patients must have disease that cannot be completely resected without a predicted functional, neurologic, or significant cosmetic deficit in the opinion of the investigator.\n* LEUKEMIA (COHORT C): Patients must have >= 5% blasts in the bone marrow.
