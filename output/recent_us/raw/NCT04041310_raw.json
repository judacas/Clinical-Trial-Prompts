Live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), and typhoid (oral) vaccine. Patients are permitted to receive inactivated vaccines and any non-live vaccines including those for the seasonal influenza and COVID-19 (Note: intranasal influenza vaccines, such as Flu-Mist [registered trademark] are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed). If possible, it is recommended to separate study drug administration from vaccine administration by about a week (primarily, in order to minimize an overlap of adverse events)\n* Patient must have the presence of injectable and measurable disease based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1, documented by scans obtained within 4 weeks prior to randomization\n\n  * NOTE: Injectable disease is defined as an accessible lesion in the skin, subcutaneous tissue or lymph nodes (LN) close to the skin and palpable by physical examination or approachable with ultrasound guidance\n* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >= 1,500 /mcL (obtained within 4 weeks prior to randomization)\n* Hemoglobin (Hgb) >= 9 g/dL or >= 5.6 mmol/L (obtained within 4 weeks prior to randomization)\n* Platelets >= 100,000 / mcL (obtained within 4 weeks prior to randomization)\n* Serum creatinine =< 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) or measured or calculated creatinine clearance > 60 mL/min (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] can also be used in place of creatinine or creatinine clearance [CrCl] for patients with creatinine levels > 1.5 x institutional ULN) (obtained within 4 weeks prior to randomization)\n* Serum total bilirubin =< 1.5 x institutional ULN; for total bilirubin level > 1.5 x ULN but =< 3 x ULN, the direct bilirubin must be =< the institutional ULN (obtained within 4 weeks prior to randomization)\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT]) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT]) =< 2.5 x institutional ULN (obtained within 4 weeks prior to randomization)\n* International normalized ratio (INR) or prothrombin time (PT) =< 1.5 x institutional ULN unless patient is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or partial thromboplastin time (PTT) is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants (obtained within 4 weeks prior to randomization)\n* Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) =< 1.5 x institutional ULN unless patient is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants (obtained within 4 weeks prior to randomization)\n* Patients must not be pregnant or breast-feeding due to the potential harm to an unborn fetus and possible risk for adverse events in nursing infants with the treatment regimens being used. All patients of childbearing potential must have a blood test or urine study within 14 days prior to randomization to rule out pregnancy. A urine or serum pregnancy test must be repeated within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of pembrolizumab if the test done for eligibility/randomization is done outside of this 72 hour window. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required. A patient of childbearing potential is defined as anyone, regardless of sexual orientation or whether they have undergone tubal ligation, who meets the following criteria: 1) has achieved menarche at some point, 2) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 3) has not been naturally postmenopausal (amenorrhea following cancer therapy does not rule out childbearing potential) for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months)\n* Patients must not expect to conceive or father children by using accepted and effective method(s) of contraception or abstaining from sexual intercourse from time of randomization, while on study treatment, and continue for 26 weeks after the last dose of protocol treatment\n* Patient must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. Patients with impaired decision-making capacity (IDMC) who have a legally authorized representative (LAR) or caregiver and/or family member available will also be considered eligible\n* Patient must not have received prior systemic therapy for melanoma including systemic therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-CTLA-4, BRAF/MEK inhibitor combination and/or TLR-9 agonist\n* Patient must not have a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or be receiving systemic steroid therapy or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to randomization, except as noted here\n\n  * Patients who are currently receiving steroids at a dose of prednisone =< 5 mg daily (or equivalent) are permitted to enroll\n  * Patients who require topical, ophthalmologic and inhalational steroids are permitted to enroll\n  * Patients with hypothyroidism who are stable on hormone replacement are permitted to enroll\n  * Patients who require active immunosuppression with corticosteroids at a dose of prednisone > 5 mg daily (or equivalent) for any reason are ineligible\n  * Patients with adrenal insufficiency are ineligible\n  * Patients who have developed autoimmune disorders of grade 4 while on prior immunotherapy are not permitted to enroll on this study. Patients who developed autoimmune disorders of grade =< 3 may enroll if the disorder has resolved to grade =< 1 and the patient has been off systemic corticosteroids at doses > 5 mg for at least 2 weeks prior to randomization\n* Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients on effective anti-retroviral therapy with undetectable viral load within 6 months prior to randomization are eligible for this trial\n* For patients with evidence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, the HBV viral load must be undetectable on suppressive therapy, if indicated\n* Patients with a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection must have been treated and cured. For patients with HCV infection who are currently on treatment, they are eligible if they have an undetectable HCV viral load\n* Patients with a history of brain metastases are not eligible for this study as they do not meet the eligibility staging criteria\n* Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen are eligible for this trial\n* Patients with known history or current symptoms of cardiac disease, or history of treatment with cardiotoxic agents, should have a clinical risk assessment of cardiac function using the New York Heart Association Functional Classification. To be eligible for this trial, patients should be class 2B or better\n* Patient must not have had an allogeneic tissue/solid organ transplant\n* Patient must not have a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or current pneumonitis\n* Patient must not have severe hypersensitivity (>= grade 3) to pembrolizumab and/or any of its excipients\n* Patient must not have an active infection requiring systemic therapy\n* Patient must not have a known psychiatric or substance abuse disorder that would interfere with the patient's ability to cooperate with the requirements of the study\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
