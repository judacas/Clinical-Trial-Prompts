    "exclusion_criteria": "* Prior allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. (Patients may have received a prior autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant.)\n* Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents within 14 days prior to RGI-2001 dosing. Thus, participants must stop investigational agents by Day -9 prior to transplant.\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, symptomatic congestive heart failure, recent myocardial infarction or stroke, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* Patients with active or uncontrolled bacterial, viral, or fungal infection(s) requiring systemic therapy.\n* Planned use of prophylactic donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) therapy.\n* Pregnant and breast-feeding women are ineligible because they are not eligible for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.\n* HIV-positive participants and patients with active Hepatitis B or C are ineligible",
