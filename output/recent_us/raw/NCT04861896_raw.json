for growth factors that have known adverse events occurring beyond 7 days after administration, this period must be extended beyond the time during which adverse events are known to occur; the duration of this interval must be discussed with the study chair and the study-assigned research coordinator\n  * Interleukins, interferons and cytokines (other than hematopoietic growth factors): >= 21 days after the completion of interleukins, interferon or cytokines (other than hematopoietic growth factors)\n  * Stem cell Infusions (with or without total-body irradiation [TBI]):\n\n    * Allogeneic (non-autologous) bone marrow or stem cell transplant, or any stem cell infusion including donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) or boost infusion: >= 84 days after infusion and no evidence of graft versus host disease (GVHD)\n    * Autologous stem cell infusion including boost infusion: >= 42 days\n  * Cellular therapy: >= 42 days after the completion of any type of cellular therapy (e.g. modified T cells, natural killer [NK] cells, dendritic cells, etc.)\n  * Radiation therapy (XRT)/external beam irradiation including protons: >= 14 days after local XRT; >= 150 days after TBI, craniospinal XRT or if radiation to >= 50% of the pelvis; >= 42 days if other substantial bone marrow (BM) radiation; Note: Radiation may not be delivered to \"measurable disease\" tumor site(s) being used to follow response to subprotocol treatment\n  * Radiopharmaceutical therapy (e.g., radiolabeled antibody, iobenguane I-131 [131I-MIBG]): >= 42 days after systemically administered radiopharmaceutical therapy\n  * Patients must not have received prior exposure to a BRAF inhibitor (e.g. vemurafenib, dabrafenib or encorafenib)\n* For patients with solid tumors without known bone marrow involvement:\n\n  * Peripheral absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >= 1000/mm^3\n  * Platelet count >= 100,000/mm^3 (transfusion independent, defined as not receiving platelet transfusions for at least 7 days prior to enrollment)\n* Patients with known bone marrow metastatic disease will be eligible for study provided they meet the blood counts in above criteria (may receive transfusions provided they are not known to be refractory to red cell or platelet transfusions); these patients will not be evaluable for hematologic toxicity\n* Creatinine clearance or radioisotope glomerular filtration rate (GFR) >= 70 ml/min/1.73 m^2 or a serum creatinine based on age/gender as follows:\n\n  * Age: 1 to < 2 years;
