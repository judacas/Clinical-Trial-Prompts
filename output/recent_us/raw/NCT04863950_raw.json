    "exclusion_criteria": "* Cohort A and C: Patients with a history of prior treatment with checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CD137, anti-OX-40, anti-CD40, anti-CTLA-4, or anti-LAG-3 antibodies. NOTE: Prior therapy with interferon-alpha is allowed.\n* Cohort B: Participants a with history of unacceptable, life-threatening toxicity related to prior immune therapy (eg, anti-CTLA-4 or anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment, any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation or immune checkpoint pathways) except those that are unlikely to re-occur with standard countermeasures (eg, hormone replacement after endocrinopathy).\n\nAll Cohorts:\n\n* Have had chemotherapy or other systemic therapy or radiotherapy, as follows:\n\n  * Have had chemotherapy, biological cancer therapy, or radiation 14 days prior to the first dose of study drug.\n  * Have had surgery within 28 days of dosing of investigational agent, excluding minor procedures (dental work, skin biopsy, etc.), celiac plexus block, and biliary stent placement.\n  * Have received other approved or investigational agents or device within 28 days of the first dose of study drug.\n  * Have not recovered from acute adverse events to grade ≤1 or baseline due to agents administered.\n* Have received any non-oncology live vaccine therapy used for prevention of infectious diseases within 28 days of study treatment\n* Known sensitivity to or history of allergic reactions to investigational drug (s).\n* Hypersensitivity reaction to any monoclonal antibody.\n* Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years, or a documented history of clinically severe autoimmune disease, or a syndrome that requires systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents.\n* Presence of any tissue or organ allograft, regardless of need for immunosuppression, including corneal allograft. Patients with a history of allogeneic hematopoeitic stem cell transplant will be excluded.\n* Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency.\n* Systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (>10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications within 7 days of study drug administration.\n* Symptomatic interstitial lung disease.\n* Has a pulse oximetry of <92% on room air or is on supplemental home oxygen.\n* Active or untreated brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases.\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, uncontrolled infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina, cardiac arrhythmia, metastatic cancer, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* Are pregnant or breastfeeding.\n* Infection with HIV or hepatitis B or C.\n* Have had evidence of active or acute diverticulitis, intra-abdominal abscess, or GI obstruction.\n* Unwilling or unable to follow the study schedule for any reason.\n* Any other sound medical, psychiatric, and/or social reason as determined by the Investigator.\n* Any illicit drugs or other substance abuse.\n* Clinically meaningful ascites.",
