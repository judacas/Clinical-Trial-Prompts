Ability to understand and the willingness to sign written informed consent and assent documents.\n* Must have established relationship with primary care physician and provide contact information\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 12 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Participants who have had chemotherapy within a minimum of 4 weeks prior to Master Study registration (or a minimum of 5 half-lives and resolution to baseline of toxicities unless there are irreversible toxicities from prior drug that do not influence risk of next drug).\n* Participants who have received radiation to the target tumor within the last 3 years prior to Master study registration.\n* Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.\n* Participants with target or non-target nervous system tumors that, in the opinion of the treating investigator, are likely to require active treatment (including surgery) within 6 months of registration to the Master Study.\n* History of a different malignancy, unless (a) have been disease-free for at least 2 years and are deemed by the treating investigator to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy.\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the experimental agents may have the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with these experimental agents, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated.\n\nEligibility Criteria Specific to SUB-STUDY A (Brigatinib arm): CLOSED TO ENROLLMENT\n\nInclusion criteria\n\n* Participants must meet all eligibility criteria outlined in the Master Study\n* Participants must be willing and able to provide written informed consent/assent for the brigatinib arm of the INTUITT-NF2 trial.\n* Participant is ≥ 12 years of age and has body weight at least 40 kg on Day 1 of treatment.\n* Patient must be able to swallow pills.\n* Clinical laboratory values as specified below within 28 days before the first dose of study drug, as described in the protocol document:\n* Female patients participating in this study should avoid becoming pregnant, and male patients should avoid impregnating a female partner.

Brigatinib may decrease effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives, therefore, women are recommended to use non-hormonal methods of contraception. Highly effective non-hormonal birth control for women of child bearing potential with male partners includes:\n\n  * Sexual abstinence (no sexual intercourse)\n  * Intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)\n  * Bilateral tubal ligation (both tubes tied)\n  * Vasectomized partner\n\nMale patients, even if surgically sterilized (i.e., status post-vasectomy) must agree to 1 of the following:\n\n- Practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study treatment period and through 4 months after the last dose of study drug, or completely abstain from heterosexual intercourse.\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\n* Female patients who are both lactating and breastfeeding or have a positive serum pregnancy test during the screening period or a positive urine pregnancy test on Day 1 before first dose of study drug (if applicable)\n* Any serious medical or psychiatric illness that could, in the investigator's opinion, potentially interfere with the completion of treatment according to this protocol\n* Treatment with any investigational products within 1 month or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) before the first dose of study drug\n* Had major surgery within 30 days of the first dose of brigatinib.
