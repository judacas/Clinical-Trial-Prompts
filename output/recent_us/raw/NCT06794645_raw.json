    "official_title": "HM2023-05: GTB-3650 (Anti-CD16/IL-15/Anti-CD33) Tri-Specific Killer Engager (TriKE®) for the Treatment of High Risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) and Refractory/Relapsed Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) ≥ 200 cells/µL OR absolute circulating CD56+/CD3- NK cell count >25 cells/µL within the 14 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1.\n* Peripheral blasts ≤20,000 at the time of treatment start. Hydroxyurea may be used up to Day 1 of the 1st cycle to achieve this threshold and continued for the 1st two weeks of Cycle 1 to maintain it.\n* Adequate organ function within 14 days (30 days for cardiac) of Cycle 1 Day 1\n* Sexually active persons of childbearing potential or persons with partners of childbearing potential must agree to use a highly effective form of contraception during study treatment and for at least 4 months after the last dose of GTB-3650. Non-childbearing is defined as >1 year postmenopausal or surgically sterilized.\n\n-For the Dose Finding Component Only: Must agree to stay within a 60- minute drive of the Study Center through the Cycle 1 Day 29 visit (end of the Dose Limiting Toxicity period).\n\n* Provides voluntary written consent prior to the performance of any research related activity.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Pregnant or breast-feeding. The effect of GTB-3650 TriKE on the fetus is unknown. Persons of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine test within 7 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 to rule out pregnancy.\n* A candidate for hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) or newly relapsed after HSCT (e.g. no post-HSCT therapy given).\n* Bi-phenotypic acute leukemia or mixed lineage leukemia.\n* Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL).\n* New or progressive pulmonary infiltrates on screening chest x-ray or chest CT scan unless cleared for study by Pulmonary. Infiltrates attributed to infection must be stable/improving with associated clinical improvement after 1 week of appropriate therapy (4 weeks for presumed or documented fungal infections).\n* Active systemic infection requiring parenteral antibiotic therapy. Any prior systemic infections must have resolved following optimal therapy.\n* Known history of HIV.\n* Active Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C (virus detectable by PCR) - chronic asymptomatic viral hepatitis is allowed.\n* Positive test results from chronic hepatitis B infection (defined as positive HBsAg serology) and/or positive test results for hepatitis C (HCV antibody serology test).\n* Prior malignancy except for the following: adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, adequately treated Stage I or II cancer currently in complete remission, or any other cancer from which the patient has been disease-free for 1 year\n* Active central nervous system (CNS) malignancy or symptoms of CNS spread or administration of IT chemotherapy within 14 days prior to Day 1.\n* Extramedullary disease causing symptoms and/or involving the CNS or spinal canal - asymptomatic extramedullary disease outside the CNS and spinal canal is eligible provided the marrow has measurable disease.\n* Known autoimmune disease requiring active treatment or persons with a condition requiring systemic treatment with steroids (> 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days before Cycle 1 Day 1. Inhaled or topical steroids, and adrenal replacement steroid doses ≤ 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent, are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease\n* The potential risk of QT/QTc prolongation is unknown in humans receiving\n\nTriKE therefore either of the following is an exclusion criteria:\n\n* QTc interval > 480 msec at screening\n* A family history of long QT syndrome\n* Psychiatric illness/social situations that, in the judgement of the enrolling Investigator, would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* Other illness or a medical issue that, in the judgement of the enrolling Investigator, would exclude the patient from participating in this study.",
