    "inclusion_criteria": "* Escalation A: participants with documented histopathological diagnosis of locally advanced or metastatic STS with unresectable disease that has progressed after at least one prior line of systemic therapy for the metastatic setting including anthracyclines. Previous trabectidin, eribulin, pazopanib or any other drug approved for the different STS subtypes in second line (2L) or beyond will not be required for enrollment but will be allowed (for example [e.g] trabectedin, pazopanib for leiomyosarcoma (LMS); ifosfamide, gemcitabine-based combinations, trabectedin, eribulin, pazopanib for liposarcoma (LPS); trabectedin, gemcitabine, and docetaxel, pazopanib for undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma [UPS]). Participants with resectable locally advanced or metastatic disease, who had surgery before study entry will be allowed in the trial if there is residual disease after surgery and if the surgery was performed at least 4 weeks before first dose of study intervention.\n* Escalation B: participants with documented histopathological diagnosis of glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype, who have progressed after ONLY one prior line of therapy (including radiotherapy +/- temozolomide, depending on the O^6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase [MGMT] status) and relapsing at least 3 months after the end of the radiotherapy treatment.\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) below or equal to 1\n* Participants with adequate hematologic, hepatic and renal function as defined in protocol\n* Other protocol defined inclusion criteria could apply\n\n  *\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
