Patients may be enrolled if they have treated brain metastases with no evidence of progression or hemorrhage after therapy for brain metastases (e.g. radiation therapy, surgery, radiosurgery) AND\n   2. Patients may be enrolled if they do not require ongoing treatment with dexamethasone or anti-epileptic drugs\n5. Has had radiation therapy for bone metastases within 2 weeks, or any other external radiation therapy (5 days or longer) to sites other than bone, within 4 weeks before administration of the first dose of study treatment. Patients with clinically relevant ongoing major complications from prior radiation therapy are not eligible.\n6. Has uncontrolled or poorly controlled hypertension, as defined by a sustained blood pressure (BP) > 140/90 with or without antihypertensive treatment\n7. Has had any major cardiovascular event within 6 months prior to study drug administration including but not limited to myocardial infarction, unstable angina, cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic attack, pulmonary embolism, clinically significant ventricular arrhythmias (e.g. sustained ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, torsades de pointes) or New York Heart Association Class III or IV heart failure\n8. Has any other clinically significant cardiac, respiratory, or other medical or psychiatric condition that might interfere with participation in the trial or interfere with the interpretation of trial results, in the opinion of the investigator or medical monitor\n9.

Is receiving chronic concomitant treatment with strong CYP3A4 inducers or CYP3A4 inhibitors\n12. Has manifestations of malabsorption due to prior gastrointestinal (GI) surgery or GI disease\n13. Has GI disorders including those associated with a high risk of perforation or fistula formation:\n\n    1.

Abdominal fistula, GI perforation, bowel obstruction, or intra-abdominal abscess within 6 months before administration of the first dose of study treatment. Note: complete healing of an intra-abdominal abscess must be confirmed before administration of the first dose of study treatment\n14. Has tumor invading or encasing any major blood vessels\n15. Has other clinically significant disorders such as:\n\n    1. Serious non-healing wound/ulcer/bone fracture\n    2. Moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C).\n    3. Requirement for hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis\n    4. History of solid organ transplantation\n16. Has had major surgery (e.g., GI surgery, removal or biopsy of brain metastasis) within 2 months before the first study drug administration. Complete wound healing from major surgery must have occurred 1 month before the first study drug administration and from minor surgery (e.g., simple excision, tooth extraction) at least 10 days before the first study drug administration. Patients with clinically relevant ongoing complications from prior surgery are not eligible\n17.
