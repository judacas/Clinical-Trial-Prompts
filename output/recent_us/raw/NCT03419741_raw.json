    "official_title": "A Pilot Study of Heated Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC) After Interval Cytoreductive Surgery (CRS) in Patients Who Have Received Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy (NACT) for Epithelial Ovarian, Fallopian Tube and Primary Peritoneal Cancers",
    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Histologically confirmed cancer of the ovary, fallopian tube or peritoneum.\n2. Women of all races and ethnicities are eligible for this trial.\n3. Age > 18.\n4. The patient must have documented disease limited to the abdomen and pelvis that is amenable to complete CRS indicated by:\n\n   1. Disease confined to the peritoneal surfaces.\n   2. No clinical or radiological evidence of hematogenous or distant (extra-abdominal) nodal metastasis.\n5. Evidence of response to NACT must as documented by at least one of the following: decline in serum CA125 level, at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions on radiographic imaging, or resolution of ascites or pleural effusion(s).\n6. Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) performance status <= 2\n7. Leukocytes >= 3,000/microliter (mcL), absolute neutrophil count >= 1,500/mcL, platelets >= 100,000/mcL\n8. Adequate hepatic function as measured by total bilirubin within normal institutional limits, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT))/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT)) =< 2.5 x institutional upper limit of normal\n9. Creatinine within normal institutional limits OR creatinine clearance >= 60 mL/min for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal\n10. Albumin >= 2.5 mg/dL\n11. Satisfactory cardiopulmonary function (no history of severe congestive heart failure or severe pulmonary disease, as indicated by clinically acceptable risks to undergo major abdominal surgery\n12. Voluntary participation after getting written informed consent\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be FEMALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 85 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Prior chemotherapy (other than NACT) or whole abdomen radiation for ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancers.\n2. Patients with an active second malignancy regardless of site.\n3. Uncontrolled inter-current illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements\n4. Pregnant or breast-feeding patients\n5. Patients who are receiving other oncologic investigational therapeutic agents\n6. Patients receiving NACT whose disease has progressed following at least 3 cycles of platinum-based therapy, defined by at least one of the following: clinical deterioration (new or worsening of existing ascites, carcinomatous ileus, malignant bowel obstruction, declining performance status); new lesion(s) or increase in maximal diameter of > 20% of the two largest target lesions; rising CA-125 (an increase of at least 10% of baseline value that increases over 3 values obtained every 21 days).\n7. Cardiac or pulmonary conditions that preclude aggressive cytoreductive surgery.\n8. Patients found to have non-gynecologic cancer at the time of surgery.\n9. Patients with gynecologic malignancy of low-grade serous or borderline histology.",
