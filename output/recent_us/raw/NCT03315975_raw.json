For this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men with partners of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to leukapheresis and until 6 months post CAR-37 infusion. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.

If febrile, the patient must be afebrile for 24 hours and blood cultures negative for 48 hours on appropriate antibiotic therapy.\n* Oxygen saturation >92% on room air while awake.\n* No additional anti-cancer therapy since leukapheresis excluding steroids at or below physiologic dosing.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Prior CD37 targeted therapies.\n* Treatment with an any investigational cellular therapy within 8 weeks prior to apheresis.\n* Any systemic anti-cancer therapy within 1 weeks of leukapheresis excluding steroids at or below physiologic dosing.\n* Ongoing treatment with chronic immunosuppressants (e.g., cyclosporine or systemic steroids above physiologic dosing). Intermittent topical, inhaled, or intranasal corticosteroids are allowed.\n* Ongoing systemic immunosuppression for acute and/or chronic GVH as a result of previous allogeneic bone marrow transplant and at least 12 weeks out from prior allogeneic SCT.\n* Significant co-morbid condition or disease which in the judgment of the Principal Investigator would place the subject at undue risk or interfere with the study; examples include, but are not limited to, cirrhotic liver disease, sepsis, and/or recent significant traumatic injury.\n* Active, uncontrolled, systemic bacterial, viral, or fungal infection.\n* Subjects with a history of class III or IV congestive heart failure or with a history of non- ischemic cardiomyopathy.\n* Subjects with unstable angina, myocardial infarction, or ventricular arrhythmia requiring medication or mechanical control within the previous 3 months.\n* Subjects with arterial vascular disease such as history of cerebrovascular accident or peripheral vascular disease requiring therapeutic anti-coagulation.\n* Subjects with history of a new pulmonary embolism within 6 months of beginning lymphodepletion.\n* Subjects with second malignancies if the second malignancy has required therapy in the last 3 years or is not in complete remission; exceptions to this criterion include successfully treated non-metastatic basal cell or squamous cell skin carcinoma, or prostate cancer that does not require therapy other than hormonal therapy.\n* Pregnant or lactating women",
