    "inclusion_criteria": "* Voluntarily sign informed consent form(s)\n* ≥18 years of age at the time of signing informed consent\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2 (Karnofsky ≥60%, see Appendix A)\n* Diagnosis of histologically or cytologically confirmed relapsed/refractory (R/R) Non Hodgkins lymphoma as defined as one of the following (Note: only patients with indolent lymphomas that warrant treatment should be treated, this will include those with local symptoms due to progressive/bulky disease, compromised organ function, B symptoms, extra-nodal disease, cytopenias from marrow involvement and/or in the opinion of the treating physician believe that any of the above symptoms or potentially life threatening involvement will occur will be treated):\n\n  1. Follicular Lymphoma (FL) grade 1, grade 2, or grade 3a\n\n     1. R/R disease after 2 or more prior lines of systemic therapy\n  2. Marginal Zone Lymphoma (MZL) nodal of extranodal:\n\n     1. R/R disease after 2 or more prior lines of systemic therapy\n  3. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), including transformed follicular lymphoma (FL), primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL), high-grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBCL) and grade 3b Follicular Lymphoma (FL).\n\n     1. R/R disease after 2 or more prior lines of therapy OR\n     2. Relapsed following autologous SCT, OR\n     3. Ineligible for autologous SCT.\n  4. Mantle cell lymphoma\n\n     1. R/R disease as defined by disease progression after last regimen (including autologous SCT) OR\n     2. Refractory disease as defined as failure to achieve a CR to last regimen.\n     3. Prior therapy must include:\n\n        * Anthracycline or bendamustine-containing chemotherapy AND\n        * Anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody therapy AND\n        * BTKi therapy (progression does not have to be documented on BTKi).\n* Subjects must have measurable disease according to appropriate disease specific criteria.\n* Adequate absolute lymphocyte count (ALC > 100 cells/ul) within one week of apheresis.\n* Adequate bone marrow function defined by absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >1000 cells/mm3 without growth factor support (filgrastim within 7 days or pegfilgrastim within 14 days) and untransfused platelet count >50,000 mm3.\n* Left ventricular ejection fraction > 40%\n* Adequate hepatic function defined by aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) < 2.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) and direct bilirubin < 1.5 × ULN.\n* Adequate renal function defined by creatinine clearance >60 ml/min using the Cockcroft-Gault formula.\n* The effects of CD79b-19 CAR T cells on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men with partners of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to leukapheresis. Women of childbearing potential are required to use adequate contraception for up to 1 year post CD79b-19 CAR T cell infusion. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men with partners of childbearing potential treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study and until 6 months after last CD79b-19 CAR T cells administration.\n* Ability and willingness to adhere to the study visit schedule and all protocol requirements\n\nInclusion Criteria for treatment (Initiating Lymphodepletion/Cell Infusion):\n\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2 (Karnofsky ≥60%, see Appendix A)\n* No active, uncontrolled, systemic bacterial, viral, or fungal infection. If febrile, the patient must be afebrile for 24 hours and blood cultures negative for 48 hours on appropriate antibiotic therapy\n* Oxygen saturation >92% on room air while awake\n* No additional anti-cancer therapy since leukapheresis excluding steroids at or below physiologic dosing.\n\nInfusion may be delayed by up to 5 days after completion of LD chemo, without sponsor approval, in the event that these issues resolve in that time frame.\n\nThe above criteria need to be met to start treatment (for both initiation of lymphodepletion and cell infusion).\n\nExclusion Criteria for Leukapheresis for Parts A and B:\n\n* Treatment with an any investigational cellular therapy within 8 weeks prior to apheresis.\n* Any systemic anti-cancer therapy within 1 weeks of leukapheresis excluding steroids (prednisone) at or below physiologic dosing (5mg).\n* Ongoing treatment with chronic immunosuppressants (e.g., cyclosporine or systemic steroids above physiologic dosing). Intermittent topical, inhaled, or intranasal corticosteroids are allowed.\n* Ongoing systemic immunosuppression for acute and/or chronic GVH as a result of previous allogeneic bone marrow transplant and at least 12 weeks out from prior allogeneic SCT.\n* Presence of active CNS disease\n* Significant co-morbid condition or disease which in the judgment of the Principal Investigator would place the subject at undue risk or interfere with the study; examples include, but are not limited to, cirrhotic liver disease, sepsis, and/or recent significant traumatic injury.\n* Active, uncontrolled, systemic bacterial, viral, or fungal infection.\n* Subjects with a history of class III or IV congestive heart failure or with a history of non- ischemic cardiomyopathy.\n* Subjects with unstable angina, myocardial infarction, or ventricular arrhythmia requiring medication or mechanical control within the previous 3 months.\n* Subjects with arterial vascular disease such as history of cerebrovascular accident or peripheral vascular disease requiring therapeutic anti-coagulation.\n* Subjects with history of a new pulmonary embolism (PE) /deep vein thrombosis (DVT) within 6 months of beginning lymphodepletion requiring ongoing anticoagulation.\n* Subjects with second malignancies if the second malignancy has required therapy in the last 3 years or is not in complete remission; exceptions to this criterion include successfully treated non-metastatic basal cell or squamous cell skin carcinoma, or prostate cancer that does not require therapy other than hormonal therapy.\n* Pregnant or lactating women. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because CAR-79b-19 T cell drug product is an agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with CAR-79b-19 T cell drug product, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with CAR-79b-19 T cell drug product.\n* Prior treatment with a construct containing truncated EGFR (tEGFR). Ex: lisocabtagene maraleucel.\n\nAdditional Exclusion Criteria for Leukapheresis for Part B, Arm B.2:\n\n* Prior CD19-directed cellular therapy.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
