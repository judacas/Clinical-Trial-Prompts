    "official_title": "A First-in-Human, Multicenter, Phase 1/2, Open-Label Study of XTX301 in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors",
    "inclusion_criteria": "• Disease Criteria: Part 1A - Any histologically or cytologically confirmed solid tumor malignancy that is locally advanced or metastatic and has failed standard therapy, standard therapy does not confer survival benefit, or standard therapy is not available.\n\nPart 1B- Any histologically or cytologically confirmed solid tumor malignancy among the tumor types outlined below, that is locally advanced or metastatic and has failed standard therapy, standard therapy does not confer survival benefit, or standard therapy is not available. Patients with the following tumor types are eligible for Part 1B: melanoma, NSCLC, HNSCC, TNBC, cervical cancer, microsatellite instability high/mismatch repair deficient (MSI-H/dMMR) colorectal cancer, or MSI-H/dMMR endometrial cancer. Note: Based on evolving internal and external data, the Sponsor may decide to open a \"backfill cohort\" in Part 1B for patients with any of the following solid tumors: prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, microsatellite stable colorectal cancer, T-cell lymphoma.\n\nPhase 2 - All patients must have measurable disease at baseline per RECIST 1.1. Additional disease-specific criteria per cohort are as follows:\n\ni. Cohort 2A: head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Must have histologically or cytologically confirmed locally recurrent or metastatic HNSCC previously treated with 1 to 2 lines of therapy. Unless contraindicated, prior therapy must have included PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor and/or platinum-based chemotherapy per local and institutional standard of care.\n\nii. Cohort 2B: melanoma. Must have unresectable or metastatic melanoma previously treated with 1 to 2 lines of therapy in the recurrent or metastatic setting. Unless contraindicated, prior therapy must have included a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor alone or in combination. Patients with known BRAF V600-activating mutation must have previously received targeted therapy per local and institutional standard of care.\n\niii. Cohort 2C: non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Must have histologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC previously treated with 1 to 2 lines of therapy. Unless contraindicated, prior therapy must have included a PD1/PD-L1 inhibitor and a platinum-based regimen, given either concurrently or separately per local and institutional standard of care. Patients with known genomic alteration for which a targeted therapy is approved (e.g. ROS1 fusion, NTRK fusion, BRAF V600E mutation, EGFR mutation, or ALK fusion) must have been previously treated with relevant targeted therapy per local and institutional standard of care.\n\niv. Cohort 2D: ovarian cancer. Must have histologically confirmed epithelial ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer with current platinum-resistant disease per investigator's assessment (e.g. patient is not eligible for further platinum-containing treatment). Patients must have previously experienced a response lasting at least 180 days to first-line platinum-based therapy. Patients who have been unable to tolerate platinum therapy are also eligible. Unless contraindicated, patients with known BRCA mutation must have received a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor.\n\nv. Cohort 2E: castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Must have metastatic CRPC previously treated with an androgen receptor pathway inhibitor (e.g. abiraterone, enzalutamide, darolutamide, or apalutamide) and/or chemotherapy per local and institutional standard of care. Baseline testosterone must be ≤ 50 ng/dL (≤ 2.0 nM), and surgical or ongoing medical castration must be maintained throughout the duration of the study.\n\nvi. Cohort 2F: triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Must have metastatic TNBC with disease relapse after 2 to 4 previous lines of therapy per local and institutional standard of care. Neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant chemotherapy will count as 1 prior line of therapy. Unless contraindicated, patients with known actionable mutations (e.g. BRCA1 or BRCA2) must have received prior therapy with the corresponding targeted agent per local and institutional standard of care\n\n* ECOG performance status of 0-2\n* Adequate organ function\n* Tumor tissue samples: Part 1B: patients must have lesions amenable to biopsy and be willing and able to provide fresh tumor biopsies before and after initiation of treatment\n* Patients with recent major surgery must have adequately recovered with no ongoing complications from the surgery before receiving study drug\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Prior treatment with IL-12 therapy (any form, e.g. recombinant human, prodrug, intratumoral, etc.)\n* Known liver metastasis based on imaging\n* Possible area of ongoing necrosis (non-disease-related), such as active ulcer, nonhealing wound, or intercurrent bone fracture\n* Active primary central nervous system (CNS) malignancy, CNS metastases, and/or carcinomatous meningitis\n* Active autoimmune disease\n* History of Grade ≥ 3 immune-related adverse events associated with prior immunotherapy unless these were adequately resolved with therapy within 14 days\n* A diagnosis of immunodeficiency; receiving chronic systemic therapy exceeding prednisone 10 mg daily or equivalent or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days before the first dose of study drug\n* Active hepatitis B or active hepatitis C infection\n* Prior treatment with gene therapy, organ transplant, or hematopoietic stem-cell transplant",
