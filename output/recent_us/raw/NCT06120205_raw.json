    "official_title": "Phase I/II Study Exploring the Safety and Efficacy of Combining APL-101 With Frontline Osimertinib in Patients With EGFR-mutated Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Histologically confirmed metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, or locally advanced disease that is not amendable for curative intent therapy, with TKI-sensitive EGFR mutation through CLIA certified lab.\n* Measurable disease by RECIST 1.1 with at least one lesion accessible for core biopsy.\n* Planning to initiate treatment with standard of care osimertinib 80 mg QD. In order to continue treatment with osimertinib + APL-101, patients must have received at least 8 and no more than 16 weeks of SOC osimertinib without disease progression.\n* At least 18 years of age.\n* ECOG performance status ≤ 1\n* Normal bone marrow and organ function as defined below:\n\n  * Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcL\n  * Platelets ≥ 100,000/mcL\n  * Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL (transfused Hgb allowed)\n  * Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dL or ≤ 26 µmol/L\n  * AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤ 2.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (IULN) (≤ 5.0 x IULN if liver metastases)\n  * Creatinine ≤2 x IULN or Creatinine clearance calculated by Cockcroft-Gault formula ≥60 ml/min\n  * Serum calcium (after correcting for albumin level) ≤ IULN\n  * Serum phosphorus ≤ IULN\n* The effects of APL-101 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control, abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she must inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study and for the duration of the study.\n* Ability to understand and willingness to sign an IRB approved written informed consent document (or that of legally authorized representative, if applicable).\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Prior treatment with osimertinib in the metastatic setting (outside of osimertinib given immediately prior to and during the enrollment period). Prior treatment with chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant, or first-line metastatic setting is however allowed.\n* Prior immunotherapy and/or frontline EGFR-directed treatment in the metastatic setting. EGFR directed therapy in the adjuvant setting is permitted, as long as the disease-free interval between completion of adjuvant therapy with EGFR directed therapy and initiation of osimertinib is more than or equal to 1 year.\n* Disease refractory to osimertinib, given immediately prior to and during enrollment period.\n* A history of other malignancy with the exception of:\n\n  * malignancies for which all treatment was completed at least 1 year before registration and the patient has no evidence of disease; or\n  * known indolent malignancies, or malignancies that do not require active treatment and are unlikely not alter the course of treatment of metastatic NSCLC per treating physician.\n* Currently receiving any other investigational agents or herbal medications\n* Presence of symptomatic central nervous system metastases or neurologically unstable CNS symptoms (unable to taper steroids). Patients with treated brain metastases are eligible. Patients with asymptomatic brain metastases prior to initiation of osimertinib will be eligible to receive combination therapy as long as their disease is shown to be responsive to osimertinib.\n* A history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to APL-101, osimertinib, or other agents used in the study.\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, immune deficiencies, hepatitis B, untreated hepatitis C, uncontrolled diabetes, uncontrolled hypertension, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, myocardial infraction within the past 6 months, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, or prolonged QTc interval > 450 ms.\n* Uncontrolled or symptomatic pleural or pericardial effusion. Effusion controlled by presence of an indwelling pleural catheter is not exclusionary.\n* Decompensated heart failure or heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (<50%)\n* Major surgery within 30 days prior to first day of study treatment (osimertinib + APL-101).\n* Poorly controlled diarrheal or gastrointestinal disorders (grade 2 or higher diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting at baseline).\n* Pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 14 days of study entry.\n* Unresolved grade 2 or higher treatment-related toxicities (with the exception of endocrine abnormalities as a result of immunotherapies that are being managed with hormonal supplementation). However, if the treating physician is under the impression that the toxicity under question is unlikely to affect study participation, patient eligibility can be discussed with the PI on a subject by subject basis. After enrollment to this study, osimertinib-related toxicities must resolve to ≤ grade 1 before patient may begin combination therapy.\n* Presence of interstitial lung disease",
