    "official_title": "A Phase II Randomized Study of Sipuleucel-T With or Without Continuing New Hormonal Agents (NHA) in Metastatic Prostate Cancer With PSA Progression While on NHA and LHRH Analog",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic metastatic prostate cancer, and the diagnosis of prostate cancer needs to be histologically confirmed by biopsy of the prostate or a metastatic lesion\n* On combined ADT with LHRH analog and a NHA (enzalutamide, apalutamide or abiraterone) for metastatic prostate cancer with PSA progression, but no imaging progression based on the prostate cancer working group (PCWG) 3 criteria\n* Age 18 or above\n* ECOG performance status 0 or 1\n* Participants must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:\n* Absolute neutrophil count ≥1,000/mcL\n* Platelets ≥100,000/mcL\n* Hemoglobin > 10 g/dl\n* AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤3 × institutional ULN\n* Creatinine 1.5 ≤ institutional ULN\n* Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected participants on effective anti-retroviral therapy with undetectable viral load within 6 months are eligible for this trial.\n* For participants with evidence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, the HBV viral load must be undetectable on suppressive therapy, if indicated\n* Participants with a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection must have been treated and cured. For participants with HCV infection who are currently on treatment, they are eligible if they have an undetectable HCV viral load\n* Participants with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of sipuleucel-T are eligible for this trial\n* No uncontrolled arrhythmia: patients with h/o myocardial infarction or history of congestive heart failure, need to have estimated left ventricle ejection fraction above 40% either on echocardiogram or MUGA scan within 6 months of study enrollment\n* Non-sterilized men who are sexually active with a female partner of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study enrollment, and for the duration of study participation\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be MALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Participants who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to entering the study\n* Prior treatment with sipuleucel-T\n* Participants who have not recovered from adverse events (AEs) due to prior anti-cancer therapy (i.e., have residual toxicities > Grade 2).\n* Participants who require > 50% dose reduction of NHA are excluded from the study except for taking abiraterone at 250 mg with low fat food\n* Documented brain metastases or liver metastases\n* Treatment with any investigational compound within 30 days prior to the first dose of Sipuleucel-T\n* Documented brain metastases or liver metastases\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements\n* Known history of testing positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or known acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. HIV-positive participants on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for sipluleucel-T to be less clinically active in this population\n* Inability to comply with protocol requirements",
