    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Archival or biopsy tumor shows TF IHC membrane or cytosolic score of zero, no TF-positive expression or no TF-positive staining in Part B patients.\n2. Toxicities (except alopecia & fatigue) due to prior antitumor therapy are greater than CTCAE v5.0 Grade 1.\n3. Toxicities due to prior radiotherapy that have not resolved to Grade ≤ 1 CTCAE v5.0 at least 21 days prior to the first treatment.\n4. Untreated, unstable or uncontrolled central nervous system (CNS) metastases.\n5. Any other type of anti-cancer therapy within 21 days of the first dose of study treatment. Use of any other type of anti-cancer treatment is prohibited throughout the study.\n6. Patients with increased bleeding risk.\n7. Presence of severe cardiac dysfunction.\n8. Pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis within 3 months prior to the first dose of study drug.\n9. Concurrent malignancy within 5 years prior to entry.\n10.

Major surgery within 4 weeks of the first dose of study treatment and not fully recovered. Minor surgery within 2 weeks prior to study treatment.\n14. Known allergic reactions to any component or excipient of MRG004A or known allergic reactions to other prior anti-TF (including investigational) or other monoclonal antibody ≥ Grade 3.\n15. Patients who have any known liver disease, including chronic hepatitis B, hepatitis C, autoimmune hepatic disorders, primary biliary cirrhosis or sclerosing cholangitis; Patients who have concurrent, serious, uncontrolled infections or known infection with HIV, or have a diagnosed acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS); or an uncontrolled autoimmune disease, or have undergone organ transplant.\n16. Active uncontrolled bacterial, viral, fungal, rickettsial, or parasitic infection.\n17. Use of systemic corticosteroids within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of treatment.\n18. Use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers with MRG004A.\n19. Other excluded medications or treatment: therapeutic anti-coagulative, or long-term anti-platelet treatment; multivitamins, calcium, vitamin D, and prophylactic anti-RANKL (denosumab) and zoledronic acid therapies for bone metastases are allowed.\n20. Any patient with a positive pregnancy or is breast-feeding.\n21. Any severe and/or uncontrolled systemic disease that at the discretion of investigator and sponsor makes it undesirable for the patient to participate in this study.",
