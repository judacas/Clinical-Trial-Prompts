    "inclusion_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria Include:\n\n1. Patient is male or female aged ≥18 years.\n2. Patient provided signed and dated informed consent prior to initiation of any study procedures.\n3. Patient has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 (fully active, able to carry out all pre-disease activities without restriction) or 1 (unable to perform physically strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to carry out work of a light or sedentary nature).\n4. Patient has a predicted life expectancy of ≥3 months.\n5. Dose escalation cohorts only: Patient has adequate renal function (creatinine ≤1.5 × the upper limit of normal [ULN]) or a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of ≥50 mL/min/1.73 m^2). Expansion cohort only: Patient has a GFR of ≥30 mL/min/1.73 m^2.\n6. Patient has adequate hepatic function, as evidenced by a total bilirubin ≤1.5 × ULN, aspartate transaminase (AST), and /or alanine transaminase (ALT) ≤3 × ULN or ≤5 ×ULN, if due to liver involvement by tumor.\n7. Patient has adequate bone marrow function, as evidenced by hemoglobin ≥9.0 g/dL in the absence of transfusion within the previous 72 hours, platelet count ≥100×10^9cells/L, and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1.5×10^9 cells/L.\n8. Patient has no significant ischemic heart disease or myocardial infarction (MI) within 6 months before the first dose of CPX-POM and currently has adequate cardiac function, as evidenced by a left ventricular ejection fraction of >50% as assessed by multi-gated acquisition (MUGA) or ultrasound/echocardiography (ECHO); and corrected QT interval (QTc) <470 msec by Fridericia (QTcF). The eligibility of patients with ventricular pacemakers for whom the QT interval may not be accurately measurable will be determined on a case-by-case basis by the Sponsor in consultation with the Medical Monitor.\n9. Patient and his/her partner agree to use adequate contraception after providing written informed consent through 3 months after the last dose of CPX-POM, as follows:\n\n   1. For women: Negative pregnancy test during Screening and at Day 1 of each treatment cycle and compliant with a medically-approved contraceptive regimen during and for 3 months after the treatment period or documented to be surgically sterile or postmenopausal.\n   2. For men: Compliant with a medically-approved contraceptive regimen during and for 3 months after the treatment period or documented to be surgically sterile. Men whose sexual partners are of child-bearing potential must agree to use 2 methods of contraception prior to study entry, during the study, and for 3 months after the treatment period.\n10. Patient is willing and able to participate in the study and comply with all study requirements.\n\nExclusion Criteria Include:\n\nPatients who meet any of the following exclusion criteria are not to be enrolled in this study\n\n1. Patient has a history of risk factors for torsade de pointes (e.g., heart failure, hypokalemia, family history of long QT syndrome) or requires the use of concomitant medications that prolong the QT/QTc interval during study participation. Patients should not receive anti-emetic medications before and following Dose 1 of Cycle 1 for each treatment cohort. However, anti-emetics such as ondansetron or granisetron that have a mild QTc prolonging effect are allowed starting with Dose 2 of Cycle 1, if used with caution and attention to the approved labelling.\n2. Patient has an abnormal cardiac appearance/heart size, as evidenced by chest X-ray or computed tomography (CT) scan.\n3. Patient has an uncontrolled or severe intercurrent medical condition (including uncontrolled brain metastases). Patients with stable brain metastases either treated or being treated with a stable dose of steroids/anticonvulsants, with no dose change within 4 weeks before the first dose of CPX-POM and no anticipated dose change, are allowed. The decision to exclude a patient from the study for an uncontrolled or severe intercurrent medical condition will be made by the Principal Investigator. Examples could include epilepsy, resistant infection, or any other neurological disease that would make clinical assessment difficult.\n4. Patient underwent major surgery within 4 weeks before the first dose of CPX-POM or received cancer-directed therapy (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormonal therapy, biologic or immunotherapy, etc.) or an drug or device within 4 weeks (6 weeks for mitomycin C and nitrosoureas) or 5 half-lives of that agent (whichever is shorter) before the first dose of CPX-POM. A minimum of 10 days between termination of the investigational drug and administration of CPX-POM is required. In addition, any drug-related toxicity, with the exception of alopecia, should have recovered to ≤Grade 1.\n5. If female, patient is pregnant or breast-feeding.\n6. Patient has evidence of a serious active infection (e.g., infection requiring treatment with intravenous antibiotics).\n7. Patient has active Hepatitis A infection.\n8. Patient known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or Hepatitis B or C infection, as such patients may be at increased risk for toxicity due to concomitant treatment and disease-related symptoms may preclude accurate assessment of the safety of CPX POM.\n9. Patient has an important medical illness or abnormal laboratory finding that, in the Investigator's opinion, would increase the risk of participating in this study.\n10. Patient is taking warfarin.\n11. Patient has a history of other malignancy treated with curative intent within the previous 5 years with the exception of adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix. Patients with previous invasive cancers are eligible if the treatment was completed more than 5 years prior to initiating current study treatment, and there is no evidence of recurrent disease.\n12. Patient has known allergy or hypersensitivity to components of CPX-POM.\n13. Patient is taking any iron replacement therapy administered IV, IM, or orally due to the potential for loss of anticancer activity due to drug and metabolites chelating iron.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
