Representative formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor specimens in paraffin blocks (blocks are preferred) or at least 4 unstained slides, with an associated pathology report, for testing of tumor PD-L1 expression (tumor tissue from bone metastases is not evaluable for PD-L1 expression and is therefore not acceptable). b. Tumor tissue should be of good quality based on total and viable tumor content. Fine needle aspiration, brushing, cell pellet from pleural effusion, bone metastases, and lavage samples are not acceptable. For core-needle biopsy specimens, at least three cores should be submitted for evaluation. c.

Women of non-childbearing potential may be included without serum pregnancy test if they are either surgically sterile or have been postmenopausal for >= 1 year\n* Fertile men and women must use an effective method of contraception during treatment and for at least 6 months after completion of treatment as directed by their physician. Effective methods of contraception are defined as those that result in a low failure rate (i.e., less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly (e.g., implants, injectables, combined oral contraception or intra-uterine devices). At the discretion of the Investigator, acceptable methods of contraception may include total abstinence in cases where the lifestyle of the patient ensures compliance. (Periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post ovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception)\n* For individual baskets:\n\n  * Appendiceal adenocarcinoma\n\n    * Not considered candidate for curative surgery\n  * Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma\n\n    * Patients with either metastatic or locally advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma that are technically resectable but in whom surgery is expected to lead to substantial function impairment or disfigurement are eligible\n  * Small bowel adenocarcinoma\n\n    * Must be refractory or intolerant to at least one line of fluorouracil (5FU)-based chemotherapy for metastatic disease\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
