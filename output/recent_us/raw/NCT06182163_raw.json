    "official_title": "Phase II Randomized Controlled Trial of Biologically Guided Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy in Oligoprogressive Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, Melanoma, and Renal Cell Carcinoma",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Documented informed consent of the participant and/or legally authorized representative\n\n  * Assent, when appropriate, will be obtained per institutional guidelines\n* Agreement to allow the use of archival tissue from diagnostic tumor biopsies\n\n  * If unavailable, exceptions may be granted with study principal investigator (PI) approval\n* Age: >= 18 years\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) =< 2\n* Histologically or cytologically confirmed NSCLC with 1-5 sites of disease progression while on or following systemic therapy with a checkpoint inhibitor with or without chemotherapy for at least 3 months with radiographic evidence of progression based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) or Positron Emission Tomography Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (PERCIST)\n* Lesion(s) must all be amenable to SBRT which will be determined by the radiation oncologists. Active lesions should be a minimum size of >= 1 cm\n* Primary tumor should be controlled for > 3 months in the metachronous setting; for synchronouos progression of the primary and oligoprogressive site(s), the primary should be treated with curative/local control intent\n* Patients eligible for the study must have at least one lesion for which the planned radiation dose achieves a biologic effective dose (BED) < 100 (alpha/beta = 10) due to organs at risk and dose constraints\n* If the clinical scenario deem that other forms of local therapy may be more suitable for the metastatic disease, such as surgical resection and interventional radiology-guided ablation, patients would be able to undergo other forms of local therapy after discussion with the study PI but at least one lesion must be treated with SBRT in this scenario\n* Patients with brain metastases can be included but brain metastases must be treated prior to enrollment and are not considered as a site of oligoprogression\n* Life expectancy >= 3 months in the opinion of the treating investigators\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Judgement by the investigator that the patient is unsuitable to participate in the study and the patient is unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions, and requirements\n* Those not eligible for SBRT after review by a radiation oncologist\n* Unable to undergo a Pet/CT or do not have Pet active disease\n* Pregnant and/or breastfeeding women are excluded from this study as these agents may have the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Female patients of childbearing potentially must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to receiving therapy\n* Prospective participants who, in the opinion of the investigator, may not be able to comply with all study procedures (including compliance issues related to feasibility/logistics)",
