    "exclusion_criteria": "* Untreated brain or meningeal metastases (i.e., subjects with history of metastases are eligible provided they do not require ongoing steroid treatment and have shown clinical and radiographic stability for at least 28 days after definitive therapy)\n* Unresolved Grade 2 or higher toxicities related to previous anticancer therapy except alopecia.\n* Unresolved Grade 2 or higher peripheral neuropathy.\n* History of hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.\n* Recent history (within 6 months) of congestive heart failure (defined as New York Heart Association, Class 2 or higher), ischemic cardiovascular event, pericarditis, or clinically significant pericardial effusion or arrythmia.\n* Recent history (within 6 months) of Childs-Pugh B or C classification of liver disease.\n* History of clinically significant medical and/or psychiatric conditions or any other reason that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with the subject's participation in this study or would make the subject an unsuitable candidate to receive study drug.\n* History of uncontrolled, clinically significant endocrinopathy.\n* Known gastrointestinal disorders making absorption of oral medications problematic; subject must be able to swallow capsules.\n* If treated with a PD-1/aPD-L1 targeting or other immune-oncology agents in the past, excluded if had prior pneumonitis, prior Grade 3 or higher immune mediated toxicity, hypersensitivity to administered drug or drug related toxicity requiring discontinuation.\n* Active autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment in past 2-years (exceptions for endocrinopathies, vitiligo or atopic conditions).\n* History of solid organ transplant or allogeneic stem cell transplant.\n* History of other malignancy, with the following exceptions:\n\n  * No known active disease present within >= 3 years before first dose of study treatment and felt to be at low recurrence by investigator.\n  * Adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer or lentigo maligna without evidence of disease.\n  * Adequately treated carcinoma in situ without evidence of disease.\n* History of interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis.\n* Major surgery <= 28 days prior to first dose of study drug\n* Known active severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection per local testing practices.",
