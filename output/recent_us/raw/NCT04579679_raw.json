Assent, when appropriate, will be obtained according to institutional guidelines.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 12 Months\nMust have maximum age of 21 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "Diagnosis: patients with a diagnosis of oligodendroglioma or oligoastrocytoma are not eligible.

Pregnancy tests must be obtained in girls who are post-menarchal. Males or females of reproductive potential may not participate unless they have agreed to use an effective contraceptive method.\n\n   Patients of childbearing or child fathering potential must agree to use adequate contraceptive methods (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) while being treated on this study and for 3 months after completing therapy.
