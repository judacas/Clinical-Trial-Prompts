If the contraception requirements in the local label for any of the study interventions is more stringent than the requirement above, the local label requirements are to be followed.\n* Has provided tumor tissue from a fresh core or excisional biopsy (obtained within 12 months of screening) from soft tissue not previously irradiated.
