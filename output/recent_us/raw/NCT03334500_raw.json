    "exclusion_criteria": "* DCIS presentation as a palpable mass\n* Exogenous sex steroid use within 4 weeks prior to core needle biopsy\n* Prior ipsilateral breast cancer radiotherapy will be excluded; prior contralateral breast cancer therapy within 2 years will also be excluded\n* Skin lesions on the breast that disrupt the stratum corneum (eg eczema, ulceration)\n* History of endometrial neoplasia\n* History of thromboembolic disease (history of varicose veins and superficial phlebitis is allowed)\n* Current smokers\n* Current users of potent inhibitors of tamoxifen metabolism must be able to discontinue their use and switch to an alternative medication for the duration of participation, under the advice of their physician; if the physician feels that an alternative medication is not appropriate for the subject and the current medication is medically necessary, the subject will not be eligible; the drugs are listed below; many of these are not in clinical use at the moment; bupropion, celecoxib, chlorpheniramine, chlorpromazine, cimetidine, citalopram, clemastine, clomipramine, clozapine, cocaine, delavirdine, desipramine, diphenhydramine, doxepin, duloxetine, escitalopram, fluoxetine, haloperidol, halofantrine, hydroxyzine, imipramine, isoniazid, ketoconazole, methadone, methimazole, mibefradil, miconazole, nicardipine, paroxetine, pergolide, perphenazine, pioglitazone, pyrimethamine, quinidine, quinine, ranitidine, ritonavir, ropinirole, sertraline, terbinafine, thioridazine, ticlopidine, tranylcypromine, trazodone, tripelennamine\n* Prior use of SERMS or AIs including tamoxifen, raloxifene, anastrozole, letrozole, or exemestane for prevention or therapy within 5 years\n* Participants may not be receiving any other investigational agents within 30 days of enrollment or during this study\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to tamoxifen or compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study; breastfeeding should be discontinued by nursing mothers who agree to participate in the study\n* Men are excluded from this study since DCIS of the breast is exceedingly rare in men, and there are no data regarding skin penetration of 4-OHT though male chest wall skin (which is thicker and hairier than female chest wall skin)",
