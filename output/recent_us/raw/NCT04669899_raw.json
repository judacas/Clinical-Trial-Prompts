Subject has acceptable liver function at Screening, as evidenced by:\n\n   1. Bilirubin < 1.5 x ULN (upper limit of normal)\n   2. AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) < 3.0 x ULN (upper limit of normal)\n   3. Alkaline Phosphatase < 2.5 x ULN (upper limit of normal)\n6. Subject has a Serum Creatinine < 1.5 x ULN (upper limit of normal)\n7. Subject has acceptable hematologic status at Screening, as evidenced by:\n\n   1. Absolute neutrophil count > 1,500 cells/mm3; > 1.5 x 109/L, and\n   2. Platelet count > 75,000/mm3; > 75.0 x 109/L, and\n   3. Hemoglobin (HGB) ≥ 8.0 g/dL; ≥ 5.6 mmol/L\n8. Subject has an INR < 1.5\n9. Female subjects of childbearing potential (i.e., women who have not been surgically sterilized or have not been post-menopausal for at least one year), and male subjects with partners of childbearing potential, must agree to use medically acceptable methods of contraception beginning on Study Day 1 and continuing until at least four weeks after administration of the subject's final dose of AdAPT-001. Medically acceptable contraception is defined as either: 1) usage by at least one of the partners of a barrier method of contraception, together with usage by the female partner, commencing at least three months prior to Study Day 1, of a stable regimen of any form of hormonal contraception or an intra-uterine device, or 2) usage by the couple of a double-barrier method of contraception.

    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Presence of a serious co-morbid medical condition, or a clinically significant laboratory finding(s) that, in the opinion of the Investigator, suggests the presence of an infectious, endocrine, and/or other inadequately treated systemic disorder.\n2. A known uncontrolled active bacterial, fungal, or viral infection. No subject with an active SARS-CoV-2 infection (within 14 days of a positive test)\n3. Known positive history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) test\n4. Subjects who have active hepatitis.\n5. If female, subject is pregnant and/or breastfeeding.\n6. Subjects with active autoimmune disease or history of autoimmune disease that might recur and may affect vital organ function or require immune suppressive treatment including systemic corticosteroids, should be excluded.\n\n   Note: Subjects in any condition requiring systemic treatment with corticosteroids (prednisone > 10 mg/day or equivalent of the similar drug) or other immunosuppressive agents within 14 days before AdAPT-001), but currently or previously treated with any of the following steroid regimens were included: Topical, ophthalmic, intra-articular, intranasal, or inhaled corticosteroids with minimal systemic absorption; prophylactic short-term use of corticosteroids.\n7. Prior adenoviral therapy for any indication except vaccination against infectious disease. Subjects receiving COVID-19 or live vaccination, cannot start treatment until 7 days after completing the vaccination. Recommend waiting at least 28 days from AdAPT-001 dose prior to receiving COVID-19 vaccination. Concurrent treatment with Evusheld is allowed.\n8.
