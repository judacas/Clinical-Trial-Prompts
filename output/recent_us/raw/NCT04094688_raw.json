    "exclusion_criteria": "* Active connective tissue disorders, such as lupus or scleroderma requiring flare therapy\n* Current use of systemic chemotherapy, endocrine therapy or HER2-neu targeted therapy\n* Any lesion >5 cm in greatest diameter.\n* Inability to obtain histologic proof of metastatic breast cancer\n* Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy (in dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug.\n* Has a known additional malignancy (second primary) that is progressing or has required active treatment within the past 3 years. Note: Participants with basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or carcinoma in situ (e.g. cervical cancer in situ) that have undergone potentially curative therapy are not excluded.\n* Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment.\n* Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.
