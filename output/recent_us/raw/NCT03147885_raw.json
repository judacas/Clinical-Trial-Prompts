Hepatitis C screening tests are not required unless:\n* Known history of HCV infection\n* As mandated by local health authority Note: Participants must have completed curative anti-viral therapy at least 4 weeks prior to randomization\n\n  • Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected participants must have well-controlled HIV on antiretroviral therapy (ART), defined as:\n* Participants on ART must have a CD4+ T-cell count >= 350 cells/mm^3 at the time of screening\n* Participants on ART must have achieved and maintained virologic suppression defined as confirmed HIV ribonucleic acid (RNA) level below 50 or the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) (below the limit of detection) using the locally available assay at the time of screening and for at least 12 weeks before screening\n* It is advised that participants must not have had any acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining opportunistic infections within the past 12 months.\n* Participants on ART must have been on a stable regimen, without changes in drugs or dose modification, for at least 4 weeks before study entry (day 1) and agree to continue ART throughout the study\n* The combination ART regimen must not contain any antiretroviral medications that interact with CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers/substrates (https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-interactions-labeling/drug-development-and-drug-interactions-table-substrates-inhibitors-and-inducers)\n\n  * Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >= 1500/uL (specimens must be collected within 10 days prior to the start of study intervention)\n  * Platelets >= 100000/uL (specimens must be collected within 10 days prior to the start of study intervention)\n  * Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL or ≥ 5.6 mmol/L (specimens must be collected within 10 days prior to the start of study intervention)\n* Criteria must be met without erythropoietin dependency and without packed red blood cell (pRBC) transfusion within last 2 weeks\n\n  • Creatinine or measured or calculated creatinine clearance (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] can also be used in place of creatinine or creatinine Clearance [CrCl]) =< 1.5 X upper limit of normal (ULN) or >= 30 mL/min for participant with creatinine levels > 1.5 X institutional ULN (specimens must be collected within 10 days prior to the start of study intervention)\n* Creatinine clearance (CrCl) should be calculated per institutional standard\n\n  * Total bilirubin =< 1.5 X ULN or direct bilirubin =< ULN for participants with total bilirubin levels > 1.5 X ULN (specimens must be collected within 10 days prior to the start of study intervention)\n  * Alanine aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase [SGOT]) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase [SGPT]) =< 2.5 X ULN (specimens must be collected within 10 days prior to the start of study intervention)\n  * International normalized ratio (INR) or prothrombin time (PT) activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) =< 1.5 X ULN unless participant is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or aPTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants (specimens must be collected within 10 days prior to the start of study intervention)\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent or with an agent directed to another stimulatory or co-inhibitory T-cell receptor (eg, CTLA-4, OX-40, CD137)\n* Has received prior systemic anti-cancer therapy including investigational agents within 4 weeks prior to allocation\n* Has received prior radiotherapy within 2 weeks of start of study intervention.
