This includes, but is not limited to, patients with galactose intolerance, a congenital lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption.\n* Malignancies other than NSCLC within 5 years prior to enrollment, except for curatively treated basal cell carcinoma of the skin, early gastrointestinal (GI) cancer by endoscopic resection, in situ carcinoma of the cervix, ductal carcinoma in situ, papillary thyroid cancer, or any cured cancer that is considered to have no impact on disease free survival or overall survival for the current NSCLC\n* Any GI disorder that may affect absorption of oral medications, such as malabsorption syndrome or status post-major bowel resection\n* Liver disease characterized by aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase >= 3 × upper limit of normal or impaired excretory function or synthetic function or other conditions of decompensated liver disease such as coagulopathy, hepatic encephalopathy, hypoalbuminemia, ascites, or bleeding from esophageal varices or active viral or active autoimmune, alcoholic, or other types of acute hepatitis\n* Japanese patients participating in the serial/intensive PK sample collection only: administration of strong/potent CYP450 3A inhibitors or inducers within 14 days prior to the first dose of study treatment and while on treatment with alectinib up to Week 3\n* Any exclusion criteria based on the local labels or guidelines for chemotherapy regimen\n* Patients with symptomatic bradycardia\n* History of organ transplant\n* Known HIV positivity or AIDS-related illness\n* Any clinically significant concomitant disease or condition that could interfere with-or for which the treatment might interfere with the conduct of the study or the absorption of oral medications or that would pose an unacceptable risk to the patients in this study, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator\n* Any psychological, familial, sociological, or geographical condition potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol requirements and/or follow-up procedures; those conditions should be discussed with the patient before trial entry\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
