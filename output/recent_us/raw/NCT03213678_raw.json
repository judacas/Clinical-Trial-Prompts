Participants with HIV are eligible if:\n\n  1. They have received established antiretroviral therapy (ART) for at least 4 weeks prior to randomization\n  2. They continue on ART as clinically indicated while enrolled on study\n  3. CD4 counts and viral load are monitored per standard of care by a local health care provider\n  4.

HIV-positive participants must be excluded where mandated locally\n* Serious or uncontrolled medical disorders including for example, active severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SAR-CoV-2) infection within approximately 4 weeks prior to screening. In the case of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, acute symptoms must have resolved based on investigator clinical judgment and, in consultation with Medical Monitor, there are no sequelae that would place the participant at a higher risk of receiving investigational treatment to be eligible\n* Prior treatment with an programmed death receptor-1 (anti-PD-1), programmed death ligand-1 (anti-PD-L1), or cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (anti-CTLA-4) antibody, or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell costimulation or checkpoint pathways\n* Treatment with any live attenuated vaccine within 30 days of first study treatment\n\nOther protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria apply",
