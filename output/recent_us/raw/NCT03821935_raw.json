Diagnosis can be any time in the six months prior to registration/randomization\n* Participants >= 18 years will be enrolled. Because no dosing or adverse event (AE) data are currently available on the use of urolithin A in participants < 18 years of age, children and adolescents are excluded from this study\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =< 2 (Karnofsky >= 60%)\n* Absolute neutrophil count >= 1,000/microliter\n* Platelets >= 100,000/microliter\n* Total bilirubin =< 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) Note: Higher total bilirubin levels (=< 3 mg/dL) can be allowed if due to known benign liver condition, i.e. Gilbert's\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT]) =< 3.0 x institutional upper limit of normal\n* Creatinine =< 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal\n* Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected participants on effective anti-retroviral therapy with undetectable viral load within 6 months are eligible for this trial\n* For participants with evidence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, the HBV viral load must be undetectable on suppressive therapy, if indicated\n* Participants with a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection must have been treated and cured. For patients with HCV infection who are currently on treatment, they are eligible if they have an undetectable HCV viral load\n* Participants on chronic suppressive antiviral therapy for herpes simplex virus (HSV) are eligible\n* Scheduled to undergo RP in the next 3-6 weeks\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be MALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
