    "inclusion_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria for Participants with MG:\n\n* Age 18 or older\n* Diagnosed with Generalized Myasthenia Gravis (gMG) via seropositive test for acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibodies or seronegative test with clinical symptoms consistent with gMG\n* On stable MG therapy for at least 1 month\n* Ability to stand for approximately 15 minutes continuously with or without an assistive device (i.e. the length of time to stand to take a shower, complete meal preparation, wait in line at the bank, etc.)\n* Score of 1 (Mild) or 2 (Moderate) on at least one side of the \"arm outstretched\" and \"leg outstretched\" items of the QMG, demonstrating fatigability\n* At least some anti-gravity strength in major muscle groups as assessed by manual muscle testing (i.e. 2+/5 strength or better)\n* Medical clearance to participate in an exercise program\n* Ability to provide informed consent\n* Ability to conform to the requirements of the study (i.e. attendance at assessment and intervention visits, maintain current level of non-study physical activity for the duration of the study, no intention to relocate mid-study)\n\nExclusion Criteria for Participants with MG:\n\n* Concurrent participation in another interventional research study\n* Unable to tolerate 15 minutes of continuous standing with or without an assistive device\n* Regular participation in strength training (2x per week or more over the past 6 months)\n* Score of 0 (None) on all \"arm outstretched\" and \"leg outstretched\" items of the QMG\n* Presence of a pacemaker, metal implants, or other implanted medical devices that could impact participant safety during WB-EMS intervention\n* Presence of unstable acute or chronic disease (i.e. renal failure, rheumatologic disease, cardia arrhythmia, neoplasm, uncontrolled hypertension)\n* Known pregnancy at time of screening\n* Presence of a terminal disease (i.e. receiving hospice services)\n* Current or previous use of any drugs known to influence muscle mass or performance within 6 months; these may include but are not limited to anabolic steroids, IGF01, growth hormone, replacement androgen therapy, anti-androgen therapy\n* Presence of an additional neuromuscular or neurologic condition affecting somatosensory or motor function/control (i.e. motor neuron disease, muscle disease, peripheral neuropathy, other NMJ condition, Parkinson's disease, Multiple Sclerosis, h/o stroke, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, ataxia, apraxia, hemiplegia, etc.)\n* Musculoskeletal condition or surgery in the past year that would confound results of exercise interventions (i.e. knee replacement, hip replacement, rotator cuff repair, spinal fusion)\n* Other medical conditions, signs, or symptoms that would interfere with study conduct or interpretation of results as determined by an investigator\n\nInclusion Criteria for Healthy Controls:\n\n* Age 18-39 years\n* Ability to provide informed consent\n\nExclusion Criteria for Healthy Controls:\n\n* Concurrent participation in an interventional research study\n* Presence of unstable acute or chronic disease (i.e. renal failure, rheumatologic disease, cardia arrhythmia, neoplasm, uncontrolled hypertension)\n* Presence of a terminal disease (i.e. receiving hospice services)\n* Current or previous use of any drugs known to influence muscle mass or performance within 6 months; these may include but are not limited to anabolic steroids, IGF01, growth hormone, replacement androgen therapy, anti-androgen therapy\n* Presence of an additional neuromuscular or neurologic condition affecting somatosensory or motor function/control (i.e. motor neuron disease, muscle disease, peripheral neuropathy, other NMJ condition, Parkinson's disease, Multiple Sclerosis, h/o stroke, TBI, SCI, ataxia, apraxia, hemiplegia, etc.)\n* Musculoskeletal condition or surgery in the past year that would confound results of exercise interventions (i.e. TKA, THA, RTC repair, spinal fusion)\n* Other medical conditions, signs, or symptoms that would interfere with study conduct or interpretation of results as determined by an investigator\n\nHealthy controls will complete dEMG testing only during a one-time session.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
