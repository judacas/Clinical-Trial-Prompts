Patients with life expectancy ≥3 months;\n6. Patients with at least one measurable lesion by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), according to RECIST v1.1. Tumor lesions that have been irradiated ≥4 weeks before the start of treatment, and have subsequently had documented progression, may be chosen as target lesions in the absence of measurable lesions that have not been irradiated;\n7. Patients whose laboratory data at screening meet the acceptable criteria for bone marrow, liver function and renal function.\n8. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative urine pregnancy test during screening. A woman is considered of childbearing potential (fertile) following menarche and until becoming postmenopausal unless permanently sterile. A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. Postmenopausal women can be included;\n9. Male patients with female partners of childbearing potential and female patients of childbearing potential are required to use two forms of acceptable contraception, including one barrier method, during their participation in the study and for 3 months following last dose. Medically acceptable contraception includes:\n\n   * Hormonal methods (Needs to have been instituted at least 1 month prior to the first dose of study drug):\n   * Barrier methods:\n   * Abstinence, defined as refraining from sexual intercourse\n10. Male patients must also refrain from donating sperm from the first dose of study drug until 4 months after the last dose of study drug;\n11. Patients must be able to swallow and retain orally administered medication.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",

History or evidence of any severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions or other conditions that, in the opinion of the Investigator and Sponsor, could affect the patient's participation in the study, such as any disorder or surgical procedure that could impact the absorption of study drug from the gastrointestinal tract.\n8.

Patients who have impaired cardiac function or clinically significant cardiac diseases, including any of the following:\n\n   * Congenital long QT syndrome;\n   * Significant ventricular or supraventricular arrhythmias (patients with sinus arrhythmia or chronic rate-controlled atrial fibrillation in the absence of other cardiac abnormalities are eligible);\n   * LVEF < 50% by ECHO or MUGA;\n   * Other clinically significant heart disease such as known congestive heart failure New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III-IV;\n10. Patients with QT interval ≥470 msec in females and ≥450 msec in males at screening using Fridericia's formula (determined as the mean of 3 QTcF values from the screening triplicate ECG obtained with adequate quality);\n11. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.\n12. WOCBP and sexually active fertile men with WOCBP partners who are unwilling or unable to use acceptable contraception method to avoid pregnancy for at least 1 month before the first dose of the study drug, during the study, and for 4 months after the last dose of study drug;\n13. Male patient who plans to father a child while enrolled in this study or within 4 months after the last dose of study drug;\n14. Not recovered from toxicity from prior anticancer therapy to baseline or Grade 1 (except toxicities which are not clinically significant such as alopecia, skin discoloration).\n15. History of an allogeneic bone marrow or solid organ transplant;\n16. Use of systemic anti-cancer agent (except luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists, bisphosphonates and denosumab) or investigational drug ≤28 days or five half-lives whichever is shorter prior to the first dose of study treatment;\n17. Radiation therapy ≤28 days prior to the first dose of study treatment, or likely to require radiation therapy at any time until the 30 days after the last dose of study treatment, except for palliative radiation therapy limited to non-target bone lesions;\n18.
