Subjects with ALCL must have had prior exposure to anti CD30 antibody as part of their prior treatment regimen.\n6. Have provided archival tumor tissue sample or newly obtained core or excisional biopsy of a tumor lesion (lymph node or extra-nodal infiltration of a tissue for NHL subjects, bone marrow aspirate and biopsy for MM subjects) and for Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) subjects [if applicable], not previously irradiated.\n7.
