    "exclusion_criteria": "* Subject is currently participating in or has participated in a study of an investigational agent or using an investigational device within 4 weeks of the first dose of treatment.\n* Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy (>10 mg/day prednisone, or equivalent) or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment. Inhaled or topical steroids are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease\n* Prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or biological therapy, within 2 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to a previously administered agent (exc. alopecia).\n* If subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately prior to starting therapy.\n* Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.\n* Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or in situ cervical cancer that has undergone potentially curative therapy.\n* Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least four weeks prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using steroids for at least 7 days prior to trial treatment.\n* Has an active, known or suspected autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment within the past 3 months or a documented history of clinically severe autoimmune disease, or a syndrome that requires systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents. Subjects with vitiligo or resolved childhood asthma/atopy, type 1 diabetes mellitus are permitted. Subjects that require intermittent use of bronchodilators or local steroid injections would not be excluded from the study. Subjects with hypothyroidism stable on hormone replacement or Sjogren's syndrome will not be excluded from the study.\n* Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy\n* Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's participation for the full duration of the trial, or it is not in the best interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.\n* Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial.\n* Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit through 5 months for females, 7 months for males after the last dose of trial treatment.\n* Prior anti-PD-1, anti-PDL-1, anti-PDL-2, anti-Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) antibody or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation or checkpoint pathways.\n* Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).\n* Has known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA [qualitative] is detected).\n* Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment.\n* Subject is a prisoners, or compulsory detained",
