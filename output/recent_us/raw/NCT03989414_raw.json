    "exclusion_criteria": "* Participants must not have a known positive serology for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Encorafenib is contraindicated with concomitant use of non-nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors like efavirenz and etravirine. In addition, it is recommended in the investigator brochure of encorafenib to avoid using encorafenib with protease inhibitors. Therefore, because all participants on this study would receive encorafenib for either randomized arm of treatment, participants with HIV who receive these components of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) would be at high risk for complications of drug-drug interaction\n* Participants must not have had prior treatment with a BRAF inhibitor (including, but not limited to, encorafenib, dabrafenib, or vemurafenib), MEK inhibitor (including, but not limited to, trametinib, selumetinib, or binimetinib), or ERK inhibitor (of note, regorafenib is not considered a BRAF inhibitor for the context of eligibility criteria)\n* Participants must not have had prior treatment with anti-EGFR therapies\n* Participants must not have had prior treatment with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CTLA-4 antibody, or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation or immune checkpoint pathways\n* Participants must not have a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (> 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of registration. Inhaled or topical steroids and adrenal replacement doses < 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease. Patients are permitted to use topical, ocular, intra-articular, intranasal, and inhalational corticosteroids (with minimal systemic absorption). Physiologic replacement doses of systemic corticosteroids are permitted, even if < 10 mg/day prednisone equivalents. A brief course of corticosteroids for prophylaxis (e.g., contrast dye allergy) or for treatment of non-autoimmune conditions (e.g., delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction caused by contact allergen) is permitted, as long as there has been a washout period for corticosteroids of >= 7 days prior to registration\n* Participants must not have received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to study registration. Seasonal flu and COVID vaccines that do not contain a live virus are permitted\n* Participants must not be receiving any other investigational agents\n* Participants must not have impaired gastrointestinal function or disease that may significantly alter the absorption of study drug (e.g., ulcerative diseases, uncontrolled vomiting, malabsorption syndrome, small bowel resection with decreased intestinal absorption)\n* Participants must not have a history of inflammatory bowel disease, (including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease), symptomatic autoimmune disease (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, systemic progressive sclerosis [scleroderma], systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune vasculitis [e.g., Wegener's Granulomatosis]); central nervous system (CNS) or motor neuropathy considered of autoimmune origin (e.g., Guillain-Barre Syndrome and myasthenia gravis, multiple sclerosis).\n\n  * Note: Participants with Graves' disease will be allowed\n* Participants must not have a history of pneumonitis that has required oral or intravenous (IV) steroids within the last 12 months\n* Participants must not have a history of a grade 3 or 4 allergic reaction attributed to humanized or human monoclonal antibody therapy\n* Participants must not have a history of a prior allogeneic tissue or solid organ transplant\n* Participants must not have a history of acute coronary syndromes (including myocardial infarction, unstable angina, coronary artery bypass grafting, coronary angioplasty, or stenting) within 6 months prior to study registration\n* Participants must not have uncontrolled blood pressure and hypertension within 28 days prior to registration.\n\n  * Uncontrolled blood pressure and hypertension is defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) > 170 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) > 100 mmHg within 28 days prior to registration. Participants are permitted to be receiving multiple anti-hypertensive medications (unless otherwise indicated in the study). All blood pressure measurements within the 28 days prior to registration must be SBP =< 170 and DBP =< 100. An exception can be made by a healthcare provider for a participant with a single blood pressure elevation who upon rechecking has a normal blood pressure\n* Participants must not have a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment (in the opinion of the treating physician) has the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen or requires concurrent therapy\n* Participants must not be pregnant or nursing. Individuals who are of reproductive potential must have agreed to use an effective contraceptive method with details provided as a part of the consent process. A person who has had menses at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months or who has semen likely to contain sperm is considered to be of \"reproductive potential.\" In addition to routine contraceptive methods, \"effective contraception\" also includes refraining from sexual activity that might result in pregnancy and surgery intended to prevent pregnancy (or with a side-effect of pregnancy prevention) including hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral tubal ligation/occlusion and vasectomy with testing showing no sperm in the semen\n* Participants must not be planning treatment with other systemic anti-cancer agents (e.g., chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy) or other treatments not part of protocol-specified anti-cancer therapy including concurrent investigational agents of any type",
