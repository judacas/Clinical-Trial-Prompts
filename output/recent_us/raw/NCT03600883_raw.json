Treatment with any live, live-attenuated or COVID-19 vaccine in the 28 days before the first dose of NG-641\n8. Treatment with any vaccine (including known non-adenoviral COVID-19 vaccines) in the 7 days before the first dose of NG-641\n9. History of prior Grade 3-4 acute kidney injury or other clinically significant renal impairment\n10. History of clinically significant interstitial lung disease or non-infectious pneumonitis\n11. Lymphangitic carcinomatosis\n12. Infectious or inflammatory bowel disease in the 3 months before the first dose of study treatment\n13. Any known CTCAE Grade ≥2 coagulation abnormality/coagulopathy\n14. Any clinically significant cardiovascular, peripheral vascular, cerebrovascular, or thromboembolic event in the 6 months before the first dose of study treatment\n15. Grade 3 or 4 gastrointestinal bleeding All toxicities attributed to prior anti-cancer therapy (including radiation therapy) other than alopecia must have resolved to Grade 1 or baseline before the first dose of study treatment\n16. Tumour location/extent considered by the Investigator to present a significant risk if tumour flare or necrosis were to occur\n17. Known retinopathy, including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, papilloedema, optic neuropathy and retinal artery or vein obstruction\n18. Active clinically severe depression\n19. Use of following prior therapies\n\n    * Enadenotucirev-based therapy, or a fibroblast activation protein (FAP) targeting agent anytime\n    * Anti-cancer monoclonal antibody (mAb), immune checkpoint inhibitor, immune stimulatory treatment or other biological therapy in the 28 days prior to the first dose of study treatment (PD-1 / PD-L1 therapy permitted without a 'washout' phase)\n    * Chemotherapy, targeted small molecule or other investigational drug in the 14 days or five half-lives (whichever is shorter) before the first dose of study treatment\n    * Major surgery in the 28 days before the first dose of study treatment or radiation therapy in the 14 days before the first dose of study treatment\n    * Bisphosphonate therapy or treatment with Receptor Activator of Nuclear factor Kappa-Β (RANK)-ligand inhibitors for metastatic bone disease is permitted\n20. All toxicities attributed to prior anti-cancer therapy (including radiation therapy) other than alopecia must have resolved to Grade 1 or baseline before the first dose of study treatment\n21. Known allergy/immune-related adverse reactions to NG-641 transgene or immune checkpoint inhibitor products or formulation; severe hypersensitivity to another monoclonal antibody\n22. Known hypersensitivity to both cidofovir and valacyclovir\n23. Other prior malignancy active within the previous 3 years (see protocol for exceptions)\n24. Symptomatic brain metastases or any leptomeningeal metastases that are symptomatic and/or requires treatment\n25. Any serious or uncontrolled medical disorder that, in the opinion of the Investigator or the Medical Monitor, may increase the risk associated with study participation or study treatment administration, impair the ability of the patient to receive protocol therapy or interfere with the interpretation of study results",
