No other systemic therapies for prostate cancer within 21 days prior to cycle 1 day 1 of study therapy or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter, prior to day 1 of study therapy.\n11. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 50% as determined by Multiple Gated acquisition (MUGA) scan or echocardiogram (ECHO) obtained during screening\n12.

Patients must agree to provide tumor tissue, either fresh or archival specimen of primary tumor and/or metastatic lesion, if available. Availability of tissue will not be required for enrollment.\n15. Subjects must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent prior to registration on study. Subjects should be willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study including undergoing treatment and scheduled visits and examinations at the institution.\n16. Only during phase 2, patients will be required to have mutations in DNA repair genes based on molecular tests performed on germline DNA, prostate cancer tissue or ctDNA. Qualifying mutations (i.e. deleterious/pathogenic alterations) in at least one of the following genes involved with homologous recombination repair will be required: BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, BARD1, BRIP1, CDK12, CHEK1, FANCL, FANCA, PALB2, PPP2R2A, RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D, and RAD54L.

During phase 2, patients must not have received previous treatment with a DNA-damaging cytotoxic chemotherapy (e.g. prior platinum-based chemotherapy and mitoxantrone are not permitted) or PARP inhibitor. Prior treatment with PARP inhibitor is allowed during phase I dose escalation.\n3. Untreated leptomeningeal or metastatic CNS disease; patients with treated disease may be eligible if clinically stable for 4 weeks after radiation or surgery including those with history of spinal cord compression that have received definitive treatment. If patients are receiving steroids as adjunct for treatment of leptomeningeal disease or metastatic CNS disease, dose should be stable for 4 weeks prior to day 1 of cycle 1.\n4. Clinically significant, uncontrolled heart disease and/or recent events including any of the following:\n\n   * History of acute coronary syndromes (including myocardial infarction, unstable angina, coronary artery bypass grafting, coronary angioplasty or stenting) or symptomatic pericarditis within 6 months prior to screening\n   * History of documented congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association functional classification III-IV)\n   * History of any cardiac arrhythmias, e.g., ventricular, supraventricular, nodal arrhythmias, or conduction abnormality within 12 months of screening. Patients with rate-controlled atrial fibrillation or flutter are permitted.\n   * QTcF > 470 msec on screening 12-lead ECG\n   * Documented cardiomyopathy\n5. Clinically significant uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure > 150 mmHg or diastolic pressure > 90 mmHg despite optimal medical management). For the purpose of this protocol definition of uncontrolled hypertension is based on persistent (≥72 hours) and symptomatic.\n6. Arterial or venous thrombotic or embolic events such as cerebrovascular accident (including transient ischemic attacks), deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism within 6 months before the start of study medication. However, patients with a venous thrombosis, including a pulmonary embolus, who have been on stable anticoagulation (more than 1 month without bleeding on a stable dose) is permitted.

History of uncontrolled human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection defined as CD4 < 200 cells/mm3 or detectable viral load is not allowed.\n10. Hepatitis B (HBV) or hepatitis C (HCV). All patients must be screened for HBV and HCV up to 28 days prior to study drug start using the routine hepatitis virus laboratorial panel. Patients positive for HBsAg or HBcAb will be eligible if they are negative for HBV-DNA. These patients should receive prophylactic antiviral therapy. Patients positive for anti-HCV antibody will be eligible if they are negative for HCV-RNA.\n11. Previous or concurrent history of malignancies within 5 years prior to study treatment except for curatively treated cervical carcinoma in situ, non-melanoma skin cancer, superficial bladder cancer (Ta [non-invasive tumor], Tis [carcinoma in situ] and T1 [tumor invades lamina propria]) or other T1 tumor that has been surgically removed with a low chance of recurrence in the next 3 years.\n12.

Patients with severe psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements in the judgment of study investigator\n16. Patient has a history of non-compliance to medical regimen or inability to grant consent\n17. Ongoing immunosuppressive therapy. Patients may be receiving up to 10mg/day of prednisone.\n18. Radiotherapy or immuno-/chemotherapy less than 2 weeks before start of treatment. A wash-out period of 2 months from radiopharmaceuticals such as radium-223 and 177Lu-PSMA among others will be required.\n19. Myeloid growth factors within 14 days prior to treatment.\n20. Blood or platelet transfusion less than 7 days before cycle 1 day 1.\n21. History of having received an allogeneic bone marrow or organ transplant.\n22. Major surgical procedure or significant traumatic injury (as judged by the investigator) within 28 days before start of treatment, or have not recovered from major side effects; open biopsy within 7 days before start of treatment.\n23. Anti-arrhythmic therapy for ventricular arrhythmias. Use of amiodarone and propafenone for atrial fibrillation rate control is allowed.\n24. Use of CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers. Copanlisib is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4. Therefore concomitant use of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, darunavir, indinavir, lopinavir, mifepristone, posaconazole, ombitasvir, idelalisib, cobicistat, atazanavir, ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir) and inducers (apalutamide, carbamazepine, enzalutamide, fosphenytoin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone, rifampin) is not allowed. Rucaparib is a moderate inhibitor of CYP1A2 and a weak inhibitor of CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 and no specific medications is contra-indicated but dose adjustment may be necessary of concurrent medication\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be MALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
