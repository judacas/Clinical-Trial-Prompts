    "exclusion_criteria": "Patients should not enter the study if any of the following exclusion criteria are fulfilled:\n\n* Participation in another clinical study with an investigational product during the last 4 weeks prior to randomization\n* Concurrent enrollment in another clinical study, unless it is an observational (non-interventional) clinical study or during the follow-up period of an interventional study\n* Prior systemic therapy for early-stage NSCLC that is under consideration for thisstudy.\n* Any unresolved toxicity NCI CTCAE Grade ≥2 from previous anticancer therapy with the exception of alopecia, vitiligo, clinically non-significant labs values (e.g., lymphopenia), and the laboratory values defined in the inclusion criteria\n\n  1. Patients with Grade ≥2 neuropathy will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis after consultation with the Study Physician.\n  2. Patients with irreversible toxicity not reasonably expected to be exacerbated by treatment with durvalumab may be included only after consultation with the Study Physician.\n* Any concurrent chemotherapy, IP, biologic, or hormonal therapy for cancer treatment.Concurrent use of hormonal therapy for non-cancer-related conditions (e.g., hormone replacement therapy) is acceptable.\n* Radiotherapy treatment to more than 30% of the bone marrow or with a wide field of radiation within 4 weeks of the first dose of study drug\n* Major surgical procedure (as defined by the Investigator) within 28 days prior to the first dose of IP.\n* History of allogenic organ transplantation.\n* Active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders (including inflammatory bowel disease [e.g., colitis or Crohn's disease], diverticulitis [with the exception of diverticulosis], systemic lupus erythematosus, Sarcoidosis syndrome, or Wegener syndrome [granulomatosis with polyangiitis, Graves' disease, rheumatoid arthritis, hypophysitis, uveitis, etc]).

Participants with a past or resolved HBV infection (defined as the presence of antiHBc and absence of HBsAg) are eligible. Participants positive for HCV antibody are eligible only if polymerase chain reaction is negative for HCV RNA\n* Known to have tested positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (positive HIV 1/2 antibodies) or active tuberculosis infection (clinical evaluation that may include clinical history, physical examination and radiographic findings, or tuberculosis testing in line with local practice).\n* Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 14 days before the first dose of durvalumab.

NOTE: Patients with endocrine AE of ≤Grade 2 are permitted to enroll if they are stably maintained on appropriate replacement therapy and are asymptomatic.\n  4. Required the use of additional immunosuppression other than corticosteroids for the management of an AE, experienced recurrence of an AE if re-challenged, and currently require maintenance doses of > 10 mg prednisone or equivalent per day.\n* Judgment by the investigator that the patient is unsuitable to participate in the study and the patient is unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions and requirements.\n* Known allergy or hypersensitivity to IP or any excipient.\n* Clinically significant active infection requiring systemic therapy",
