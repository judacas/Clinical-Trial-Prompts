    "inclusion_criteria": "Patients meeting all of the following criteria will be considered eligible for study entry:\n\n1. Disease progression following first-line systemic therapy with any fluoropyrimidine-based regimen for advanced disease (except FOLFOXIRI, see exclusion criteria).\n\n   • Patients may have received prior neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy which could have included irinotecan or oxaliplatin. If progression has occurred within 12 months from last dose of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment, this regimen will be considered as the one line of systemic therapy for advanced disease.\n   * If assigned to receive FOLFIRI, patient may have received no prior irinotecan as part of first-line systemic therapy.\n   * If assigned to receive FOLFOX, patient may have received no prior oxaliplatin as part of first line systemic therapy.\n   * Prior treatment with an anti-VEGF or anti-EGFR therapy is allowed as first-line and/or maintenance systemic therapy.\n2. Able to provide written informed consent for any study specific procedures.\n3. One or more tumors measurable on radiographic imaging as defined by RECIST 1.1\n4. Sufficient tumor tissue for mandatory pre-treatment evaluation (fresh biopsy [preferred], or archived tissue block specimen).\n5. ECOG performance status ≤1 within 7 days of first dose of study drug. Acceptable liver, renal, hematologic, and coagulation function\n6. Females of childbearing potential and male partners of female patients must agree to use adequate contraception during the study and for 6 months after their last dose of study drug\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "Patients meeting any of the following criteria are not eligible for study entry:\n\n1.

History of osteonecrosis of the hip or have evidence of structural bone abnormalities in the proximal femur on MRI scan that are symptomatic and clinically significant.\n14. Known osteoblastic bony metastasis.\n15. Major surgery 28 days prior to study entry.\n16. Prior radiation therapy within 14 days prior to study entry.\n17.
