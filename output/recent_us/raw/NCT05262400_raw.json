    "official_title": "Phase I Safety Assessment of Hypofractionated Postoperative Radiotherapy (H-PORT) for Intermediate-Risk Head and Neck Cancer",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Pathologically (histologically) proven diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma (including variants such as verrucous carcinoma, spindle cell carcinoma, carcinoma NOS, etc.) of the head/neck (oral cavity, oropharynx or larynx); Note: Hypopharynx primaries are excluded because these patients have both a poor prognosis and high likelihood of post- radiation complications.\n* Clinical stage I-IVA squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, oropharynx or larynx (AJCC 8th edition), including no distant metastases.\n\n  * General history and physical examination prior to registration;\n  * Chest X-ray (at a minimum) or chest CT scan (with or without contrast) or PET/CT of chest (with or without contrast) prior to registration.\n* Total resection of the patient's cancer (i.e. no residual disease after total resection of the patient's cancer).\n* One or more indications for postoperative radiotherapy, based upon pathologic findings:\n\n  * Perineural invasion;\n  * Lymphovascular invasion;\n  * Single lymph node ≥ 3 cm or ≥ 2 lymph nodes (no extracapsular Extension);\n  * Close margin(s) of resection (close margins defined as cancer extending to within 5 mm of a surgical margin);\n  * Pathologically confirmed T3 or T4a primary tumor;\n  * T2 oral cavity cancer with ≥ 5 mm depth of invasion.\n* Zubrod Performance Status 0-1.\n* Age 18-80.\n* Negative pregnancy test within 14 days prior to registration for participants who may become pregnant.\n* Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with the safety assessment of the investigational regimen are eligible for this trial.\n* The patient or a legally authorized representative must provide study-specific informed consent prior to study entry.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 80 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Recurrence of the study cancer.\n* History of systemic lupus erythematosus or systemic sclerosis (scleroderma).\n* Pregnancy and individuals unwilling to discontinue nursing.\n* Reliant on a feeding tube (gastric or jejuno) to maintain adequate nutrition at the time of registration\n* Anticipated need for high-dose systemic chemotherapy (e.g., high dose q3-week cisplatin), multiple systemic therapy agents or immunotherapy. Weekly single-agent systemic therapy with cisplatin, carboplatin, or cetuximab is allowable.\n* Prior radiotherapy to the region of the study cancer that would result in overlap of radiation therapy fields; prior chemotherapy for study cancer is not allowed.\n* Per the operative and/or pathology report, positive margin(s) [defined as tumor present at the cut or inked edge of the tumor], nodal extracapsular extension, and/or gross residual disease after surgery; Note: Patients whose tumors had focally positive margins in the main specimen but negative margins from re-excised samples in the region of the positive margin are eligible.",
