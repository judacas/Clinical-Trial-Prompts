Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.\n* Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and preferred contraception\n* Male subjects of reproductive potential (Section 5.11.2) must agree to use an adequate method of contraception as outlined in Section 5.11.2- Contraception, starting with the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy.\n* Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and preferred contraception for the subject.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Is currently participating and receiving study therapy or has participated in a study of an investigational agent and received study therapy or used an investigational device within 4 weeks of the first dose of treatment.\n* Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency including subjects infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).\n* Is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment.\n* Has a known history of active TB (Bacillus Tuberculosis).\n* Has had a prior anti-cancer monoclonal antibody (mAb) within 4 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.\n* Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy within 2 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to a previously administered agent.\n* Subjects with ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy are an exception to this criterion and may qualify for the study.\n* If subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting therapy.\n* Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment. -Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical cancer.\n* Lesions suspected to be at higher-risk for bleeding such as bowel involvement with tumor that invades into the bowel wall or involves the intraluminal component of bowel by imaging or direct visualization or central pulmonary lesions.\n* Ulcerated skin lesions\n* Poorly-controlled hypertension as defined BP > 150/100 mmHg, or SBP > 180 mmHg when DBP < 90 mmHg, on at least 2 repeated determinations on separate days within 3 months prior to study enrollment.\n* History within 6 months prior to treatment of myocardial infarction, severe/unstable angina pectoris, CABG, NYHA class III or IV CHF, stroke or TIA.\n* History within 3 months prior to treatment of Grade 3-4 GI bleeding/hemorrhage, treatment resistant peptic ulcer disease, erosive esophagitis or gastritis, infectious or inflammatory bowel disease, diverticulitis, pulmonary embolus, or other uncontrolled thromboembolic event.\n* Patients who are less than 4 weeks post-op after major surgery.\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to pembrolizumab and trebananib including history of allergic reactions to bacterially produced proteins.\n* Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis.
