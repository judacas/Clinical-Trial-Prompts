    "inclusion_criteria": "* First 3 subjects: male and female subjects age ≥ 18 years and < 27 years\n* Subsequent subjects: 12 months of age and <27 years of age at the time of study enrollment\n* Disease status (one of the following):\n\n  1. If post-allogeneic hematopoetic cell transplant (HCT): confirmed CD22+ leukemia recurrence, defined as ≥0.01% disease\n  2. If Relapse/Refractory status with no prior history of allogeneic HCT, one of:\n\n     * 2nd or grater marrow relapse, with or without extramedullary disease\n     * 1st marrow relapse at end of 1st month of re-induction with marrow having ≥0.01% blasts by morphology and/or MPF\n     * Primary Refractory, defined as >5% blasts by multi-parameter flow after ≥2 separate induction regimens\n     * Subject has indication for HCT but is ineligible, inclusive of persistent minimal residual disease\n  3. CD22+ Lymphoma refractory or relapsed with no known curative therapies available\n* Asymptomatic from CNS involvement, if present, and have a reasonable expectation that disease burden can be controlled in the interval between enrollment and T-cell infusion. Subjects with significant neurologic deterioration will not be eligible for T-cell infusion until stabilized.\n* Free from active GVHD and off immunosuppressive GVHD therapy for 4 weeks.\n* Lansky or Karnofsky performance score of ≥50\n* Life expectancy of >8 weeks\n* Recovered from acute toxic effects of all prior chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and radiotherapy\n* ≥7 days post last chemotherapy administration (excluding intrathecal or maintenance chemotherapy)\n* ≥7 days post last systemic corticosteroid administration\n* No prior virotherapy\n* Adequate organ function\n* Adequate laboratory values\n* Patients of childbearing/fathering potential must agree to use highly effective contraception\n* Signed a written consent\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 1 Year\nMust have maximum age of 26 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Presence of active clinically significant CNS dysfunction\n* Pregnant or breastfeeding\n* Unable to tolerate apheresis procedure, including placement of temporary apheresis line if required\n* Presence of active malignancy other than CD22+ leukemia or lymphoma\n* Presence of active severe infection\n* Presence of any concurrent medical condition that would prevent the patient from undergoing protocol-based therapy\n* Presence of primary immunodeficiency/bone marrow failure syndrome\n* Unwilling to participate in 15-year follow-up period that is required if CAR T cell therapy is administered",
