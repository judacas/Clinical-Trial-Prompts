    "inclusion_criteria": "* Documented informed consent of participant and/or legally authorized representative\n* Agreement to provide archival primary or metastatic tumor tissue if available\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) =< 2\n* Life expectancy > 12 months\n* Histologic diagnosis of prostate adenocarcinoma\n\n  * Pure small cell carcinoma will be excluded; however, component of neuroendocrine /small cell differentiation will be allowed provided that adenocarcinoma constitutes majority of the tissue specimen\n* Stage M1\n\n  * Metastatic disease can be documented by bone scan or computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or positron emission tomography (PET)/CT or the combination of these tests\n* Up to 4 metastatic lesions:\n\n  * Must have at least 1 bone lesion AND each non-visceral lesion should be less than 5 cm\n  * Visceral lesions will be limited to one lung lesion (< 2 cm) or one lymph node; no liver lesions allowed; lymph nodes allowed provided they are not in a field of prior radiation, and if amenable to SBRT (to be reviewed by principal investigator [PI])\n* Two lesions can be in close proximity (i.e. within 5 cm of each other) if they meet radiation SBRT normal tissue toxicity requirements\n* If have untreated primary prostate cancer: must undergo debulking prostatectomy\n* If had prior definitive radiation therapy to the prostate: no evidence of locally persistent or recurrent prostate cancer on digital rectal exam (DRE) and imaging studies (CT or MRI); retreatment to local residual-recurrent disease will result in potential eligibility to be reviewed by PI on a case-by-case basis\n* Does not have castration resistant disease\n\n  * Castration resistance defined as progression of disease despite serum testosterone level of < 50 ng/dL\n* PSA >= 0.2 prior to start of androgen deprivation treatment\n* Initiated 28 (+ 7) days of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) prior to day 1 of protocol therapy\n\n  * Only luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist/antagonist treatment is considered ADT, bicalutamide or other antiandrogens used alone do not count\n* May have received prior hormonal therapy in the context of definitive treatment of a primary tumor\n\n  * Patients may have had one prior systemic non-chemotherapeutic treatment (i.e. immunotherapy, receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, antiangiogenic agent, differentiating agent) for recurrent or metastatic disease\n* Must have refused standard of care chemotherapy for metastatic disease\n* Recovered from all acute side-effects (except alopecia) related to previous systemic therapy\n* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >= 1,500/mm^3 (to be performed within 14 days prior to day 1 of protocol therapy)\n\n  * NOTE: growth factor support is not permitted to normalize baseline ANC parameters, however subsequent growth factor administration is permitted as standard supportive care\n* Platelets >= 100,000/mm^3 (to be performed within 14 days prior to day 1 of protocol therapy)\n\n  * NOTE: transfusion of blood products are not allowed to normalize baseline blood parameters, however subsequent transfusions are allowed per standard supportive care guidelines\n* Hemoglobin (HgB) >= 9.0 g/dL (to be performed within 14 days prior to day 1 of protocol therapy)\n\n  * NOTE: transfusion of blood products are not allowed to normalize baseline blood parameters, however subsequent transfusions are allowed per standard supportive care guidelines\n* Total serum bilirubin =< 2 x upper limit of normal (ULN) (to be performed within 14 days prior to day 1 of protocol therapy)\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) =< 2.5 x ULN (to be performed within 14 days prior to day 1 of protocol therapy)\n* Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) =< 2.5 x ULN (to be performed within 14 days prior to day 1 of protocol therapy)\n* Creatinine =< 2.5 mg/dL (to be performed within 14 days prior to day 1 of protocol therapy)\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Prior radium Ra 223 dichloride\n* Prior or concomitant chemotherapy for metastatic or recurrent disease with the following exceptions:\n\n  * Prior chemotherapy for local primary disease is permitted\n  * Bisphosphonates or receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-Î’ (RANK) ligand inhibitors are allowed at doses and schedule consistent with the treatment or prevention of osteoporosis\n* Prior radiation treatment for metastatic disease\n* Concomitant radiation treatment to primary prostate site\n* Orchiectomy\n* Unstable medical comorbidities (i.e. uncontrolled cardiac comorbidities)\n* Metastases that in the judgment of investigator-radiologist are not amenable to SBRT\n* History of brain metastases or who currently have treated or untreated brain metastases\n* Uncontrolled human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection\n* Any other condition that would, in the investigator's judgement, contraindicate the patient's participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns with clinical study procedures\n* Prospective participants who, in the opinion of the investigator, may not be able to comply with all study procedures (including compliance issues related to feasibility/logistics)",
