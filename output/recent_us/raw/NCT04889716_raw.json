To be eligible for this trial, patients should be class II or better\n* Based on the mechanism of action, teclistamab may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Females of child-bearing potential (FCBP): should use effective contraception during treatment with teclistamab and for 5 months after the last dose. FCBP should not breast feed during treatment with teclistamab and for 5 months after the last dose. Should a FCBP become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. The effects of iberdomide on the developing human fetus are unknown. However, IMiDs are known to be teratogenic. FCBP must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL within 10-14 days prior to starting iberdomide, and again within 24 hours. FCBP must either commit to continued abstinence from heterosexual intercourse or begin two acceptable methods of birth control-one highly effective method and one additional effective method-at the same time, at least 28 days before starting iberdomide, while taking iberdomide, and for 28 days following discontinuation from the study. Examples of highly effective methods are intrauterine device, hormonal contraceptives, tubal ligation, or partner's vasectomy. Examples of barrier method are male condom, diaphragm, or cervical cap. FCBP must also agree to ongoing pregnancy testing. Men must practice complete abstinence or agree to use a condom during sexual contact with FCBP while participating in the study, during dose interruptions, and for at least 28 days following discontinuation from the study, even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy. All patients must be counseled at a minimum of every 28 days about pregnancy precautions and risk of fetal exposure\n* Men must agree to abstain from donating and semen or sperm while taking iberdomide, during dose interruptions, and for at least 28 days after the last dose of iberdomide.

Stable chronic liver disease (including Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones) or hepatobiliary involvement of malignancy is acceptable if participant otherwise meets entry criteria\n* Patients with known immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reaction or idiosyncratic reaction to drugs chemically related to teclistamab or iberdomide, or any of the components of the study treatment\n* Patients who are taking any anticancer therapy other than hormonal therapy (for prostrate or breast cancer) and palliative radiotherapy (defined as radiation to ≤ 3 sites of active multiple myeloma)\n* Patients who require immunosuppressive medications including, but not limited to, systemic corticosteroids at doses exceeding 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent. Use of immunosuppressive medications for the management of iberdomide-related adverse events (AEs) or in subjects with contrast allergies is acceptable. In addition, use of inhaled, topical, intranasal corticosteroids or local steroid injection (e.g., intra-articular injection) is permitted. Temporary use of corticosteroids for concurrent illnesses (e.g., food allergies, computed tomography [CT] scan contrast hypersensitivity, pneumonia, etc.) are acceptable\n* Patients who require medications that are strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4/5\n* Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents\n* Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness or any other significant condition(s) that would make participation in this protocol unreasonably hazardous\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because iberdomide is a thalidomide analog and thalidomide is a known human teratogen. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with iberdomide, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with iberdomide. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study\n* Patients who are unable or unwilling to undergo protocol required thromboembolism prophylaxis are excluded",
