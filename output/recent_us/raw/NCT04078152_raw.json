    "exclusion_criteria": "* Any serious medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric illness that would prevent the subject from signing the informed consent form\n* Any condition, including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which places the subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study or confounds the ability to interpret data from the study\n* Use of any other experimental drug or therapy within 28 days of baseline\n* Known hypersensitivity to lenalidomide, thalidomide, obinutuzumab, or mannitol\n* A history of erythema nodosum if characterized by a desquamating rash while taking thalidomide or similar drugs\n* Any prior use of obinutuzumab or CC-486\n* Concurrent use of other anti-cancer agents or treatments\n* Known active hepatitis B or C.

Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment.
