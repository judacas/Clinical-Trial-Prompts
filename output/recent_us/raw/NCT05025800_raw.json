Progression of prostate cancer either via PSA progression (two rising PSA levels measured >= 1 week apart, with second result >= 1 ng/mL) or radiographic progression with or without PSA progression\n5. Must have received at least one prior line of second-generation androgen receptor targeted therapy (e.g., abiraterone, enzalutamide, apalutamide)\n6. Patients with prostate cancer must have either measurable disease by RECIST v1.1 or bone lesions by bone scan, or both.\n\n   * Submission of a formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue block or a minimum of 12 freshly cut, unstained, serial tumor slides from the most recently collected tumor tissue for central molecular analysis (retrospective NGS testing for HR and PI3K-AKT pathway status and for other protocol-mandated secondary and exploratory assessments). Cytologic or fine needle aspirate samples are not acceptable. Tumor tissue from bone metastases is not acceptable.\n   * For men and women of child bearing potential: agreement to remain abstinent or use protocol defined contraceptive measures during the treatment period and for at least 28 days after the last dose of ipatasertib,or 6 months after the last dose of rucaparib, whichever occurs later\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Pregnant or breastfeeding, or intending to become pregnant during the study or within 28 days after the final dose of ipatasertib or 6 months after the final dose of rucaparib\n* Prior treatment with a PARP inhibitor, AKT inhibitor, or PI3K inhibitor\n* Treatment with investigational therapy within 14 days prior to initiation of study drug\n* Symptomatic and/or untreated CNS metastases\n* Uncontrolled tumor-related pain\n* Non-study-related minor surgical procedures <= 5 days or major (invasive) surgical procedure <=14 days prior to first dose of study treatment\n* Patients with active hepatitis C virus (HCV)\n* Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (chronic or acute), defined as having a positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) test or a positive quantitative HBV DNA test\n* Known HIV infection\n* Illicit drug or alcohol abuse within 12 months prior to screening, in the investigator's judgment\n* Malabsorption syndrome or other condition that would interfere with enteral absorption\n* Serious infection requiring antibiotics within 14 days of first dose of study treatment\n* Any serious medical condition or abnormality in clinical laboratory tests that, in the investigator's judgment, precludes the patient's safe participation in and completion of the study\n* Need for chronic corticosteroid therapy of >= 10 mg of prednisone per day or an equivalent dose of other anti-inflammatory corticosteroids or immunosuppressants for a chronic disease\n* History of another malignancy within 5 years prior to randomization, except for either adequately treated non-melanomatous carcinoma of the skin, adequately treated melanoma in situ, adequately treated non-muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (Tis, Ta, and low-grade T1 tumors), or other malignancies where the patient has undergone potentially curative therapy with no evidence of disease and are deemed by the treating physician to have a recurrence rate of < 5% at 5 years.\n* History of clinically significant cardiovascular dysfunction\n* Presence of any other condition that may have increased the risk associated with study participation or may have interfered with the interpretation of study results, and, in the opinion of the investigator, would have made the patient inappropriate for entry into the study\n\nIpatasertib-Specific Exclusion Criteria:\n\n* Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes mellitus requiring insulin at study entry\n* History of inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis), active bowel inflammation (e.g., diverticulitis)\n* Treatment with strong CYP3A inhibitors or strong CYP3A inducers within 4 weeks or five elimination half-live of the inhibitors, whichever is longer, prior to initiation of study drug",
