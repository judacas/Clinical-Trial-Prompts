    "exclusion_criteria": "* Received prior treatment for extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma\n* Medical illness unrelated to lymphoma, which, in the opinion of the treating physician and/or institutional principal investigator, makes participation in this study inappropriate.\n* Has received a live vaccine or live-attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug. Administration of killed vaccines is allowed.\n* Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or has required active treatment within the past 2 years.

Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment.\n* Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or has current pneumonitis.\n* Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.\n* Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).\n* Has active Hepatitis B (defined as HBV DNA is detected) or known active Hepatitis C virus (defined as HCV RNA is detected) infection.\n* Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the subject's participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.\n* Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial.\n* Is pregnant or breastfeeding or expecting to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the study, starting with the screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.\n* Has had an allogenic tissue/solid organ transplant.",
