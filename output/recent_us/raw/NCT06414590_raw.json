because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with atezolizumab, gemcitabine, and oxaliplatin, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with atezolizumab, gemcitabine, and oxaliplatin; these potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study",
