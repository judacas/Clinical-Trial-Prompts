No waiting is required following implantable port, enteral feeding tube and catheter placement\n* Has received any approved or investigational anti-neoplastic agent or immunotherapy other than PD-1 inhibitors (pembrolizumab or nivolumab) within 4 weeks prior to RiMO-301 injection\n* Patients with lesions which have significant blood vessel involvement (such as carotid artery encasement) or other major structures",
