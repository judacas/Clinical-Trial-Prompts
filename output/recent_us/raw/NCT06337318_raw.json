    "inclusion_criteria": "* RECRUITMENT CENTERS INCLUSION\n* A Recruitment Center is defined as an outpatient clinic, or group of clinics, belonging to the same National Cancer Institute Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) or minority/underserved (MU)-NCORP, who will be contributing physicians and patient participants to the study\n* Recruitment Centers must be part of an NCORP or MU-NCORP site with Cancer Care Delivery Research (CCDR) funding as this study is supported by CCDR funding. Each clinic included in the Recruitment Center must be associated with Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) site identification (ID).\n* Recruitment Centers must send large panel next generation sequencing genomic tests on at least 10 unique patients per month.\n* Recruitment Centers must have at least 4 practicing oncologists (including medical, gynecologic, or neuro-oncologists) at the site willing to participate in the study and register within three months of study activation.\n* Recruitment Centers must be willing to register a total of 66 patients (over 2 years) to the study.\n* Centers must be able to send at least one member of the study team to attend the Recruitment Center's cases presented to the S2108CD Genomic Tumor Board, should the Recruitment Center be randomized to the intervention arm.\n* Recruitment Centers must be willing and able to document the number of unique patients on which GTT is ordered at the Recruitment Center and submit this monthly to the S2108CD Study Team.\n* PHYSICIAN PARTICIPANT INCLUSION\n* Physician participant must be a registering investigator of the Recruitment Center that is participating in the study. If the physician is a registering investigator at more than one Recruitment Center, he/she must choose one Recruitment Center to identify with and enroll patients from.\n* Physician participants must be board-eligible or board-certified in Medical Oncology, Gynecologic Oncology, or Neurology with certification or eligible for certification in Neuro-oncology.\n* Physician participants must be willing to offer participation in the study to all eligible patients under their care for the duration of the study. A single physician may enroll multiple patients on the study.\n* Physician participants must be willing to complete all study questionnaires and, as part of the implementation objective, participate in interviews if invited.\n* Physician participants must complete all baseline questionnaires prior to registration.\n* Physician participants at a Recruitment Center randomized to the intervention arm must be willing to participate in the educationally enhanced GTB (EGTB).\n* PATIENT PARTICIPANT INCLUSION\n* Patient participants must have either recurrent, relapsed, refractory, metastatic, or newly diagnosed advanced stage III or stage IV solid tumor malignancy.\n* Patient participants must be under the care of a physician enrolled on the study.\n* Patient participants may have started anti-cancer treatment for the current diagnosis. The treating physician anticipates that the patient will start a new anti-cancer treatment (either first or subsequent lines) within 6 months after registration.\n* Patient participants are allowed to be co-enrolled on other clinical trials including non-treatment studies and studies that include investigational drugs. Patients may be enrolled on genome-informed therapeutic trials, such as LungMAP, MATCH, TAPUR, etc.\n* Patient participants' genomic tumor test must have been ordered within 7 days prior to registration with results pending. The genomic testing may be a commercially available panel (such as FoundationOne, Caris, Tempus, etc.) or a non-commercial tumor panel performed at an academic medical center.\n\n  * NOTE: Qualifying GTTs are defined as Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA)-certified next generation sequencing (NGS) tissue or liquid biopsy panels, including hotspot, whole gene, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) (including expression data) panels. Fluorescence-in-situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemistry test results assessing cancer-relevant proteins (e.g. Her2/neu, ALK, MET) and immune parameters (e.g. PD-L1 tests) are also permissible if performed in the context of a larger panel that includes NGS or expression profiling. These tests can come from any commercial or academic laboratory within the United States (US) and they should be ordered with the intent to influence genome-informed treatment decision. Oncotype DX and other panels used for making treatment decisions based on a prognostic read-out (e.g. liquid biopsy minimal residual disease [MRD]) are not permitted.\n* Patient participants must be at least 18 years of age.\n* Patient participants must have a Zubrod performance status of 0-2.\n* Participants (patients and physicians) must sign and give written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines. For patient participants with impaired decision-making capabilities, legally authorized representative may sign and give informed consent on behalf of study participants in accordance with applicable federal, local, and Central Institutional Review Board (CIRB) regulations. Documentation of informed consent via remote consent is permissible.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* RECRUITMENT CENTERS EXCLUSION\n* Recruitment Centers must not have or utilize an existing Genomic Tumor Board (GTB). For the purposes of this study, a Genomic Tumor Board is defined as an interdisciplinary team of clinicians and scientists that reviews genomic testing results and provides guidance on treatment options based primarily on genomic data to the treating physician. The existence of a general multidisciplinary tumor board that addresses all aspects of patient care and treatment is not considered an exclusion criterion. A general multidisciplinary tumor board is defined as an interdisciplinary team of clinicians that primarily discusses all aspects of cancer care, including diagnostic aspects (pathology and radiology), therapeutic options (surgical, radiation and medical) as well as palliative and psychosocial support options.\n* PATIENT PARTICIPANT EXCLUSION\n* Patient participants must not be going on hospice care at the time of registration.",
