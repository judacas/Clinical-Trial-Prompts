    "inclusion_criteria": "* Patient must be < 18 years of age at enrollment\n* Patient must have newly diagnosed intraocular (localized) retinoblastoma and meet one of the following criteria:\n\n  * Unilateral Group D retinoblastoma with vitreous seeding; OR\n  * Bilateral retinoblastoma with worst eye Group D, with vitreous seeding present and the contralateral eye is Group A-C; OR\n  * Bilateral Group D retinoblastoma with at least one eye with vitreous seeding; OR\n  * Bilateral retinoblastoma with one Group D eye with vitreous seeding and one Group E eye where the Group E eye has been enucleated prior to any therapy. Note exclusion for high-risk features\n  * Bilateral retinoblastoma with one Group D eye with vitreous seeding and one Group E eye where the Group E eye has not been enucleated prior to any therapy at the discretion of the treating physician. Note exclusion for patients with evidence of metastatic or extra orbital spread\n* Patients must have a performance status corresponding to Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scores of 0, 1 or 2. Use Karnofsky for patients > 16 years of age and Lansky for patients =<16 years of age\n* Peripheral absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >= 750/uL (must be performed within 7 days prior to enrollment unless otherwise indicated)\n* Platelet count >= 75,000/uL (transfusion independent) (must be performed within 7 days prior to enrollment)\n* A serum creatinine based on age/gender as follows (must be performed within 7 days prior to enrollment; must be repeated prior to the start of protocol therapy if > 7 days have elapsed from their most recent prior assessment):\n\n  * 1 month to < 6 months = 0.4 (male and female)\n  * 6 months to < 1 year = 0.5 (male and female)\n  * 1 to < 2 years = 0.6 (male and female)\n  * 2 to < 6 years = 0.8 (male and female)\n  * 6 to < 10 years = 1.0 (male and female)\n  * 10 to < 13 years = 1.2 (male and female)\n  * 13 to < 16 years = 1.5 (male) and 1.4 (female)\n  * >= 16 years = 1.7 (male) and 1.4 (female) OR - a 24-hour urine Creatinine clearance >= 70 mL/min/1.73 m^2 OR - a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) >= 70 mL/min/1.73 m^2. GFR must be performed using direct measurement with a nuclear blood sampling method OR direct small molecule clearance method (iothalamate or other molecule per institutional standard)\n  * Note: Estimated GFR (eGFR) from serum creatinine, cystatin C or other estimates are not acceptable for determining eligibility\n\n    * For patients < 1 month of age, serum creatinine levels must be < 1.5 x the treating institution's creatinine upper limit of normal (ULN) for patients < 1 month of age or the creatinine clearance or radioisotope GFR must be >= 70 mL/min/1.73 m^2\n* Total bilirubin =< 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) for age (must be performed within 7 days prior to enrollment; must be repeated prior to the start of protocol therapy if > 7 days have elapsed from their most recent prior assessment)\n* Serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) (alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) =< 135 U/L (must be performed within 7 days prior to enrollment; must be repeated prior to the start of protocol therapy if > 7 days have elapsed from their most recent prior assessment)\n\n  * Note: For the purpose of this study, the ULN for SGPT (ALT) has been set to the value of 45 U/L\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have maximum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Patients with evidence of metastatic or extra-orbital spread\n* Patients must not have an invasive infection at time of protocol entry\n* Patients must not have had any prior anti-cancer therapy other than cryotherapy and/or laser therapy (green or infrared) to the study eye(s) and non-study eye, including systemic chemotherapy, intra-arterial chemotherapy, radioactive plaque, brachytherapy, or radiation therapy.\n\n  * Note: A study eye is defined as being Group D with vitreous seeding. Patients may have had enucleation of one eye as long as the remaining eye is Group D with vitreous seeds\n* Patients with bilateral disease who undergo enucleation of a Group E eye prior to initiation of therapy and show evidence of high-risk histopathology features in the enucleated eye. High-risk histopathology includes choroid involvement >= 3 mm, post lamina optic nerve involvement, full thickness scleral invasion or optic nerve invasion to the cut end\n* Female patients who are pregnant since fetal toxicities and teratogenic effects have been noted for several of the study drugs. A pregnancy test is required for female patients of childbearing potential\n* Lactating females who plan to breastfeed their infants\n* Sexually active patients of reproductive potential who have not agreed to use an effective contraceptive method for the duration of their study participation\n* All patients and/or their parents or legal guardians must sign a written informed consent\n* All institutional, Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and National Cancer Institute (NCI) requirements for human studies must be met",
