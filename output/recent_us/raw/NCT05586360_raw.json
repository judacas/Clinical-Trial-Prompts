Kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty are not considered major surgery. If there is a question whether a procedure is considered a major surgery, the investigator must consult with the appropriate sponsor representative and resolve any issues before enrolling a participant in the study • Known chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) <50% of predicted normal of DLCO <50%).\n\nNote: FEV1 testing is required for participants suspected of having COPD and participants must be excluded if FEV1 <50% of predicted normal.\n\n• Known moderate of persistent asthma within the past 2 years or currently has uncontrolled asthma of any classification.\n\nNote: Participants who currently have controlled intermittent asthma or controlled mild persistent asthma are allowed in the study.\n\nNOTE: Investigators should ensure that all study inclusion/exclusion criteria have been met at screening and prior to the first dose of study drug. If a subject's clinical status changes (including any available laboratory results or receipt of additional medical records) after screening but before the first dose of study drug is given such that he or she no longer meets all eligibility criteria, supportive treatment may be administered according to local standards of care, if necessary, so that eligibility criteria may be met and laboratory test(s) may be repeated once, to determine if the subject qualifies for the study. If inclusion/exclusion criteria are not met after further evaluation, the subject should be excluded from participation in the study.",
