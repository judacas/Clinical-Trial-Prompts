The duration of this interval must be discussed with the study chair and the study-assigned research coordinator.\n  * Interleukins, Interferons and Cytokines (other than hematopoietic growth factors): >= 21 days after the completion of interleukins, interferon or cytokines (other than hematopoietic growth factors).\n  * Stem cell Infusions (with or without total body irradiation [TBI]):\n\n    * Allogeneic (non-autologous) bone marrow or stem cell transplant, or any stem cell infusion including DLI or boost infusion: >= 84 days after infusion and no evidence of graft versus host disease (GVHD).\n    * Autologous stem cell infusion including boost infusion: >= 42 days.\n  * Cellular Therapy: >= 42 days after the completion of any type of cellular therapy (e.g. modified T cells, natural killer [NK] cells, dendritic cells, etc.).\n  * Radiotherapy (XRT)/External Beam Irradiation including Protons: >= 14 days after local XRT; >= 150 days after TBI, craniospinal XRT or if radiation to >= 50% of the pelvis; >= 42 days if other substantial brain metastases (BM) radiation.\n\n    * Note: Radiation may not be delivered to \"measurable disease\" tumor site(s) being used to follow response to subprotocol treatment.\n  * Radiopharmaceutical therapy (e.g., radiolabeled antibody, 131I-MIBG): >= 42 days after systemically administered radiopharmaceutical therapy.\n  * Patients must not have received prior exposure to BVD-523FB (ulixertinib) or other ERK inhibitors.\n* For patients with solid tumors without known bone marrow involvement: Peripheral absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >= 1000/mm^3 (within 7 days prior to enrollment).\n* For patients with solid tumors without known bone marrow involvement: Platelet count >= 100,000/mm^3 (transfusion independent, defined as not receiving platelet transfusions for at least 7 days prior to enrollment).\n* Patients with known bone marrow metastatic disease will be eligible for study provided they meet the blood counts (may receive transfusions provided they are not known to be refractory to red cell or platelet transfusions). These patients will not be evaluable for hematologic toxicity.\n* Creatinine clearance or radioisotope glomerular filtration rate (GFR) >= 70 ml/min/1.73 m^2, or (within 7 days prior to enrollment).\n* A serum creatinine based on age/gender (within 7 days prior to enrollment).\n\n  * Age 1 to < 2 years, maximum serum creatinine (mg/dL) male 0.6, female 0.6\n  * Age 2 to < 6 years, maximum serum creatinine (mg/dL) male 0.8, female 0.8\n  * Age 6 to < 10 years, maximum serum creatinine (mg/dL) male 1, female 1\n  * Age 10 to < 13 years, maximum serum creatinine (mg/dL) male 1.2, female 1.2\n  * Age 13 to < 16 years, maximum serum creatinine (mg/dL) male 1.5, female 1.4\n  * Age >= 16 years, maximum serum creatinine (mg/dL) male 1.7, female 1.4\n* Bilirubin (sum of conjugated + unconjugated) =< 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) for age (within 7 days prior to enrollment).\n* Serum glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) (alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) =< 135 U/L.

Males or females of reproductive potential may not participate unless they have agreed to use an effective contraceptive method for the duration of study treatment and for 3 months after last dose of BVD-523FB (ulixertinib).\n* Patients receiving corticosteroids who have not been on a stable or decreasing dose of corticosteroid for at least 7 days prior to enrollment are not eligible.
