    "exclusion_criteria": "* History of any hypersensitivity or allergic reaction to any carbapenem\n* Fever suspected to be caused by a noninfectious cause (eg, fever related to drug or blood product administration)\n* Confirmed fungal infection (eg, Pneumocystis jirovecii etiology in patients with pneumonia) that justifies adding additional empiric antimicrobial therapy (eg, antifungals)\n* Confirmed viral infection that justifies adding additional empiric antiviral therapy (eg, ganciclovir, foscarnet)\n* Evidence of significant hepatic impairment (any of the following):\n\n  * Known acute viral hepatitis\n  * Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level > 5 times the upper limit of normal (x upper limit of normal [ULN]). Total bilirubin > 3 x ULN unless isolated hyperbilirubinemia is directly related to the acute infection or due to known Gilbert disease\n  * Manifestations of end-stage liver disease, such as ascites or hepatic encephalopathy\n* Known to be human immunodeficiency virus positive\n* Severely impaired renal function, defined as creatinine clearance (CrCl) =< 30 mL/min estimated by the Cockcroft-Gault formula\n* Expected requirement for hemodialysis while on study therapy\n* Received > 36 hours of IV antibacterial therapy (with study drugs) within 72 hours of the initiation of inpatient IV study drug for treatment of suspected infection. Antibiotic prophylaxis and oral antibiotics is allowed. Prophylactic use of antiviral or antifungal medication is permitted\n* Past or current history of epilepsy or seizure disorder; exception: well-documented febrile seizure of childhood\n* Evidence of immediately life-threatening disease, progressively fatal disease, or life expectancy of 3 months or less (eg, moribund or with shock unresponsive to fluid replacement)\n* Unable or unwilling to adhere to the study-specified procedures and restrictions\n* Any condition that would make the patient, in the opinion of the Investigator, unsuitable for the study (eg, would place a patient at risk or compromise the quality of the data\n* Participation in any other ongoing imipenem-relebactam trial",
