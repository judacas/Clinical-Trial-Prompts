Must have had 2-3 prior lines of therapy for CRC in the advanced or metastatic setting, including all of the following in the absence of contraindications: a) fluoropyrimidine, b) oxaliplatin, c) irinotecan, d) one or more biologics depending on the clinical scenario. Prior regorafenib and/or TAS-102 are allowed but not required. Note: a line of therapy is generally considered >2 weeks of exposure to the same regimen followed by radiographically documented progression. Agents that are mechanistically similar (e.g. 5-fluorouracil and capecitabine) and are used interchangeably due to tolerability but not progression may be considered as components of the same regimen upon discussion with the medical monitor.\n6. Willingness to undergo biopsy prior to study therapy and after approximately 6 weeks of study therapy. If biopsy on study is not feasible, then archival tissue must be available from within 90 days of signing consent.\n7. Willingness to undergo buccal swab prior to study therapy for the determination of HLA profile.\n8. Documented radiographic progression after the last regimen prior to entry on this study.\n9. Measurable disease, as defined by RECIST v1.1. Previously irradiated lesions can only be considered as measurable disease if disease progression has been unequivocally documented at that site since radiation.\n10.

Serum creatinine within normal limits or calculated creatinine clearance >60 mL/min/1.73 m2 using the Cockroft-Gault method (Appendix 2) for participants with serum creatinine levels above or below the institutional normal range;\n    7. Albumin ≥3.0 g/dL;\n    8. Acceptable coagulation parameters including international normalized ratio (INR) <1.5 and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) ≤ institutional ULN in the absence of anticoagulation (participant on anticoagulants must be discussed with the medical monitor).\n12. Has no major existing comorbidities or medical conditions that will preclude therapy in the view of the investigator.\n13. Resolution to Grade ≤1 by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 5.0 (NCI-CTCAE v 5.0) of all clinically significant toxic effects of prior therapies (with exception of peripheral neuropathy).\n14. Female participants are eligible to participate if at the time of screening are not pregnant, not breastfeeding, and at least one of the following conditions applies: (a) Not a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP); or (b) WOCBP who (i) agrees to use highly effective contraception starting with the screening visit through 90 days after the last dose of study treatment; and (ii) must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to receiving any dose of study medication. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required.\n\n    * Childbearing potential is defined by at least one of the following: (a) ≥50 years of age and has not had menses for greater than 1 year; (b) amenorrheic for ≥2 years without a hysterectomy and bilateral oophorectomy and a follicle-stimulating hormone value in the postmenopausal range upon pre-study (screening) evaluation; (c) has had hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or tubal ligation.\n    * Highly effective contraception is defined in Appendix 3 or per national or local guidelines.\n    * Abstinence is acceptable if this is the established and preferred method of contraception/lifestyle of the participant.\n15. Male participants with a female partner(s) of childbearing potential must agree to use highly effective contraception throughout the study starting with the screening visit through 90 days after the last dose of study treatment is received by the male participant. Male participants with pregnant partners must agree to use a condom; no additional method of contraception is required for the pregnant partner.\n\n    * Abstinence is acceptable if this is the established and preferred method of contraception of the participant.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
