Submission of BRCA testing results (germline and/or somatic) is required for all patients.\n* Platinum-sensitive disease defined as no clinical or radiographic evidence of disease recurrence for > 6 months (or 182 days) after last receipt of platinum-based therapy.

Thyroid replacement therapy is permitted to achieve a TSH within normal limits.\n* Patients must be able to swallow and retain oral medications and not have gastrointestinal illnesses that would preclude absorption of olaparib as judged by the treating physician.\n* Evidence of post-menopausal status or negative urinary or serum pregnancy test for pre-menopausal patients. Women will be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrheic for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. The following age-specific requirements apply:\n\n  * Women < 50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal treatments and if they have luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone levels in the post-menopausal range for the institution or underwent surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or hysterectomy).\n  * Women >= 50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments, had radiation-induced menopause with last menses > 1 year ago, had chemotherapy-induced menopause with last menses > 1 year ago, or underwent surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or hysterectomy).\n  * Administration of study drugs (olaparib, tremelimumab) may have an adverse effect on pregnancy and poses a risk to the human fetus, including embryo-lethality. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must agree to use two (2) highly effective forms of contraception from up to 14 days prior to enrollment (for oral contraceptives), during treatment, and for 6 months after the last dose of study medication.\n* Life expectancy >= 12 weeks.\n* Patients with brain metastases are eligible if follow-up brain imaging after central nervous system (CNS)-directed therapy shows no evidence of progression. Imaging studies must have been completed no later than 14 days prior to enrollment. In addition, patients must have been successfully weaned off steroid support. Patients should not have received steroids for the treatment of brain metastases within 14 days prior to enrollment.\n* Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients on effective anti-retroviral therapy with undetectable viral load within 6 months are eligible for this trial\n* The patient or a legally authorized representative must provide study-specific informed consent prior to study entry and, for patients treated in the United States (U.S.), authorization permitting release of personal health information.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be FEMALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Active infection requiring antibiotic therapy (except for uncomplicated urinary tract infections), including tuberculosis.\n* Known clinically significant liver disease, including active viral, alcoholic, or other hepatitis; and cirrhosis. For patients with evidence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, the HBV viral load must be undetectable on suppressive therapy, if indicated. Patients with a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection must have been treated and cured. For patients with HCV infection who are currently on treatment, they are eligible if they have an undetectable HCV viral load.\n* Hormonal therapy directed at treatment for the cancer must be discontinued at least 28 days prior to enrollment. Hormone replacement therapy for symptom management is permitted.\n* Any other therapy directed at treating the cancer including chemotherapy, biologic/targeted agents, and immunologic agents, unless discontinued at least 28 days prior to enrollment.\n* Any radiation therapy unless discontinued at least 28 days prior to enrollment.\n* Major surgical procedure within 28 days prior to enrollment.\n* Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 14 days before enrollment.

Additional workup to rule this out is not required.\n* Known potent CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers must be discontinued prior to starting treatment.\n* Symptoms associated with toxicities (> Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event [CTCAE version (v) 5.] grade 2) caused by prior cancer therapy, excluding alopecia, vitiligo, and the laboratory values defined in the inclusion criteria.\n\n  * Patients with grade >= 2 neuropathy will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis after consultation with the Study Chair.\n* Patients who are receiving any other investigational agent.\n* Resting electrocardiogram (ECG) with corrected QT interval (QTc) > 470 msec on two or more time points within a 24-hour period, or a family history of long QT syndrome.
