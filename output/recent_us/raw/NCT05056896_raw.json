    "official_title": "A Phase II Randomized Trial of RAdium-223 and SABR Versus SABR for oligomEtastatic Prostate caNcerS (RAVENS)",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Patient must have at least one and up to three asymptomatic metastatic tumor(s) of the bone or soft tissue (with at least one bone metastasis) develop within the past 6-months that are ≤ 5.0 cm or <250 cm3\n* Patient must have had their primary tumor treated with surgery and/or radiation.\n* Histologic confirmation of malignancy (primary or metastatic tumor).\n* PSADT <15 months. PSA doubling time (PSADT) will be calculated using as many PSA values that are available from time of relapse (PSA > 0.2). To calculate PSADT, the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center Prostate Cancer Prediction Tool will be used. It can be found at the following web site: https://www.mskcc.org/nomograms/prostate/psa-doubling-time.\n* Patient may have had prior systemic therapy and/or ADT associated with treatment of their primary prostate cancer. Patient may have had ADT associated with salvage radiation therapy (to the primary prostate cancer or pelvis is allowed).\n* PSA > 0.5 but <50.\n* Testosterone > 125 ng/dL.\n* Patient must be ≥ 18 years of age.\n* Patient must have a life expectancy ≥ 12 months.\n* Patient must have an ECOG performance status ≤ 2.\n* Patient must have normal organ and marrow function as defined as:\n\nBefore the first administration of Xofigo, the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) should be ≥ 1.5 x 109/L, the platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L and hemoglobin ≥ 10 g/dL.\n\n* Patient must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be MALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 100 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* No more than 3 years of ADT is allowed, with the most recent ADT treatment having occurred greater than 6 months prior to enrollment.\n* PSMA-PET/MRI or PSMA-PET/CT scan within the past 6 months with results that demonstrate more disease lesions than baseline CT/Bone Scan\n* Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).\n* Spinal cord compression or impending spinal cord compression.\n* Suspected pulmonary and/or liver metastases (greater >10 mm in largest axis).\n* Patient receiving any other investigational agents.\n* Patient receiving abiraterone and prednisone.\n* Patient is participating in a concurrent treatment protocol.\n* Serum creatinine > 3 times the upper limit of normal.\n* Total bilirubin > 3 times the upper limit of normal.\n* Liver Transaminases > 5-times the upper limit of normal.\n* Unable to lie flat during or tolerate PET/MRI, PET/CT or SBRT.\n* Prior salvage treatment to the primary prostate cancer or pelvis is allowed.\n* Refusal to sign informed consent.",
