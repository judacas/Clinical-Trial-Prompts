    "exclusion_criteria": "* Pathologic high-risk factors on diagnostic biopsy: high histologic grade (poorly differentiated), mucinous or signet ring histology, lymphatic/vascular or perineural invasion.\n* Patients with visible pelvic sidewall nodes on MRI.\n* Patients with unequivocal determination of nodal disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, would prohibit protocol therapy administration.\n* Previous pelvic radiation for any reason, including brachytherapy alone.\n* Patients who have had primary lesion excised prior to enrollment.\n* Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen are eligible for this trial.\n* Prior treatment for rectal cancer.\n* Patients with known dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency (DYPD).\n* Potential trial participants should have recovered from clinically significant adverse events of their most recent therapy/intervention prior to enrollment.\n* Patients with known history or current symptoms of cardiac disease, or history of treatment with cardiotoxic agents, should have a clinical risk assessment of cardiac function using the New York Heart Association Functional Classification. To be eligible for this trial, patients should be class 2B or better.\n* Any contra-indications to undergo MRI imaging.\n* Presence of anterior lesions above or near peritoneal reflection rendering the patient ineligible for a transanal tumour excision.",
