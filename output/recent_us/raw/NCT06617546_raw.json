    "inclusion_criteria": "* Age ≥18 years\n* Pathologically confirmed cutaneous T-cell lymphoma consistent with mycosis fungoides (MF) based on biopsy done or reviewed at MSKCC\n* Stage IB or higher MF per ISCL/EORTC criteria; concurrent diagnosis of Sézary syndrome permissible. Patients who have not had prior systemic therapies and refractory/relapsed patients are eligible.\n* Baseline mSWAT score of at least 10\n* Stable topical steroids or systemic antipruritic agent (e.g. antihistamines, doxepin, GABA analogs) preceding study entry is permissible, but no new prescribed or over the counter topical or systemic anti-pruritics started post-enrollment\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2\n* Ability to provide informed consent\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Any oral retinoid therapy for any indication within 3 weeks of the first dose of study drug\n* Prior TSEB (prior focal skin-directed RT acceptable)\n* Concurrent diagnosis of systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) or another non-Hodgkin lymphoma\n* Concurrent diagnosis of additional non-skin malignancy\n* Pregnancy\n* Patients unwilling to use two forms of barrier contraception while taking study medication\n* Receipt of treatment with another investigational device or drug (at present or within 2 weeks of enrollment)\n* Familial hypertriglyceridemia or other medical conditions in which use of bexarotene would be contraindicated\n* High likelihood of protocol non-compliance (in opinion of investigator)\n* Systemic steroids within two weeks of first dose of study drug (patients on systemic steroids for non-disease related conditions will be permitted per investigator discretion)\n\nProhibited concurrent medications\n\n* Gemfibrozil is contraindicated as may increase bexarotene concentrations\n* Bexarotene is a minor CYP3A4 substrate: avoid strong/moderate CYP3A4 inducers and inhibitors, if possible, but concomitant use is not a contraindication Bexarotene is a moderate CYP3A4 inducer: avoid concurrent administration with CYP3A4 sensitive substrates, for which minimal concentration changes may lead to therapeutic failures of the substrate (e.g. cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus, quinidine, fentanyl), if possible",
