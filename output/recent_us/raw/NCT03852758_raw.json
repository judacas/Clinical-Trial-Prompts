    "official_title": "A Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Phase III Study to Evaluate the Efficacy, Safety, and Tolerability of Iptacopan in Patients With Generalized Myasthenia Gravis (gMG), Followed by an Open Label Extension Phase",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Adult patients with generalized Myasthenia Gravis (age 18-75 years)\n* Positive serology testing for AChR+ antibody at screening\n* Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA) Class II-IV gMG and likely not in need v of a respirator for the duration of the study, as judged by the Investigator.\n* The confirmation of the diagnosis of gMG should be documented and supported by ≥1 of the following 3 tests:\n* History of abnormal neuromuscular transmission demonstrated by single-fiber electromyography or repetitive nerve stimulation.\n* History of positive edrophonium chloride test\n* Patient has demonstrated improvement in MG signs on oral acetylcholinesterase inhibitors as assessed by the treating physician.\n* Baseline MG-ADL score ≥6, with ≥50% of the total score due to non-ocular symptoms\n* Participants not optimally controlled for ≥ 6 months on\n* just one NSIST; or\n* two or more NSISTs; or\n* on frequent (at least quarterly) plasmapheresis, plasma exchange, or intravenous immunoglobulin to control symptoms despite treatment with steroids and NSISTs; or\n* one of the following gMG treatments:\n* a FcRN antagonist approved for gMG\n* rituximab\n* other approved gMG therapies excluding complement inhibitors.\n* Consistent with all other iptacopan trials, participants will have to be vaccinated against Neisseria meningitidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae. In addition, participants will be vaccinated against Haemophilus influenzae, depending on the local regulations and on the availability of this vaccine in the countries of study conduct. The vaccination will be performed at least 2 weeks prior to first dosing with iptacopan, covering as many serotypes as possible. If iptacopan treatment will start earlier than 2 weeks post vaccination, prophylactic antibiotic treatment must be initiated and administered until 2 weeks post vaccination.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 75 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Have been treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)/plasma exchange (PLEX) in the past month, with rituximab in the past 6 months, eculizumab in the past 2 months, ravulizumab or other complement inhibitors in the past 3 months, efgartigimod or other anti- FcRn therapies in the past 3 months, or had a thymectomy in the past 6 months or a planned thymectomy during the trial period.\n* Participants with clinically significant active or chronic uncontrolled bacterial, viral, or fungal infection at screening, including patients who test positive for an active viral infection at screening with: Active Hepatitis B Virus (HBV): serologic panel test results indicative of an active (acute or chronic) infection; Active Hepatitis C Virus (HCV): serology positive for HCV-Ab; Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) positive serology associated with an Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS)-defining condition or with a cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) count\n\n  * 200 cells/mm3\n* Female participants who are pregnant or lactating, or are intending to become pregnant.\n* Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, unless they are using effective methods of contraception during dosing of study treatment.\n* Active systemic bacterial, viral (including COVID-19) or fungal infection or any major episode of infection that required hospitalization or injectable antimicrobial therapy within 14 days prior to study drug administration.\n* History of recurrent invasive infections caused by encapsulated organisms, e.g., N. meningitidis and S. pneumoniae.\n* Presence of fever ≥ 38 °C (100.4 °F) within 7 days prior to study drug administration",
