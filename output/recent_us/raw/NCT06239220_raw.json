    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Pediatric, adolescent, or young adult patients who have relapse or refractory T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) or T-Cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LLy) according to 2017 WHO classification and NCCN v1 2021.\n2. Patients have adequate performance status (ECOG ≤2) for patients≥16 years old, Lansky score >50 for patients<16 years old.\n3. Patients must be 1mo to 21 years of age at time of signing/or having proxy sign the informed consent.\n4. Patients with asymptomatic CNS disease are eligible (see also Exclusion Criterion #2 in section 4.2.)\n5. The following conditions are allowed on study: conditions requiring systemic glucocorticoid use, such as autoimmune disease, acute or chronic controlled graft versus host disease (GVHD) or severe asthma. Patients are also allowed up to 5 days of glucocorticoids as cytoreduction in combination with up to 3 doses of cyclophosphamide (200 mg/m2/day) are allowed as standard pre-phase treatment up to 1 day before start of study treatment or cytarabine up to 2gm/m2. This can also be discussed with PI.\n6. Patients must have adequate organ function and laboratory results (obtained within 14 days of enrolment:\n\n   1. Total serum bilirubin ≤1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN). Patients with known Gilbert's syndrome may have a total bilirubin up to ≤3 x ULN.\n   2. Adequate renal function (creatinine clearance ≥ 30 mL/min) unless related to disease.\n   3. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and/or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤3 x ULN; ≤5 x ULN unless in case of suspected leukemic liver involvement\n   4. Amylase, Lipase and Triglycerides must be WNL prior to administration of calaspargase pegol-mknl. If the lab values are outside the normal range, the treating physicians can discuss dosing/enrolling per PI discretion.\n7.

Presence of clinically significant uncontrolled CNS pathology such as epilepsy, paresis, aphasia, stroke, severe brain injuries, organic brain syndrome, or psychosis.\n\n   Presence of the following are allowed: headaches, vomiting, nerve palsy\n3. Significant traumatic injury or major surgery (major surgery means opening of a body cavity, e.g., thoracotomy, laparotomy, laparoscopic organ resection, and major orthopedic procedures, e.g. joint replacement, open reduction, and internal fixation) within 14 days of scheduled dosing day 1.\n4. Male or female subjects of childbearing potential, unwilling to use an approved, effective means of contraception in accordance with institution's standards.\n5. Patients with uncontrolled infections (viral, bacterial, or fungal) per PI's discretion. Infections controlled on concurrent anti-microbial agents are acceptable, and anti-microbial prophylaxis per institutional guidelines are acceptable.\n6.

Female patient who is pregnant or breastfeeding. Female patient who is considering becoming pregnant during the study; or within approximately 30 days after the last dose of venetoclax, 3 months after the last dose of calaspargase or 6 months after the last dose of decitabine. For decitabine and calaspargase, also see the study drugs product label for pregnancy precautions. Male patient who is considering fathering a child within approximately 30 days or donating sperm during the study, within approximately 90 days after the last dose to venetoclax, calaspargase and decitabine.
