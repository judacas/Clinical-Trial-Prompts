    "inclusion_criteria": "* Subjects must have biopsy-confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate\n* Subjects must discontinue any prior systemic therapies (excluding GnRH agonist/antagonists) without PSA withdrawal effects if using first generation anti-androgens. Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analogues must be continued if they have not undergone orchiectomy. (Subjects who recently started systemic therapy for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) are eligible to enroll if new therapy was started ≤ 14 days to consent date.)\n* Subjects must have progressive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer based on at least one of the following criteria while having castrate levels (<50 ng/dL) of testosterone:\n* A) PSA progression defined as a 25% increase over baseline value with an increase in the absolute value of at least 2.0 ng/mL that is confirmed by another PSA level with a minimum of a 1-week interval.\n* B) Progression of bidimensionally measurable soft tissue or nodal metastasis by CT scan or MRI based on RECIST criteria\n* C) Progression of bone disease on bone scan as defined by two new lesions arising\n* Subjects must have oligometastatic prostate cancer, defined as between 1 and ≤5 treatment sites that can be treated within a radiotherapy treatment field.\n* Subjects must be medically fit to undergo radiotherapy and systemic therapy as determined by the treating physician.\n* Age ≥ 18\n* ECOG ≤ 2 (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group scoring system used to quantify general well-being and activities of daily life; scores range from 0 to 5 where 0 represents perfect health and 5 represents death)\n* No prior invasive malignancy in the past 3-years. Exceptions include non-melanomatous skin cancer and in situ cancers of the bladder or head and neck are permissible.\n* Subjects must freely sign informed consent to enroll in the study.\n* Subjects must use contraception up to 90 days after last drug dose.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be MALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Planned systemic therapy with Radium-223 dichloride or sipuleucel-T\n* Tumor requiring emergent radiation in view of provider\n* Life expectancy estimate of <3 months\n* Presence of known parenchymal brain metastasis\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness\n* Inability to undergo radiotherapy, systemic treatment, CTs or bone scans\n* Biopsy proven pure small cell or neuroendocrine prostate cancer",
