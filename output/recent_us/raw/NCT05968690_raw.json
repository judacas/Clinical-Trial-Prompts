symptomatic lesions (e.g., bone metastases or metastases causing nerve impingement) amenable to palliative radiotherapy should be treated prior to randomization; patients should be recovered from the effects of radiation; there is no required minimum recovery period; asymptomatic metastatic lesions whose further growth would likely cause functional deficits or intractable pain (e.g., epidural metastasis that is not presently associated with spinal cord compression) should be considered for loco-regional therapy if appropriate prior to randomization\n* Uncontrolled hypercalcemia (> 1.5 mmol/L ionized calcium or calcium > 12 mg/dL or corrected serum calcium > upper limit of normal [ULN]) or symptomatic hypercalcemia requiring continued use of bisphosphonate therapy; patients who are receiving denosumab must discontinue denosumab use and replace it with a bisphosphonate instead while on study; patients receiving a bisphosphonate for skeletal metastases are not excluded and can continue treatment\n* Malignancies other than triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) within 5 years prior to randomization, with the exception of those with a negligible risk of metastasis or death and treated with expected curative outcome (such as adequately treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix or basal or squamous cell skin cancer)\n* Concurrent anti-cancer therapy (chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery, immunotherapy, hormonal therapy, biological therapy) other than the ones specified in the protocol; any other investigational drugs should be discontinued 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study medication\n* GENERAL MEDICAL EXCLUSION CRITERIA\n* Women only: pregnancy or lactation\n* Evidence of significant uncontrolled concomitant disease that in the opinion of the investigator could affect compliance with the protocol or interpretation of results, including significant liver disease (such as cirrhosis, uncontrolled major seizure disorder, or superior vena cava syndrome)\n* Significant cardiovascular disease, such as New York Heart Association (NYHA) cardiac disease (class II or greater), myocardial infarction within 3 months prior to randomization, unstable arrhythmias, or unstable angina;
