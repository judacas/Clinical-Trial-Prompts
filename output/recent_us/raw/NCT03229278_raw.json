    "inclusion_criteria": "* Histologically confirmed (from prior treatment) non-resectable ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer.\n* High-grade serous [including malignant mixed Mullerian tumor (MMMT) with metastasis that contains high-grade epithelial carcinoma, FIGO grades 2 & 3 allowed], endometrioid, or clear-cell ovarian cancer.\n* Performance status ECOG of 0 or 1.\n* Life expectancy of at least 6 months.\n* Received a minimum of 3 prior lines (including the 1st line) of systemic therapy with no maximal limit.\n* Platinum-resistant or -refractory disease based on platinum-free interval (PFI) from the last dose of the most recent. platinum-based line of therapy (must have received a minimum of 2 doses of platinum in that line) to subsequent disease progression based on radiological assessment. Platinum-refractory: PFI of < 1 month (including disease progression while on platinum-based therapy). Platinum-resistant: PFI of 1-6 months.\n* Received prior bevacizumab (or biosimilar) treatment.\n* No contraindication to receive carboplatin, cisplatin or bevacizumab (or biosimilar).\n* Have disease progression after last prior line of therapy based on radiological assessment prior to randomization.\n* At least 1 measurable target lesion per RECIST 1.1 based on abdominal/pelvis imaging scan at screening.\n* Evidence by CT and/or PET scans or physical exam of abdominal/pelvis region likely having disease in the peritoneal cavity (i.e., peritoneal carcinomatosis).\n* Adequate renal, hepatic, bone marrow function, adequate coagulation tests, adequate immune function by lymphocyte count.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be FEMALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Tumors of mucinous, low-grade serous, squamous cell, small cell neuroendocrine subtypes, MMMT tumors absent an epithelial component on recent biopsy, or non-epithelial ovarian cancers (e.g., germ cell tumors, Sex-cord tumors).\n* Bowel obstruction within last 3 months prior to screening.\n* Active urinary tract infection, pneumonia, other systemic infections.\n* Active gastrointestinal bleeding.\n* Known current central nervous system (CNS) metastasis.\n* Inflammatory diseases of the bowel.\n* History of HIV infection.\n* Active hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus within 4 weeks prior to study.\n* History of thromboembolic event within the prior 3 months.\n* Contraindications for intraperitoneal (IP) catheter placement: Bowel obstruction with distended abdomen, rigid abdomen with bulky anterior wall carcinomatosis, abdominal wall hernia mesh that precludes laparoscopic entry to abdomen.\n* Clinically significant cardiac disease at screening (New York Heart Association Class III/IV).\n* Acute cerebrovascular event(s) such as cerebrovascular accident (CVA) or transient ischemic attack (TIA) in previous 6 months.\n* Oxygen saturation <90%.\n* Received prior virus-based gene therapy or therapy with cytolytic virus of any type.\n* Receiving concurrent antiviral agent.\n* Prior malignancy of other histology active within previous 3 years except for locally curable cancers apparently cured such as basal/squamous cell skin cancer, superficial bladder cancer, carcinoma in situ of cervix or breast, any other stage I/II local malignancies.\n* Received chemotherapy, radiotherapy, other anti-cancer biologic therapies within 4 weeks prior to planned treatment.\n* Underwent surgery within 4 weeks, or have insufficient recovery from surgical-related trauma or wound healing, prior to first study treatment in either Arm.\n* Receiving immunosuppressive therapy or steroids (except acute concurrent corticosteroid of no more than 20 mg per day for medical management with prednisolone equivalent.\n* Symptomatic malignant ascites or pleural effusions defined as rapidly progressive ascites with abdominal distension and gastrointestinal dysfunction, pleural effusions with respiratory difficulties requiring frequent paracentesis > once every 14 days.\n* Known hypersensitivity to gentamicin.",
