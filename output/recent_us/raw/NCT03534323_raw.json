    "official_title": "A Phase I Study of HCW9218, a Bifunctional TGF-B; Antagonist/IL-15 Protein Complex, in Select Advanced Solid Tumors After Failing at Least Two Prior Therapies",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced/metastatic solid tumor cancer (except pancreatic and primary brain cancers), has failed at least 2 prior lines of therapy given either in the recurrent or metastatic setting and must be refractory to or intolerant of existing therapy(ies) known to provide clinical benefit for their condition.\n* Measurable disease per RECIST v 1.1.\n* Acute effects of any prior therapy must have resolved to baseline or Grade ≤1 NCI CTCAE v5 except for AEs not constituting a safety risk by enrolling Investigator judgment.\n* Age 18 years or older at the time of consent.\n* ECOG Performance Status 0 or 1.\n* Evidence of adequate organ function within 14 days prior to enrollment as defined in Section 4.1.6.\n* Adequate pulmonary function with PFTs >50% FEV1 if symptomatic or known impairment.\n* Sexually active persons of child-bearing potential or with partners of childbearing potential must agree to use a highly effective form of contraception (refer to Section 4.1.10 for acceptable methods) for at least 28 days after the last dose of HCW9218.\n* Provides voluntary written consent prior to the performance of any research related activity.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Pregnant or breastfeeding.\n* History of clinically significant vascular disease, including any of the following within 6 months prior to start of study treatment: MI or unstable angina, percutaneous coronary intervention, bypass grafting, ventricular arrhythmia requiring medication, stroke or transient ischemic attack, symptomatic peripheral arterial disease.\n* Marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval (e.g., demonstration of a QTc interval greater or equal to 470 milliseconds by Fridericia's correction).\n* Known or suspected untreated CNS metastases.\n* Anti-cancer treatment including surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, other immunotherapy, or investigational therapy within 14 days before treatment start.\n* Other prior malignancy except for the following: adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, adequately treated Stage I or II cancer from which the subject is currently in complete remission, or any other cancer from which the subject has been disease-free for 3 years after surgical treatment.\n* Known hypersensitivity or history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to the agents used in the study.\n* Prior therapy with TGF-β antagonist, IL-15 or analogs.\n* Concurrent use of St. John's wort and and/or other herbal CYP modulators within 7 days of Day 1. Must agree to not use during study treatment through the end of treatment visit to be eligible.\n* Known autoimmune disease requiring active treatment. Persons with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (> 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of enrollment. Inhaled or topical steroids, and adrenal replacement steroid doses ≤ 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent, are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease.\n* Active systemic infection requiring parenteral antibiotic therapy. All prior infections must have resolved following optimal therapy.\n* Prior organ allograft or allogeneic transplantation.\n* Known HIV-positive or AIDS.\n* Psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* Other illness or a medical issue that in the opinion of the Investigator would exclude the subject from participating in this study",
