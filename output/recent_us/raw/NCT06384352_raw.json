    "exclusion_criteria": "* Prior or ongoing hormonal treatment for prostate cancer including, but not limited to orchiectomy, antiandrogens, abiraterone, ketoconazole, or estrogens, or luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists/antagonists. Men on stable doses of 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (e.g., finasteride, dutasteride) are eligible as long as there is no planned dose change while on study\n* Patients who have prostate cancer with distant metastases\n* Presence of neuroendocrine differentiation in the prostate biopsies\n* Serum testosterone (blood collected between 7-10 AM for men < 45 years of age and prior to 2 PM for men >= 45 years of age) < 200 ng/dL\n* Have a history of prior malignancies other than prostate cancer within the past 2 years, excluding non-melanoma skin cancer\n* Severe or unstable angina, myocardial infarction, symptomatic congestive heart failure, arterial or venous thromboembolic events (e.g., pulmonary embolism, cerebrovascular accident including transient ischemic attacks), or clinically significant ventricular arrhythmias within 6 months prior to registration\n* History of seizure or known condition that may pre-dispose to seizure (including but not limited to prior stroke, transient ischemic attack, loss of consciousness within 1 year prior to registration, brain arteriovenous malformation; or intracranial masses such as schwannomas and meningiomas that are causing edema or mass effect)\n* Use of drugs known to lower the seizure threshold, including: atypical antipsychotics (e.g. clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, ziprasidone), bupropion, lithium, meperidine, pethidine, phenothiazine antipsychotics (e.g. chlorpromazine, mesoridazine, thioridazine), and tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline, desipramine, doxepin, imipramine, maprotiline, mirtazapine)\n* Concurrent use of drugs in category X drug interactions with apalutamide\n* Participants may not be receiving any other investigational agents\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical composition of apalutamide\n* Uncontrolled intermittent illnesses or medical conditions which, in the opinion of the treating physician, would make this protocol unreasonably hazardous for the patient. Such illnesses/conditions may include, but are not limited to, hypertension, ongoing or active infection, or psychiatric illness/social situations",
