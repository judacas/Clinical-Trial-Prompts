For patients whose cumulative dose is between 350-450 mg/m2, Zinecard is strongly recommended.\n5. At least 3 months since the last treatment with a \"VXLD\" induction/re-induction type regimen (i.e., anthracycline, steroid, asparaginase and vincristine).\n6.

Clinical laboratory values within the following parameters (repeat if more than 3 days before the first dose):\n\n   1. Albumin > 2.7 g/dL\n   2. Total bilirubin ≤ 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN).\n   3. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 2.5 × ULN,\n   4. Creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min;\n   5. White blood cell (WBC) count < 50,000/µL before administration of pevonedistat on Cycle 1 Day 1. Note: Hydroxyurea or leukapheresis may be used to control the level of circulating leukemic blast cell counts. (if applicable)\n8. Female patients who:\n\n   * Are postmenopausal (see Appendix for definition) for at least 1 year before the screening visit, OR\n   * Are surgically sterile, OR\n   * If they are of childbearing potential:\n\n     * Agree to practice 1 highly effective method and 1 additional effective (barrier) method of contraception (see Appendix), at the same time, from the time of signing the informed consent through 4 months after the last dose of study drug (female and male condoms should not be used together), or\n     * Agree to practice true abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. (Periodic abstinence [eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods] withdrawal, spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea are not acceptable methods of contraception.)\n9. Male patients, even if surgically sterilized (ie, status postvasectomy), who:\n\n   * Agree to practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study treatment period and through 4 months after the last dose of study drug (female and male condoms should not be used together), or\n   * Agree to practice true abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. (Periodic abstinence [eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods for the female partner] withdrawal, spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea are not acceptable methods of contraception.)\n10. Voluntary written consent must be given before performance of any study related procedure not part of standard medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn by the patient at any time without prejudice to future medical care.\n11. Patients must have recovered from the acute side effects of all prior anticancer therapy:\n\n    * At least 1 week from prior cytotoxic chemotherapy.\n    * At least 4 weeks from craniospinal irradiation\n    * At least 4 months since hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) with no evidence of acute graft vs host disease (GVHD).\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 16 Years\nMust have maximum age of 39 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Treatment with any investigational products within 2 weeks before the first dose of any study drug.\n2.

Active uncontrolled infection or severe infectious disease, defined as positive blood culture within 48 hours of study registration, need for supplemental oxygen or vasopressors within 48 hours of study entry.\n4.

Patients with uncontrolled coagulopathy or bleeding disorder, deemed not to be related to underlying disease.\n9. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositive.\n10. Known hepatitis B surface antigen seropositive or known or suspected active hepatitis C infection Note: Patients who have isolated positive hepatitis B core antibody (ie, in the setting of negative hepatitis B surface antigen and negative hepatitis B surface antibody) must have an undetectable hepatitis B viral load. Patients who have positive hepatitis C antibody may be included if they have an undetectable hepatitis C viral load.\n11. Known hepatic cirrhosis or severe pre-existing hepatic impairment\n12. Known cardiopulmonary disease defined as:\n\n    * Unstable angina;\n    * Congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV; see appendix);\n    * Myocardial infarction (MI) within 6 months prior to first dose (patients who had ischemic heart disease such as a (ACS), MI, and/or revascularization greater than 6 months before screening and who are without cardiac symptoms may enroll);\n    * Cardiomyopathy;\n    * Clinically significant arrhythmia:\n\n      1. History of polymorphic ventricular fibrillation or torsade de pointes,\n      2. Permanent atrial fibrillation [a fib], defined as continuous a fib for ≥ 6 months,\n      3.
