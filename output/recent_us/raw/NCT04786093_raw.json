    "inclusion_criteria": "* patients with medically refractory epilepsy who are scheduled to undergo or have previously undergone placement of sub-dural electrodes (including depth electrodes) to localize the site of seizure onset and to map the locations of critical language and motor regions\n* patients with epilepsy, brain tumors or cortically based vascular malformations (cavernous malformations or arterio-venous malformations) with lesions that are/were proximate to crucial brain regions, and who are scheduled to undergo or have previously undergone intra-op mapping of motor, visual or language function, or a Wada test, or maybe part of an awake craniotomy.\n* proficiency in English\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 75 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Gross structural abnormalities (large hamartomata, tumors, large vascular malformations, very large diffuse malformations of cortical development) that may have impacted upon the location of critical brain areas.\n* Unable to participate in testing due to impaired cognition or mental retardation.\n* Cardiac pacemakers, intracranial aneurysm clips, or other potentially mobile implanted metallic devices\n* Patients with claustrophobia who cannot undergo an MRI scan without sedation",
