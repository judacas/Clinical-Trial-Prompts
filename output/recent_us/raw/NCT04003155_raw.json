    "exclusion_criteria": "* Urinary diversion with an orthotopic neobladder\n* History of inflammatory bowel disease\n* Prior partial or complete small bowel obstruction either before or after radical cystectomy\n* Prior radiotherapy to the pelvis;\n\n  o Prior radiation therapy for a different cancer or disease process is allowed, provided there will be no overlap of radiation therapy fields between the participant's prior and current course of radiation therapy, radiotherapy was completed more than four weeks from enrolling in this study.\n* Planned concurrent chemotherapy or other investigational drug to be given with radiation treatments\n\n  o Prior chemotherapy or investigational drug for bladder cancer or a different cancer is allowed, provided that:\n  * The therapy was completed more than two weeks prior to the start of adjuvant pelvic radiation\n  * The participant has recovered to Grade â‰¤1 toxicity from agents previously administered, excluding toxicities that would not be expected to impact eligibility for radiation therapy including but not limited to neuropathy, alopecia and hearing loss.\n* Subtotal surgical resection with clinically evident residual disease by physical exam or axial imaging.\n* Prior or concurrent second invasive malignancy that, in the judgment of the investigator, may affect interpretation of the results.\n* Known severe, active co-morbidity, defined as follows:\n\n  o Any clinically significant unrelated systemic illness, medical condition, or other factor, which at the discretion of the Principal Investigators, would interfere in the safe and timely completion of study procedures, compromise the patient's ability to tolerate the protocol therapy, or is likely to interfere with the study procedures or results.\n* Patients who experienced Grade 3+ GI toxicity due to surgery or nivolumab prior to enrollment in the trial",
