    "inclusion_criteria": "Age\n\n1. Participant must be 21 to 64 years of age, inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent form.\n\nType of Participant and Disease Characteristics\n\n1. Participant has a body mass index (BMI) between 18.5 and 29.9\n2. Have a clinical diagnosis of IBS (any subtype) as defined by the Rome IV clinical criteria:\n3. Abdominal pain at least 4 days per month over at least 2 months associated with one or more of the following:\n\n   i. Related to defecation ii. A change in frequency of stool iii.

This means the patient's primary gastroenterologist will document that they have conducted an evaluation that is within appropriate standards of practice to exclude other medical conditions, and that in their opinion irritable bowel syndrome is the most appropriate diagnosis. The patient's primary gastroenterologist will also document that they have discussed this evaluation and diagnosis with the patient.\n   3. tried at least one dietary intervention by history\n   4. tried at least one pharmacologic agent for at least six weeks by history\n5.

Subjects will be excluded if they cannot use highly effective birth control for any reason. If a potential subject lives in an area where local regulations preclude the use of adequate contraception (intrauterine device, injected/implanted/intravaginal/transdermal hormonal method, oral hormones plus a barrier contraception, abstinence, vasectomized sole partner, or double barrier contraception), study enrollment will not be allowed.\n\n    1. If a participant is opting for abstinence as their birth control method, only true/total abstinence is permitted. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods), lactational amenorrhea, and withdrawal are not acceptable. Counseling regarding the importance of maintaining abstinence, and the potential risks of exposure to a developing embryo or fetus will be provided during the preparatory sessions during the Preparation 1 session, Integration 1 session, and during Deep Phenotyping 2.\n    2. Females of reproductive potential must agree to use effective birth control for the duration of active intervention (defined as the time from the Baseline [deep phenotyping] visit until 6 months and 3 days (for female subjects) after Deep Phenotyping/EOT visit.
