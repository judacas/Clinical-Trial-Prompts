    "inclusion_criteria": "* Age >= 18 and =< 70 years\n* Patients with acute myeloid leukemia both flt3 positive and negative\n* Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical sibling or 8/8 matched unrelated donor available\n* Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks (3 months)\n* Direct bilirubin =< 1 mg/dL\n* Alanine transaminase (ALT) =< 3 x upper limit of normal\n* Serum creatinine =< 1.5 x the upper limit of normal\n* Creatinine clearance >= 50\n* Diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) > 50% of predicted corrected for hemoglobin\n* Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) >= 50%\n* Subjects must be able to understand and be willing to sign the written informed consent form. A signed informed consent form must be appropriately obtained prior to the conduct of any trial-specific procedure\n* Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test performed within 7 days prior to the start of study drug.

Patients with bleeding due to prior thrombocytopenia are permitted\n* Subject with any pulmonary hemorrhage/bleeding event of NCI-CTCAE v. 4.0 grade 2 or higher within 4 weeks before randomization; any other hemorrhage/bleeding event of NCI-CTCAE v. 4.0 grade 3 or higher within 4 weeks before randomization\n* Subjects with thrombotic, embolic, venous, or arterial cerebrovascular event (including transient ischemic attacks) within 6 months of informed consent\n* Subjects who have used strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, St. John's wort [Hypericum perforatum], dexamethasone at a dose of greater than 16 mg daily, or rifampin [rifampicin], and/or rifabutin) within 28 days before randomization\n* Subjects with any previously untreated or concurrent cancer except cervical cancer in-situ, treated basal cell carcinoma, or superficial bladder tumor. Subjects surviving a cancer that was curatively treated and without evidence of disease for more than 3 years before randomization are allowed. All cancer treatments must be completed at least 3 years prior to study entry (i.e., signature date of the informed consent form)\n* Presence of a non-healing wound, non-healing ulcer, or bone fracture\n* History of organ allograft (including corneal transplant)\n* Known or suspected allergy or hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs, study drug classes, or excipients of the formulations given during the course of this trial\n* Any malabsorption condition\n* Women who are pregnant or breast-feeding\n* Inability to comply with the protocol and/or not willing or not available for follow-up assessments\n* Any medical, psychological, or psychosocial condition which, in the investigator's opinion, makes the subject unsuitable for trial participation\n* Major surgery within 30 days prior to start of study drug\n* Patients who received inotuzumab and/or gemtuzumab in the past\n* Therapeutic anticoagulation with vitamin-K antagonists (e.g., warfarin) or with heparins and heparinoids\n\n  * However, prophylactic anticoagulation as described below is allowed:\n\n    * Low dose warfarin (1 mg orally, once daily) with prothrombin time international normalized ratio (PT-INR). =< 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) is permitted. Infrequent bleeding or elevations in PT-INR have been reported in some subjects taking warfarin while on sorafenib or capecitabine therapy. Therefore, subjects taking concomitant warfarin should be monitored regularly for changes in PT, PT-INR or clinical bleeding episodes\n    * Low dose aspirin (=< 100 mg daily)\n    * Prophylactic doses of heparin or low molecular weight heparin",
