    "inclusion_criteria": "* INCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\nMalignancy diagnosis requirements:\n\n-Eligible diagnoses include AML (acute myeloid leukemia), MDS (myelodysplastic syndrome), CMML(chronic myelomonocytic leukemia), CML (chronic myeloid leukemia), and T-ALL (T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma) meeting standard diagnostic criteria as described in the 5th edition World Health Organization Classification of Hematologic Tumors and/or the International Consensus Classification of Myeloid Neoplasms and Acute Leukemias. Multiple myeloma participants meeting International Working Group diagnostic criteria are eligible. These diagnostic criteria can be met at any time during the course of the participant s malignancy. Atypical CML is not an eligible diagnosis.\n\nNOTE: Pathology reports are acceptable to confirm eligibility.\n\nMalignancy mutation and HLA requirements:\n\n* Detection of at least one of the neoepitope-forming TP53 or RAS mutations that are listed in Table 3 in on the TruSight Oncology (TSO) 500 sequencing panel (NSR device) performed in the NCI Laboratory of Pathology is required. RAS mutations can be in NRAS, KRAS or HRAS as these oncogenes have the same amino acid sequence at the location of the targeted neoepitopes. A variant allele frequency (VAF) of at least 5% is required for a mutation to be eligible. This criterion can be met at any time within 60 days prior to apheresis regardless of treatment history during this 60-day period. DNA for sequencing comes from bone marrow.\n* Presence of the correct HLA type needed to present one of the targeted neoepitopes as shown in Table 3.
