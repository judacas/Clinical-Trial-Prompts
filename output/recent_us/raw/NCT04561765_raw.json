Participants with NSCLC characterized by known driver mutations must have had disease progression on, or have intolerance to, appropriate targeted therapies as per local standard of care. Participants may have received prior therapy with amivantamab as long as discontinuation was not due to toxicity. Participants with EGFR mutation must not have had an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy, Phase 2 Expansion Cohorts; Cohort A: Participant's tumor must have an EGFR exon19del or L858R mutation, as determined by local molecular testing, Cohort B: Participants must have tumors lacking known primary driver mutations and must have PD-L1 expression of greater than or equal to (>=)50 percentage (%), per local testing, and are treatment-na√Øve in the metastatic setting\n* Participant must have at least 1 measurable lesion, according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1, that has not been previously irradiated\n* Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",

Ongoing or active infection (includes infection requiring treatment with antimicrobial therapy [participants will be required to complete antibiotics 1 week prior to starting study treatment] or diagnosed or suspected viral infection), c. Active bleeding diathesis, d. Impaired oxygenation requiring continuous oxygen supplementation, e. Psychiatric illness or any other circumstances (including social circumstances) that would limit compliance with study requirements\n* Medical history of (non-infectious) interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis, or has current ILD/pneumonitis, or where suspected ILD/pneumonitis cannot be ruled out by imaging at screening\n* Has an active autoimmune disease or a documented history of autoimmune disease that requires systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents\n* Participant has received radiotherapy for palliative purposes less than 14 days prior to the first dose of study treatment\n* Participant has a.
