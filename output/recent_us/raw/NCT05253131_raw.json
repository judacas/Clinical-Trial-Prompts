    "exclusion_criteria": "* Patients with concurrent upper urinary tract (i.e. ureter, renal pelvis) non-invasive urothelial carcinoma.\n* Patients with high grade urothelial carcinoma on their most recent urine cytology.\n* Patients with another active second malignancy other than non-melanoma skin cancers and biochemical relapsed prostate cancer. (Patients that have completed all necessary therapy and are considered to be at less than 30% risk of relapse are not considered to have an active second malignancy and are eligible for enrollment.)\n* Patients who have received the last administration of an anti-cancer therapy including chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and monoclonal antibodies ≤ 4 weeks prior to starting study drug, or who have not recovered from the side effects of such therapy\n* Patients who have received prior selective fibroblast growth factor receptor targeting agents (i.e. pemigatinib, dovitinib, BGJ398, AZD4547, JNJ-42756493, etc.).\n* Patients who have had radiotherapy ≤ 4 weeks prior to starting study drug, or who have not recovered from radiotherapy toxicities\n* Patients who have undergone major surgery (e.g. intra-thoracic, intra-abdominal or intra-pelvic), open biopsy or significant traumatic injury ≤ 4 weeks prior to starting study drug, or patients who have had minor procedures (i.e. TURBT), percutaneous biopsies or placement of vascular access device ≤ 1 week prior to starting study drug, or who have not recovered from side effects of such procedure or injury",
