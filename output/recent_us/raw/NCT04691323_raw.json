    "inclusion_criteria": "* Women â‰¥ 18 years of age\n* Have a clinical diagnosis of endocrine therapy induced alopecia (EIA) for breast cancer:\n\n  * Selective estrogen receptor modulators (tamoxifen, toremifene)\n  * Aromatase inhibitors (anastrozole, letrozole, exemestane)\n  * Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (leuprolide)\n\nOR\n\n* Must have a clinical diagnosis of chemotherapy induced (pCIA) alopecia with incomplete or absent regrowth of hair > 3 months after completion of chemotherapy without use of endocrine cancer-related therapy (ET) within the last 6 months\n* Ludwig stage 1-3 for women\n* If patient has a history of use of topical minoxidil and/or systemic spironolactone for alopecia for at least three consecutive months, then a 3 month washout is required prior to start of treatment\n* Completed informed consent form\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 60 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding\n* History of hair transplantation\n* Use of any cosmetic product aimed at improving or correcting the signs of hair loss within 2weeks prior to screening. Note: patients are not permitted to use any hair loss products during the study.\n* An active scalp dermatologic condition (e.g. alopecia areata, scalp psoriasis), scalp skin cancer (e.g. BCC, SCC), a pre-existing condition with sequelae on the scalp (e.g. scarring alopecia) or acute infection.\n* Hereditary or acquired hematologic/coagulation disorders such as: platelet dysfunction syndrome, critical thrombocytopenia (platelet count <150,000 platelets/ul),hypofibrinogenemia, impaired coagulation, drepanocytosis (sickle cell anemia).\n* Actively receiving anticoagulant medication\n* Patients taking Aspirin or other NSAIDs such as Nurofen, Voltaren, Diclofenac or Naproxen, or fish-oil supplements because of its anti-platelet activity, can participate, provided medication is interrupted 7 days before beginning of the treatment.\n* Planned or previous radiation therapy to the brain\n* Vulnerable populations e.g. decisionally impaired (cognitive, psychiatric) or patients who, in the opinion of the investigator have a condition that precludes their ability to provide an informed consent\n* Patients taking hair supplements, such as biotin or biosil, can participate, provided hair supplements are washed out 3 months prior to beginning of treatment.",
