Palliative radiation for the alleviation of pain due to bone metastasis will be allowed during the study\n* Systemic anti cancer therapy within 2 weeks of first dose of study drug (6 weeks for bicalutamide, mitomycin C, or nitrosoureas and 4 weeks for abiraterone). Patients are ineligible if they received any other type of anti cancer agent (except agents to maintain castrate status) within 2 weeks before first dose of study drug.\n\nPart B:\n\n* Patients with known symptomatic brain metastases requiring steroids (above physiologic replacement doses)\n* Major surgery (as defined by the Investigator) within 4 weeks of first dose of study drug.\n* Radiation therapy within 4 weeks of first dose of study drug or prior irradiation to >25% of the bone marrow.
