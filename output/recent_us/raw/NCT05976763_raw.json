The following exceptions are permitted:\n\n  * Alopecia, fatigue, and lymphopenia due to prior therapies.\n  * Toxicities attributed to prior anti-cancer therapy that are not expected to resolve and to result in long lasting sequelae (e.g., neuropathy after platinum-based therapy), may be permitted\n* PRIMARY TREATMENT: Palliative radiation therapy completed ≥ two weeks prior to start of SMMART-ACT treatment to a measurable disease lesion(s)\n* PRIMARY TREATMENT: Study intervention-specific eligibility criteria for the intended, recommended therapy must also be met\n* CANCER-SPECIFIC CRITERIA (BREAST CANCER): Lesion(s) remain measurable after systemic therapies, as follows:\n\n  * At least one prior line of pharmacological therapy for hormone receptor (HR) positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative disease.\n  * At least one prior line of targeted therapy for HER2-positive disease\n  * At least one prior line of combination therapy for triple negative disease lacking a BRCA1/2 mutation.\n  * At least one prior line of therapy with a PARP inhibitor for triple negative disease with a BRCA1/2 mutation\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* PRE-SCREENING: Evidence of active malignancy of another cancer with a natural history or treatment history that may affect safety or efficacy assessments of this study or impose unacceptable risk to the participant.

If treatment within the first cycle of therapy is unlikely to be required, enrollment may be considered, as per the investigator\n* PRIMARY TREATMENT: Concurrent forms of anti-cancer therapy that have the potential to interfere with efficacy and safety assessments or that may pose increased risk to the participant while on a SMMART-ACT treatment, and as per the investigator (Select hormone therapies are allowed)\n* PRIMARY TREATMENT: More than one intervening line of therapy for treatment of their cancer since the time of the pre-screening biopsy, exclusive of most maintenance hormone therapies\n\n  * Note: Participants who have a pre-screening biopsy while receiving a standard of care (SOC) treatment will not be eligible if they receive any additional lines of treatment prior to the start of SMMART-ACT treatment. This treatment will count as one line of intervening therapy\n* PRIMARY TREATMENT: Untreated and/or uncured hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, as evidenced by detectable hepatitis B core (HBC) ribonucleic acid (RNA) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Prior treatment, concurrent treatment, and natural resolution of HCV infection are not exclusionary given (1) no risk for hepatic decompensation and (2) the intended SMMART-ACT treatment is not expected to exacerbate HCV infection\n* PRIMARY TREATMENT: Uncontrolled intercurrent illness and infection that may interfere with planned treatment, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\n  * Symptomatic congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class III or IV),\n  * Unstable angina pectoris or coronary angioplasty, or stenting within < six months prior to enrollment,\n  * Cardiac arrhythmia (ongoing cardiac dysrhythmias of grade ≥ 2 [National Cancer Institute (NCI) CTCAE v 5.0]),\n  * Conditions that require intra-cardiac defibrillators,\n  * Known cardiac metastases,\n  * History of abnormal cardiac valve morphology (≥ grade 2),\n  * Chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD) or immunosuppressive therapy for the control of GVHD\n* PRIMARY TREATMENT: Severe infection within < four weeks prior to initiation of study therapy, including, but not limited to, hospitalization for complications of infection, bacteremia, or severe pneumonia\n* PRIMARY TREATMENT: Inability or unwillingness to take oral medication (only for assigned oral study interventions)\n* PRIMARY TREATMENT: History of allergy to an assigned study agent or its excipients\n* PRIMARY TREATMENT: Current pregnancy, current breastfeeding, or unwillingness to not breastfeed while receiving study drug(s) or for the minimum required time after the last dose of study drug(s) as specified by the SMMART-ACT drug agents\n* PRIMARY TREATMENT: Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, could jeopardize the participant's safety or adherence to the study protocol\n* CANCER-SPECIFIC CRITERIA (PROSTATE CANCER): If the screening bone scan shows a \"superscan\" participants will be excluded from participation.
