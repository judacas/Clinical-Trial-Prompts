The effects of obinutuzumab on the developing human fetus is unknown. For these reasons, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception as described below.\n* For women of childbearing potential:\n\n  * Agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use a contraceptive method with a failure rate of < 1% per year as outlined below.\n  * Female subjects of childbearing potential (FCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL within 10-14 days and again within 24 hours prior to prescribing Revlimid(R) for Cycle 1 (prescriptions must be filled within 7 days as required by Revlimid REMS(TM) and must either commit to continued abstinence from heterosexual intercourse or begin TWO acceptable methods of birth control, one highly effective method and one additional effective method AT THE SAME TIME, at least 28 days before she starts taking Revlimid(R). FCBP must also agree to ongoing pregnancy testing.\n  * A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarcheal, has not reached a postmenopausal state (greater than or equal to 12 continuous months of amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone surgical sterilization (removal of ovaries and/or uterus).\n  * Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of less than 1% per year include bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, hormonal contraceptives that inhibit ovulation, hormone-releasing intrauterine devices, and copper intrauterine devices.\n  * The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.\n* For men:\n\n  * Agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive measures, and agreement to refrain from donating sperm, as defined below:\n  * With female partners of childbearing potential, men must remain abstinent or use a condom plus an additional contraceptive method that together result in a failure rate of less than 1% per year as noted below. Men must refrain from donating sperm during this same period.\n  * With pregnant female partners, men must remain abstinent or use a condom as noted below to avoid exposing the embryo.\n  * The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.\n* Contraception Requirements:\n\nPre-Treatment/During Treatment:\n\n--All Drugs- Women- begins 28 days prior to treatment; Men- Begins on day 1\n\nPost-Treatment:\n\n* Venetoclax- Women- 90 days; Men 90 days\n* Ibrutinib- Women- 3 months; Men- 3 months\n* Obinutuzumab- Women- 18 months; Men- 6 months\n* Revlimid- Women-28 days; Men- 28 days\n\n  * All study participants must be registered into the mandatory Revlimid REMS(TM) program and be willing and able to comply with the requirements of Revlimid REMS(TM). NOTE: Females of reproductive potential must adhere to the scheduled pregnancy testing as required in the Revlimid REMS(TM) program\n  * Ability of subject to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\nThe following restrictions apply to current or prior anti-cancer treatment, prior to the first dose of study drug:\n\n* Patients who are actively receiving any other investigational agents.\n* Any chemotherapy, external beam radiation therapy, or anti-cancer antibodies within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug\n* Radio- or toxin-immunoconjugates within 10 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug\n* Previous treatment with greater than one of the study agents (i.e., venetoclax, ibrutinib or Revlimid(R)), excluding prior prednisone or anti-CD20 antibody treatment\n* Prior allogeneic stem cell (or other organ) transplant within 6 months or any evidence of active graft-versus-host disease or requirement for immunosuppressants within 28 days prior to first dose of study drug\n* Not recovered (i.e., less than or equal to Grade 1 or baseline) from adverse events due to previously administered anti-cancer treatment, surgery, or procedure. NOTE: Exceptions to this include events not considered to place the subject at unacceptable risk of participation in the opinion of the PI (e.g., alopecia).\n\n  * Patients requiring the use of warfarin are excluded because of potential drug-drug interactions that may potentially increase the exposure of warfarin.\n  * Patients requiring the following agents within 7 days prior to the first dose of venetoclax are excluded:\n* Strong CYP3A inhibitors\n* Strong CYP3A inducers\n\nNOTE: Moderate CYP3A inhibitors and inducers should be used with caution and an alternative medication used, whenever possible.\n\nUncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to the following that may limit interpretation of results or that could increase risk to the patient at the discretion of the investigator:\n\n* Symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia\n* Uncontrolled and/or symptomatic thyroid disease\n* Known active bacterial, viral, fungal, mycobacterial, parasitic, or other infection (excluding fungal infections of nail beds) at study enrollment, or any major episode of infection requiring treatment with IV antibiotics or hospitalization (relating to the completion of the course of antibiotics) within 2 weeks prior to Cycle 1, Day 1;\n* Known infection with human T-cell leukemia virus 1 (HTLV-1)\n* Clinically significant history of liver disease, including viral or other hepatitis, current alcohol abuse, or cirrhosis; as well as active infection with HBV or HCV:\n\n  --Patients who are positive for HCV antibody must be negative for HCV by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to be eligible for study participation\n* Patients with occult or prior HBV infection (defined as positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or positive hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) with negative HBsAg) may be included if HBV DNA is undetectable. These patients must be willing to undergo HBV DNA testing during treatment and in surveillance for at least 12 months after completion of study therapy.\n* Malabsorption syndrome or other condition that precludes enteral route of administration\n* Psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements\n* Pregnant women, or women who intend to become pregnant during the study, are excluded from this study because Revlimid(R) has known teratogenic effects and venetoclax, ibrutinib and obinutuzumab are agents with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with these agents, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated on study.\n* HIV-positive patients are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with venetoclax, ibrutinib and Revlimid(R) and combination antiretroviral therapy. In addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.\n* Evidence of active tumor lysis syndrome based on laboratory assessment\n* History of recent major surgery within 6 weeks prior to the start of Cycle 1, Day 1 other than for diagnosis\n* History of other active malignancy that could affect compliance with the protocol or interpretation of results\n\n  * Patients with a history of curatively treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma or stage 1 melanoma of the skin as well as any in situ carcinoma are eligible.\n  * Patients with a malignancy that has been treated with curative intent will also be eligible. Individuals in documented remission without treatment for greater than or equal to 2 years prior to enrollment may be included at the discretion of the investigator.\n* Known allergy to both xanthine oxidase inhibitors and rasburicase; or, known hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
