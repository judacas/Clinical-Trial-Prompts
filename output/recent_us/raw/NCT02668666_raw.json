Note: Hydroxyurea may be used to control leukocytosis for the first 28 days of study treatment (i.e., cycle 1). Use of hydroxyurea beyond this point may be permitted as clinically indicated, on a case-by-case basis and after discussion with the principal investigator (PI). (repeat if more than 3 days before the first dose)\n* Female patients who:\n\n  * Are postmenopausal for at least 1 year before the screening visit, OR\n  * Are surgically sterile, OR\n  * If they are of childbearing potential:\n\n    * Agree to practice 1 highly effective method and 1 additional effective (barrier) method of contraception, at the same time, from the time of signing the informed consent through 4 months after the last dose of study drug (female and male condoms should not be used together), or\n    * Agree to practice true abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. (Periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods] withdrawal, spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea are not acceptable methods of contraception)\n* Male patients, even if surgically sterilized (i.e., status postvasectomy), who:\n\n  * Agree to practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study treatment period and through 4 months after the last dose of study drug (female and male condoms should not be used together), or\n  * Agree to practice true abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. (Periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods for the female partner] withdrawal, spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea are not acceptable methods of contraception.)\n* Voluntary written consent must be given before performance of any study related procedure\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
