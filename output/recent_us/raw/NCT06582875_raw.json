Radiation therapy must have been completed >= 1 week prior to starting treatment. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of localized lesions should have been performed >= 1 week prior to starting treatment. All radiation-related toxicity must have resolved to < grade 2.\n\n  * Palliative radiotherapy is permitted between disease progression on Arm 1 and crossover to a combination therapy arm (Arms 2-7), provided there is a washout period of >= 1 week and any toxicity from radiation has resolved to < grade 2\n  * Patients on any arm may receive palliative radiotherapy or loco-regional ablative therapy and remain on study, provided the radiation is not delivered to the target lesion and the patient does not have tumor progression by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)\n* Treatment with systemic immunostimulatory agents (including, but not limited to, interferon-alpha or interleukin-2) must have been completed at least 6 weeks before the first dose of durvalumab.\n* Body weight > 30 kg.\n* Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected (HIV1/2 antibody-positive) patients may participate if they meet all the following eligibility requirements:\n\n  * They must be on an anti-retroviral regimen with evidence of at least two undetectable viral loads within the past 6 months on this same regimen; the most recent undetectable viral load must be within the past 12 weeks.\n  * They must have a CD4 count >= 250 cells/uL over the past 6 months on this same anti-retroviral regimen and must not have had a CD4 count < 200 cells/uL over the past 2 years, unless it was deemed related to chemotherapy-induced bone marrow suppression.\n\n    * For patients who have received chemotherapy in the past 6 months, a CD4 count < 250 cells/uL during chemotherapy is permitted as long as viral loads were undetectable during this same chemotherapy.\n  * They must have an undetectable viral load and a CD4 count >= 250 cells/uL within 28 days of enrollment.\n  * They must not be currently receiving prophylactic therapy for an opportunistic infection and must not have had an opportunistic infection within the past 6 months.\n  * Monitoring for HIV-infected patients should include:\n\n    * Viral load and CD4 count every 8-10 weeks.\n* The effects of targeted agents on the developing human fetus are unknown. The cytotoxic agents chosen for combination with durvalumab adversely affect human fertility and gestation. For these reasons, women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use highly effective contraception prior to study entry for the duration of study participation and for 6 months following the last dose of a study drug.\n* Because there may be a risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with these agents, breastfeeding should be discontinued while the patient is on this trial and for 6 months following the last dose of study drug.\n* Patients should be willing not to donate blood while participating in this study or for at least 90 days following the last dose of study drug.\n* Left ventricular ejection fraction greater than 50% or the institutional lower limit of normal by echocardiography (ECHO) at entry (patients enrolling on Arm 3 only).\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Patients who received prior therapy with a checkpoint inhibitor and were taken off drug for serious adverse events are excluded. Patients who had prior CTLA-4 inhibitor treatment and did not experience serious adverse events are eligible for all arms. Patients who had prior PD-L1/PD-1 inhibitor treatment and did not experience serious adverse events are excluded from the durvalumab monotherapy arm but are eligible for the chemotherapy combinations.\n* Patients with pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, or microsatellite stable (MSS) colorectal cancer, or other histologies where clinical evidence exists that single-agent inhibition of PD-L1/PD-1 has minimal activity will not receive single-agent durvalumab but may be eligible to receive this agent with chemotherapy (Arms 2-7).\n* Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.\n* Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.

Patients taking enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants (i.e., carbamazepine, fosphenytoin, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone) will only be eligible for Arm 1 (durvalumab monotherapy) and Arm 2 (durvalumab + gemcitabine).\n* Patients receiving warfarin are not eligible for Arm 4 (capecitabine) due to the potential for life-threatening interactions. Patients on warfarin are eligible to enroll in one of the other arms provided there is increased vigilance with respect to monitoring international normalized ratio (INR)\n* Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, myocardial infarction in the past 6 months, invasive fungal infections, or active (acute or chronic) or uncontrolled severe infection, liver disease such as cirrhosis, decompensated liver disease, and active and chronic hepatitis (i.e., quantifiable hepatitis B virus [HBV]-deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA] and/or positive hepatitis B surface antigen [HbsAg], quantifiable HCV-ribonucleic acid [RNA]), are not eligible to participate.
