    "inclusion_criteria": "The main inclusion criteria include but are not limited to the following:\n\n* Have histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate without small cell histology\n* Has current evidence of metastatic disease documented by either bone lesions on bone scan and/or soft tissue disease shown by computed tomography scan (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\n* Has prostate cancer progression while receiving androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) (or post bilateral orchiectomy) within 6 months before screening\n* Has disease that progressed during or after treatment with one next-generation hormonal agent (NHA) for hormone sensitive prostate cancer (HSPC) metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) or non metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer (nmHSPC), for at least 8 weeks (at least 14 weeks for participants with bone progression) Note: Participants may have received abiraterone acetate and docetaxel or darolutamide and docetaxel for HSPC. However, participants must have received no more than six cycles of docetaxel and had no radiographic disease progression while receiving docetaxel\n* Has an eastern clinical oncology group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 assessed within 7 days before randomization\n* Has ongoing androgen deprivation with serum testosterone <50 ng/dL (<1.7 nM)\n* Has had prior treatment with Poly polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) or were deemed ineligible to receive treatment by the investigator or have refused PARPi treatment\n* Has adequate organ function\n* Has provided tumor tissue from a fresh core or excisional biopsy from soft tissue not previously irradiated. Samples from tumors progressing at a prior site of radiation are allowed\n* Participants who are hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive are eligible if they have received hepatitis B virus (HBV) antiviral therapy for at least 4 weeks and have undetectable HBV viral load before randomization\n* Participants with history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are eligible if HCV viral load is undetectable at Screening\n* Participants who have adverse event (AEs) due to previous anticancer therapies must have recovered to ≤Grade 1 or baseline. Participants with endocrine-related AEs who are adequately treated with hormone replacement therapy (HRT) or participants who have ≤Grade 2 neuropathy are eligible\n* Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected participants must have well controlled HIV on antiretroviral therapy (ART)\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
