    "exclusion_criteria": "* Any exposure to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICIs) since the time of first being diagnosed with uveal melanoma.\n* Known acute or chronic Hepatitis B or C infection or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or any other uncontrolled infection.\n* Current active significant herpetic infections or prior complications of HSV-1 infection.\n* Any central nervous system (CNS) involvement of melanoma, including carcinomatous meningitis.\n* Major surgery ≤ 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study intervention.\n* Any bleeding, thrombotic and/or other event that places the patient at an unacceptable risk of complications of intratumoral therapy.\n* Active, known, or suspected autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment.\n* Prior treatment with an oncolytic virus.\n* Requires intermittent or chronic use of systemic (oral or IV) antivirals with known antiherpetic activity (eg, acyclovir).\n* Systemic anticancer therapy or prior radiotherapy within 2 weeks of the first dose.\n* Has received Investigation agent within 4 weeks or 5 half-lives (whichever longer) prior to the first dose.\n* Conditions requiring treatment with immunosuppressive doses (> 10 mg per day of prednisone or equivalent) of systemic corticosteroids other than for corticosteroid replacement therapy within 14 days after enrollment.\n\nAdditional inclusion/ exclusion criteria are outlined in the study protocol",
