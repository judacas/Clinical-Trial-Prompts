    "official_title": "Hyperpolarized 13C Pyruvate Metabolic MRI to Predict Renal Tumor Aggressiveness",
    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Renal tumor measuring 1 cm and greater in diameter. To minimize any potential partial volume effects in this pilot study, the investigators have limited the lower size range of the tumor to 1 cm. The investigators will include all renal tumor measuring 1 cm and greater in diameter in this first study to facilitate obtaining tumors of a range of histology and grade.\n2. The participant is being considered by the treating physician to have any of the following management options: partial or radical nephrectomy, ablation, or active surveillance for his/her renal tumor.\n3. The participant is able and willing to comply with study procedures and provide signed and dated informed consent.\n4. The participant is willing to undergo standard of care abdominal MRI in connection with the study exam.\n5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Participants who because of age, general medical or psychiatric condition, or physiologic status cannot give valid informed consent.\n2. Participants unwilling or unable to undergo magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, including patients with contra-indications to MR imaging, such as cardiac pacemakers or non-compatible intracranial vascular clips.\n3. Any metallic implant or device that distorts local magnetic field and compromises the quality of MR imaging of the abdomen.\n4. Prior focal therapy (i.e. ablation) for the renal tumor.\n5. Poorly controlled hypertension, with blood pressure at study entry >160/100. The addition of anti-hypertensives to control blood pressure is allowed for eligibility determination.\n6. Congestive heart failure or New York Heart Association (NYHA) status >= 2.",
