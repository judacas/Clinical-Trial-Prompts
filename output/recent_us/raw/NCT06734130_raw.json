    "exclusion_criteria": "* Prior RT that would result in overlap of RT fields with the planned study treatment\n* Clinically significant cardiac disease, including major cardiac dysfunction, that in the opinion of the treating medical oncologist would preclude them from receiving systemic therapy with 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin or oxaliplatin.\n* Serious (ie, ≥ grade 3) uncontrolled infection\n* Pulmonary or respiratory condition that, in the opinion of the treating medical oncologist would preclude them from receiving systemic therapy with 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin or oxaliplatin.\n* Major surgery within 28 days of study enrollment (other than diverting colostomy)\n* History of inflammatory bowel disease (eg, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis) requiring significant intervention (eg, hospitalization, surgery, immunosuppressive medications) that would, in the opinion of the investigator, preclude study therapy\n* Prior known allergic reaction to 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, or oxaliplatin\n* Known dipyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency (DPD)\n* Any evidence of distant metastases (M1)\n* Pregnant or breast feeding\n* Medical, psychological, or social condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, may increase the patient's risk or limit the patient's adherence with study requirements",
