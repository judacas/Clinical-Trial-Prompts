    "inclusion_criteria": "Inclusion and exclusion criteria were reviewed for each potential patient during Screening. All eligible patients were treated with Tinostamustine employing sequential enrollment (i.e. as they qualify for participation). In the first phase of the trial (Phase 1), the dose received for each eligible patient was dependent on the requirements of the dose escalation scheme at the time the patient was enrolled. In the second phase of the trial (Phase 2), all patients were treated with the Tinostamustine at 80 mg/m2 administered over 1 hour on Day 1 and 15 of each 4-week treatment cycle.\n\nGeneral Inclusion Criteria for Phase 1 and Phase 2 portions of Study:\n\n1. Patient willing and able to sign the informed consent.\n2. Patients age ≥18 years at signing the informed consent.\n3. Life expectancy > 3 months.\n4. Histologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced or metastatic solid tumors, disease should have progressed following at least one line of therapy and no other standard therapy with proven clinical benefit is available or recommended based on the investigator's individual risk-benefit assessment for the patient.\n5. Patients with secondary metastasis to the central nervous system (CNS) are eligible if they have had brain metastases resected or have received radiation therapy ending at least 4 weeks prior to trial day 1 and they meet all of the following criteria:\n\n   1. Residual neurological symptoms ≤Grade 1.\n   2. No glucocorticoids requirement or patients may be receiving low doses of glucocorticoids providing the dose has been stable for at least 2 weeks prior to starting the trial medication.\n   3. Follow-up imaging studies show no progression of treated lesions and no new lesions.\n6. Evaluable disease; measurable on imaging as assessed by RECIST version 1.1.\n7. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 2.\n8. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) (polymorphonuclear cells [PMN] plus bands) >1,000/ μL.\n9. Platelets ≥100,000 μL. Platelet transfusions within the 14 days before Day 1 of Cycle 1 is prohibited.\n10. Aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase (AST/ALT) ≤ 3 upper limit of normal (ULN). In cases with liver involvement ALT/ AST ≤ 5× ULN.\n11. Total bilirubin ≤1.5 mg/dL unless elevated due to known Gilbert's syndrome.\n12. Creatinine ≤1.5 ULN.\n13. Serum potassium and magnesium at least at the lowest limit of normal (LLN), before every IMP administration. If it is below the LLN, supplementation is permissible.\n14. Female study participants of child-bearing potential and their partners, and male study participants who intend to be sexually active with a woman of child-bearing potential, must be willing to use at least two (2) highly effective forms of contraception. This should start from the time of study enrollment and continue throughout IMP administration. For female study participants of child-bearing potential this must continue using contraception for at least six (6) months after the last administration of the IMP. Female study participants should be willing to have a pregnancy test performed at screening, ≤ 1 day prior to day 1 of each IMP administration and at study treatment discontinuation. Male study participants who are sexually active with a woman of child-bearing potential should also use a condom during treatment and for at least ninety (90) days after the last administration of IMP. Vasectomized males are considered fertile; therefore, vasectomized partners and patients must be willing to use a secondary method of effective birth control. Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the trial treatment. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.\n\nExclusion Criteria Phase 1 and Phase 2 portions of Study:\n\nTo be eligible to participate in the trial, a patient cannot meet any of the following exclusion criteria:\n\n1. Patients with primary central nervous system (CNS) cancer.\n2. Patients with QTc interval (Fridericia's formula) >450 msec.\n3.
