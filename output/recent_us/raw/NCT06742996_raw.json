Documented history of MI ii. Prior coronary revascularisation procedure iii. greater than or equal to 50% stenosis in major epicardial coronary artery documented by cardiac catheterisation or CT coronary angiography b) Cerebrovascular disease defined as at least one of the following: i. Prior stroke of atherosclerotic origin ii. Prior carotid artery revascularisation procedure iii. greater than or equal to 50% stenosis in carotid artery documented by X-ray angiography, MR angiography, CT angiography or Doppler ultrasound.\n\n  c) Symptomatic peripheral artery disease (PAD) defined as at least one of the following: i. Intermittent claudication with an ankle-brachial index (ABI) below or equal to 0.90 at rest ii. Intermittent claudication with a greater than or equal to 50% stenosis in peripheral artery (excluding carotid) documented by X-ray angiography, MR angiography, CT angiography or Doppler ultrasound iii.
