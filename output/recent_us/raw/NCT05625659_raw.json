    "inclusion_criteria": "* Age >= 18 years\n* Female\n* Resected unilateral or bilateral primary carcinoma of the breast without clinical evidence of metastatic disease (after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and/or adjuvant chemotherapy), negative for estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) (cut-off for positivity is > 10% positive tumor cells with nuclear staining), and negative for HER2 as defined by one of the four situations delineated below:\n\n  * HER2 immunohistochemistry (IHC) expression of 0 or 1+ and in-situ hybridization non-amplified\n  * HER2 IHC expression of 0 or 1+ and in-situ hybridization not done\n  * HER2 IHC expression of 2+ and in-situ hybridization non-amplified\n  * IHC not done and in-situ hybridization non-amplified\n  * Note: central review is not required\n  * Note: If biopsy and surgical specimens are discordant from each other with regard to ER, PR, and/or HER2 status, a patient will be allowed to enroll assuming at least one of the specimens meets the above criteria and no endocrine therapy use is planned going forward\n* Completed planned breast CANCER surgeries, any radiation therapy, and any chemotherapy, whichever is last, >= 90 days but not >= 546 days prior to randomization\n\n  * Note: Reconstructive and prophylactic surgeries are allowed after randomization (during study treatment)\n* Patient had at least one of the following:\n\n  * Biopsy or surgery-proven regional node involvement by cancer\n  * T1c, T2, T3, or T4 disease (with inflammatory disease allowed) identified at the time of surgery or clinically identified prior to neoadjuvant chemotherapy\n  * No complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (those who did achieve complete response are still eligible if a pre-chemotherapy regional nodal biopsy identified cancer or if the pre-chemotherapy tumor measured > 1 cm)\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 0, 1\n* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >= 1500/mm^3 obtained =< 14 days prior to randomization\n* Platelet count >= 75,000/uL obtained =< 14 days prior to randomization\n* Aspartate transaminase (AST) =< 3 x upper limit of normal (ULN) obtained =< 14 days prior to randomization\n* Creatinine =< 1.5 x ULN obtained =< 14 days prior to randomization\n* Negative serum pregnancy test done =< 14 days prior to randomization, for women of childbearing potential only\n* Provide informed written consent\n* Willing to return to enrolling institution for follow-up\n* Willing to provide tissue and blood samples for correlative research studies\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be FEMALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Any of the following because this study involves an investigational agent whose genotoxic, mutagenic and teratogenic effects on the developing fetus and newborn are unknown:\n\n  * Pregnant women\n  * Nursing women\n  * Women of childbearing potential who are unwilling to employ adequate contraception\n* Clinical evidence of local recurrence or distant metastases; Note: New primary tumors are allowed, both contralaterally and ipsilaterally, but a prior breast cancer must have been more than 5 years beforehand\n* Known hypersensitivity reaction to GM-CSF\n* Active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment =< 30 days (i.e., with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive drugs) prior to randomization; Note: replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency) is not considered a form of systemic treatment; patients with vitiligo, Graves disease, or psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment within the past 30 days are not excluded; patients with Celiac disease controlled with diet modification are not excluded\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements\n\n  * NOTE: Localized fungal or viral infections including of the skin, nails, mouth, and genital area are allowed\n* History of other cancer < 5 years prior to consent (except non-melanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the uterine cervix) or current receipt of treatment another cancer (e.g., monoclonal antibody, small molecule pathway inhibitor)\n* Treatment with systemic corticosteroid or immune-modulators =< 7 days prior to randomization\n* Concurrent treatment with other experimental drugs or any other systemic anticancer therapy (due to unknown drug-vaccine potential interactions). Use of experimental or other targeted therapy > 3 months prior is allowed as long as it is not Her2-directed\n\n  * NOTE: Aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), statins, and other medications commonly used to treat nononcologic, non-autoimmune conditions are allowed\n* Immunocompromised patients and patients known to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive and currently receiving antiretroviral therapy\n* Prior or concurrent use of trastuzumab or other Her2-directed therapy\n* Prior or concurrent use of a PD-1 or PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor (including pembrolizumab) unless the use was >= 3 months prior to randomization",
