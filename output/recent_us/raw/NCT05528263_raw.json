    "inclusion_criteria": "* Patients post-prostatectomy with baseline Gleason >= 7 (per prostatectomy pathology)\n* Baseline PSA prior to start of androgen deprivation therapy nadir >= 0.2 ng/ml (post-operative value is never undetectable) obtained prior to step 1 registration\n* Baseline testosterone level obtained post-prostatectomy prior to start of androgen deprivation therapy and prior to step 1 registration\n* Pathologically (histologically) proven diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the prostate as confirmed at time of prostatectomy; prostatectomy must have been performed within 365 days (1 year) prior to step 1 registrationand any type of radical prostatectomy is permitted, including retropubic, perineal, laparoscopic or robotically assisted; (please note: Prior ablative treatment for benign prostatic hypertrophy or focal high-intensity focused ultrasound therapy [HIFU] prior to prostatectomy is allowed)\n* Surgical formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimen must be available for submission to GenomeDx for genomic analysis on DECIPHER GRID platform\n\n  * Please note: If a patient already has a Decipher risk score and meets all of the other eligibility criteria, the patient is eligible to be registered; however, the Decipher risk report will need to be submitted to GenomeDx for validation\n* Prior androgen deprivation (luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone [LHRH] agonist and/or non-steroidal anti-androgen) is allowed if:\n\n  * Androgen deprivation therapy was initiated within 30 days prior to study enrollment\n  * Androgen deprivation therapy was given for â‰¤ 90 days duration prior to radical prostatectomy\n  * Please note: Finasteride or dutasteride must be stopped before treatment but should not determine eligibility\n* Pathologically lymph node negative by pelvic lymphadenectomy (pN0) or lymph node status pathologically unknown (undissected pelvic lymph nodes [pNx])\n* Any pT-stage based on American Joint Committee on Cancer 7th edition eligible; study entry will be based on the following diagnostic workup:\n\n  * History/physical examination within 60 days prior to step 1 registration\n  * Negative distant metastatic workup:\n\n    * A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis (with contrast [CT without contrast is permitted if the patient is not a candidate for contrast, i.e., renal function or allergy]) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvis within 120 days prior to step 1 registration; (Please note: Lymph nodes will be considered negative (NO)if they are =< 1.5 cm short axis);\n    * Bone scan within 120 days prior to step 1 registration; (please note: a sodium fluoride [NaF] positron emission tomography [PET]/CT is an acceptable substitute and if the bone scan is suspicious, a plain x-ray, CT scan, NaF PET/CT and/or MRI must be obtained to rule out metastasis; Axumin scans are not allowed for determination of eligibility [e.g. a positive Axumin can in the setting of negative bonescan and CT does not exclude a patient from being eligible for enrollment]).\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of =< 1 within 60 days prior to step 1 registration\n* Platelets >= 100,000 cell/mm^3 (within 60 days prior to step 1 registration based upon a complete blood count [CBC])\n* Hemoglobin >= 10.0 g/dl (Note: The use of transfusion or other intervention to achieve hemoglobin [Hgb] >= 10.0 g/dl is NOT allowed) (within 60 days prior to step 1 registration based upon a CBC)\n* Absolute neutrophil count >= 1500 cells/mm^3 (within 60 days prior to step 1 registration based upon a CBC)\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) < 1.5 x the upper limit of normal (within 60 days prior to step 1 registration)\n* Total bilirubin (=< 1.5 mg/dl) normal unless history of Gilbert's syndrome (within 60 days prior to step 1 registration)\n* The patient or a legally authorized representative must provide study-specific informed consent prior to step 1 registration\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be MALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Definitive clinical or radiologic evidence of metastatic disease\n* Prior invasive malignancy (except non-melanomatous skin cancer or other in-situ malignancies, or stage Ta bladder cancer) unless disease free for a minimum of 2 years\n* Prior radiotherapy to the region of the study cancer that would result in overlap of radiation therapy fields\n* Prior systemic chemotherapy for the study cancer; note that prior chemotherapy for a different cancer is allowable if completed more than two years prior to step 1 registration; prior androgen deprivation is allowed\n* Prior whole gland ablative therapy (i.e. cryoablation or high intensity focused ultrasound [HIFU]) for prostate cancer is not allowed\n* Prostatectomy performed greater than 365 days (1 year) prior to step 1 registration\n* Severe and/or active co-morbidity defined as follows:\n\n  * History of inflammatory bowel disease\n  * History of active hepatitis B or C; blood tests are not required to determine if the patient has had hepatitis B or C, unless the patient reports a history of hepatitis\n  * Unstable angina and/or congestive heart failure requiring hospitalization within the last 6 months\n  * Transmural myocardial infarction within the last 6 months\n  * Acute bacterial or fungal infection requiring intravenous antibiotics at the time of step 1 registration\n  * Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation or other respiratory illness requiring hospitalization within 15 days of step 1 registration or precluding study therapy at the time of step 1 registration\n  * Uncontrolled severe illness or medical condition (including uncontrolled diabetes), which in the judgment of the treating physician would make the administration of chemotherapy inadvisable\n* Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive with cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) count < 200 cells/microliter; note that patients who are HIV positive are eligible, provided they are under treatment with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and have a CD4 count >= 200 cells/microliter within 30 days prior to step 1 registration; note also that HIV testing is not required for eligibility for this protocol",
