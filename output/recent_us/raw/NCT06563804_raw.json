    "official_title": "Pilot and Feasibility Study of Intravenous Magnesium in Patients Receiving Hyperthermic Intraoperative Chemotherapy With Cisplatin (HIOCC)",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Adults ≥18 years with malignant mesothelioma admitted for HIOCC. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of intravenous magnesium participants <18 years of age, children are excluded from this study, but will be eligible for future pediatric studies.\n* Glomerular filtration rate (GFR)≥ 30 ml/min/1.73m2 at the time of enrollment\n* Patients must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Patients with a pre-treatment serum Magnesium level >2.5 mg/dl or <1.3 mg/dl at the preoperative visit\n* Patients with AKI at the time of enrollment, assessed by Kidney Disease Improving Outcomes Criteria (serum creatinine increase ≥1.5x baseline)\n* Patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate <30 ml/min/1.73m2 at the time of enrollment\n* Patients with neuromuscular disease (e.g., amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, myasthenia gravis, myositis)\n* Patients with sustained bradycardia (heart rate <50 beats per minute on 1 or more EKGs in the preceding 90 days) or 2nd degree AV heart block type 2 or higher with the absence of a functioning pacemaker\n* Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to intravenous magnesium\n* Participants with uncontrolled intercurrent illness.\n* Participants with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because they may need magnesium for treatment of preeclampsia or eclampsia, apart from this study.",
