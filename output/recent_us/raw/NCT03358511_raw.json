    "exclusion_criteria": "* Any of the laboratory abnormalities as listed in the protocol.\n* Patient is pregnant or lactating female\n* Patient is a woman of childbearing potential as previously defined in inclusion #7, unless using effective contraception while on study treatment\n* Patient is a man who is a partner with of a woman of childbearing potential, unless they agree to use effective contraception while on study treatment as previously defined in inclusion #9.\n* Patient with prior history of encephalopathy, including Wernicke's Encephalopathy (WE)\n* Patient has signs or symptoms of encephalopathy, including Wernicke's Encephalopathy (e.g., severe ataxia, ocular paralysis or cerebellar signs) in which case thiamine deficiency needs to be excluded and a brain MRI might be required to exclude possible Wernicke's encephalopathy\n* Patient has thiamine deficiency if not corrected before enrollment on the study\n* Patient with concomitant treatment with or use of pharmaceutical or herbal agents known to be moderate or strong inducers of CYP3A4 or dual CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 inhibitors. For a list of moderate or strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4, see table 3-2 and 3-3 at https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-interactions-labeling/drug-development-and-drug-interactions-table-substrates-inhibitors-and-inducers.\n* Patient on any chemotherapy, immunomodulatory drug therapy (e.g., lenalidomide, pomalidomide, thalidomide, interferon-alpha), ruxolitinib, anagrelide, corticosteroids >10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent. Patients may remain on hydroxyurea (e.g., hydrea) if it is being employed to control leukocytosis as long as the patient has been on a stable dose for > 14 days prior to initiation of fedratinib.\n* Prior treatment with fedratinib\n* Patient on treatment with myeloid growth (e.g., G-CSF) factor within 14 days prior to initiation of fedratinib\n* Patient on treatment with aspirin with doses > 150 mg daily.\n* Patient with diagnosis of chronic liver disease (e.g., chronic alcoholic liver disease, autoimmune hepatitis, sclerosing cholangitis, primary biliary cirrhosis).\n* Patients with active (uncontrolled, metastatic) second malignancies are excluded.\n* Patient with uncontrolled congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association Classification 3 or 4).\n* Patient with known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), active infectious Hepatitis B (Hep B), and/or active Hepatitis C (Hep C).\n\n  a.

Patients with a history of Hep C infection are eligible if: i. Patient has completed curative antiviral treatment and has hepatitis C viral load below the limit of quantification ii. Pt has Hep C antibody positive but Hep C RNA negative due to prior treatment or natural resolution.\n* Patient with serious active infection requiring IV anti-microbials.\n* Patient with presence of any significant gastric or other disorder that would inhibit absorption of oral medication.\n* Patient is unable to swallow capsules.\n* Patient with participation in any study of an investigational agent (drug, biologic, device) within 30 days prior to start of fedratinib.\n* Patient has any condition including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which places the patient at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study.\n* Patient has any condition that confounds the ability to interpret data from the study.\n* Any major surgery or radiation therapy within four weeks.",
