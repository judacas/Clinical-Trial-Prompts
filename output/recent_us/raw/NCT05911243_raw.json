HLA typing may be performed for source identification.\n8. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.\n9. Adequate organ function.\n10. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at screening.\n11. All Subject must agree to practice a highly effective method of contraception.\n12. Women and men must agree not to donate eggs (ova, oocytes) or sperm, respectively, until at least 1 year after receiving a LB1901.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Histologically confirmed CD8+ TCL - CD8 positivity in tumor must be confirmed within 3 months prior to apheresis by IHC or flow cytometry.\n2. Prior treatment with cellular immunotherapy (e.g., CAR-T) or gene therapy product directed at any target.\n3. Prior treatment with CD4-targeted therapy.\n4. History of allogeneic haematopoietic stem cells transplant.\n5. Antitumor therapy prior to apheresis as follows:\n\n   * Any systemic anticancer therapy (chemotherapy, targeted therapy including ADC, epigenetic therapy including HDAC inhibitor, retinoids, pralatrexate, proteasome inhibitor therapy, investigational drug) within 21 days or at least 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter.\n   * Anti-CCR4 monoclonal antibody or any other monoclonal antibody within 4 weeks or at least 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter.\n   * Cytotoxic therapy within 14 days.\n   * Immunomodulatory agent therapy within 7 days.\n   * Radiotherapy within 14 days.\n6. Immunosuppressant (e.g., cyclosporine or systemic steroids) above physiologic dosing within 7 days of apheresis.\n7. Therapeutic anticoagulants (such as warfarin, heparin, low molecular weight heparin) (at least 3 half-lives must have elapsed after the last dose at the time of apheresis).\n8. CNS disease prophylaxis (e.g., intrathecal methotrexate) at least 7 days before apheresis.\n9. History or active Hepatitis B or C infection (except hepatitis C cured with pharmacotherapy); or history of or current HIV infection.\n10. History of autoimmune disease requiring systemic immunosuppression/systemic disease modifying agents within the last 2 years.\n11. Primary immunodeficiency.\n12. Active CNS disease related to the underlying malignancy.\n13. Stroke or seizure within 6 months of apheresis.\n14. Impaired cardiac function or clinically significant cardiac disease.\n15. Previous or concurrent malignancy with the following exceptions:\n\n    * Adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma.\n    * In situ carcinoma of the cervix or breast, treated curatively and without evidence of recurrence for at least 3 years prior to screening.\n    * A primary malignancy which has been completely resected, or treated, and is in complete remission for at least 3 years prior to screening.\n16. Serious and/or uncontrolled medical condition that, in the Investigator's judgment, would cause unacceptable safety risk.\n17. Ongoing toxicity from previous anticancer therapy that has not resolved to baseline levels or to Grade 1 or less, except for alopecia, fatigue, nausea, and constipation.\n18. Major surgery within 4 weeks prior to apheresis, or planned within 4 weeks after LB1901 administration.\n19. Contraindications or life-threatening allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to LB1901 or its excipients, including dimethyl sulfoxide; or to fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, or tocilizumab.\n20. Contraindication or life-threatening allergy to valacyclovir, unless another suitable option of antiviral prophylaxis is identified after consultation with an Infectious Disease specialist.\n21. Pregnant or breast-feeding.\n22. Plans to become pregnant or breastfeed, or father a child within 1 year after receiving a LB1901 infusion.",
