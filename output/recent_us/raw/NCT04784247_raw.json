This tumor tissue must meet the following criteria:\n\n    * Tissue must have been collected within 12 months prior to registration to the EAY191 Registration Trial\n    * Patient must not have had a Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) response (complete response [CR] or partial response [PR]) to any intervening therapy after collection of the tissue\n    * Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue block(s) or slides must be available OR\n  * Patients under 18 years old must confirm availability of an archival tumor tissue specimen for submission for research if patient enrolls to a ComboMATCH Treatment Trial. This tumor tissue must meet the following criteria:\n\n    * Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue block(s) or slides must be available\n  * NOTE: See specific ComboMATCH Treatment Trial protocol for tissue collection and management instructions. Performance of the mandatory research biopsy or submission of pre-trial formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) and collection and submission of the blood specimens for the integrated studies will be performed under the consent authority of the specific treatment trial protocol to which the patient is registered. No procedures to collect specimens for research only are to be performed for patients registered to the EAY191 Registration Trial only\n* NOTE: Each ComboMATCH Treatment Trial contains specific eligibility criteria. If patient is found to not be eligible for the assigned ComboMATCH Treatment Trial, indication of ineligibility will trigger re-evaluation and potential assignment to another Treatment Trial\nHealthy volunteers allowed",
