Small cell lung cancer (SCLC)\n5. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC; human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor negative)\n6. Pathologically confirmed HR+ (includes estrogen-receptor or progesterone-receptor) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative (HER2-) breast cancer (BrCa; must have progressed following treatment with a CDK4/6 inhibitor, and is not suitable for endocrine therapy)\n7. Other solid tumors with CCNE1 amplification\n\nDose Expansion:\n\nPart 2A: Pathologically confirmed HR+ and HER2- breast cancer which must have progressed following treatment with a CDK4/6 inhibitor, are not suitable for further endocrine therapy and have had no more than one line of prior systemic chemotherapy in the metastatic setting.\n\nPart 2B: Platinum resistant or refractory ovarian cancer (defined as recurrence ≤6 months after completing platinum-based regimen) with progression on at least one platinum containing therapy, with CCNE1 amplification as determined by NGS by local liquid or tissue test.\n\nPart 2C: Advanced unresectable or metastatic gastric, GEJ or esophageal adenocarcinoma with progression on at least one systemic therapy, with CCNE1 amplification as determined by NGS by local liquid or tissue test.\n\n* Have adequate organ function\n* Subjects with female reproductive organs must be surgically sterile, post-menopausal, or must be willing to use highly effective method(s) of contraception\n* Ability to swallow oral medications.\n* Subjects must consent to provide archived tumor tissues and paired tumor biopsy at pretreatment\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
