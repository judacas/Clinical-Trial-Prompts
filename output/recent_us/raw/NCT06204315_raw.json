    "official_title": "Screening Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain in Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer Managed With First/Second Line Chemotherapy or Inflammatory Breast Cancer Managed With Definitive Intent: A Prospective Study",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Participants must have histologically or cytologically confirmed breast cancer with pathologic assessment of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status. If subtype has changed over the course of a patient's disease, the treating clinician and/or study PI is responsible for selecting the subtype that most likely reflects the preponderance of oncologic disease at the time of enrollment.\n* Participants must have radiographic evidence of extracranial, distant metastases or unresectable, locally recurrent breast cancer and be initiating (within 8 weeks of registration) first-line or second-line chemotherapy for their metastatic/recurrent disease OR inflammatory breast cancer being managed with curative intent within six months of diagnosis.\n* Participants must be age 18 years or older.\n* Participants must have a life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks.\n* Participants must be willing to undergo study procedures.\n* The effects of gadolinium / other magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based contrast agents on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.\n* Participants must possess the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Participants who have a contraindication to MRI (e.g. noncompatible implanted metallic device for which MRI is absolutely contraindicated).\n* Participants who have chronic kidney disease stage IV-V or end stage renal disease.\n* Participants with a history of anaphylactic reactions to gadolinium.\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because gadolinium-based agents have not been proven to be safe to administer to a developing fetus. Similarly, breastfeeding women will be excluded from this study.\n* Patients with a prior diagnosis of brain metastases",
