    "official_title": "A Phase IB/II Study of Alectinib Combined With Cobimetinib in Advanced ALK-Rearranged (ALK+) NSCLC",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n* Age ≥ 18 years.\n* Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of metastatic NSCLC (Stage IV, AJCC v7.0) that carries an ALK rearrangement, as determined by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) test, using Vysis® ALK Break apart FISH Probe, or the Ventana® immunohistochemistry (IHC) test. Diagnosis using next generation sequencing (NGS) via a local diagnostic test will be accepted for enrollment but will need to be confirmed with either FISH or IHC.\n* For the expansion cohort: Patients must have had disease progression on alectinib (including patients who received alectinib as first-line treatment). Subsequent anti-neoplastic therapy (including other ALK inhibitors or chemotherapy) after progression on alectinib is not permitted. Note: patients in the dose-finding portion of the study may have received other anti-neoplastic therapy after progression on alectinib.\n* At least one measurable lesion as defined by RECIST version 1.1. Previously irradiated lesions are not measurable unless the lesion has demonstrated clear progression after radiation.\n* Eastern Cooperative Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 2 for patients treated in the expansion phase. ECOG PS ≤ 1 is required for participants in the dose-finding portion of the study.\n* Life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks\n* Patient willingness and disease accessible to pre-treatment, on-treatment tumor, and progression biopsies (core biopsies). A cell block from a pleural effusion may be substituted for a core biopsy.\n* Able to swallow and retain orally administered medication. Does not have any clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormalities, such as malabsorption syndrome or major resection of the stomach or small bowel that may alter absorption of the medication.\n* For participants in the dose-finding phase, a minimum washout period of at least 5 half-lives between the last dose of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy and the first dose of study treatment is required. For patients on crizotinib, a 7 day washout is sufficient. A shorter washout period may be considered in the event of disease flare, after discussion with the Sponsor. No washout is required if the most recent anti-neoplastic therapy is alectinib.\n* Patients must have recovered from treatment toxicities to ≤ Grade 1 or to their pretreatment levels except for adverse events (AEs) that in the investigator's judgment do not constitute a safety risk for the patient.\n* Patients can either be chemotherapy-naive or have received platinum-based chemotherapy for locally advanced or metastatic disease. Acute effects of therapy must have resolved to baseline severity or to CTCAE grade ≤1 except for AEs that in the investigator's judgment do not constitute a safety risk for the patient. Patients who have received prior treatment with checkpoint inhibitors are eligible.\n* Recovery from effects of any major surgery or significant traumatic injury at least 28 days before the first dose of study treatment\n* For all women of childbearing potential, a negative pregnancy test must be obtained at the baseline visit before starting study treatment. For women who are not postmenopausal (≥ 12 months of non-therapy-induced amenorrhea) or surgically sterile (absence of ovaries and/or uterus): agreement to remain abstinent or use two adequate methods of contraception, including at least one method with a failure rate of < 1% per year, during the treatment period and for at least 90 days after the last dose of study drug.\n\n  * Abstinence is only acceptable if it is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.\n  * Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of < 1% per year include tubal ligation, male sterilization, hormonal implants, established, proper use of combined oral or injected hormonal contraceptives, and certain intrauterine devices. Alternatively, two methods (e.g., two barrier methods such as a condom and a cervical cap) may be combined to achieve a failure rate of <1% per year. Barrier methods must always be supplemented with the use of a spermicide.\n* For men: agreement to remain abstinent or use a barrier method of contraception (e.g., condom) during the treatment period and for at least 90 days after the last dose of study drug and agreement to refrain from donating sperm during this same period\n\n  * Men with a pregnant partner must agree to remain abstinent or use a condom for the duration of the pregnancy.\n  * Abstinence is only acceptable if it is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.\n* Patients with untreated, controlled asymptomatic central nervous system (CNS) lesions are allowed in this trial as long as the CNS is not a site of progressive disease on alectinib monotherapy. If the CNS is a site of progressive disease on alectinib monotherapy, treatment of CNS lesions is required for enrollment.\n* The use of seizure prophylaxis is allowed as long as patients are taking non-enzyme inducing anti-epileptic drugs (non-EIAED). If patients were previously on EIAEDs and these have been discontinued, they must have been discontinued for at least 2 weeks prior to treatment start. If patients require an anti-epileptic medication, then a CYP3A4 non-EIAED can be used such as levetiracetam, valproic acid, gabapentin, topiramate or lacosamide.\n* Patients requiring steroids must be at a stable or decreasing dose for at least 1 week prior to enrollment\n* Patients with asymptomatic leptomeningeal disease are eligible for participation in this trial. However, patients who had progression of leptomeningeal disease on alectinib will be required to undergo CNS radiation to meet eligibility.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Participants who have had chemotherapy within 3 weeks prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 3 weeks earlier.\n* Participants who experienced progression of CNS lesions on alectinib who have not received local CNS therapies (radiation, surgery) to address the lesions. CNS imaging obtained at least 21 days after completion of radiation is required for confirmation of response.\n* Radiation therapy (except palliative to relieve bone pain) within 7 days of study entry. Palliative radiation (≤ 10 fractions) must have been completed at least 48 hours prior to study entry. Stereotactic or small field brain irradiation must have been completed at least 7 days prior to study entry. Whole brain radiation and radiation for leptomeningeal metastasis must have been completed at least 2 weeks prior to study entry. Acute effects of radiation must have resolved to baseline severity or to CTCAE grade ≤1 except for AEs that in the investigator's judgment do not constitute a safety risk for the patient.\n* Participants with uncontrolled tumor-related pain.\n\n  * Symptomatic lesions amenable to palliative radiotherapy (e.g., bone metastases or metastases causing nerve impingement) should be treated prior to enrollment.\n  * Asymptomatic metastatic lesions whose further growth would likely cause functional deficits or intractable pain (e.g., epidural metastases that are not currently associated with spinal cord compression) should be considered for loco-regional therapy if appropriate prior to enrollment.\n* Patients who are receiving denosumab prior to enrollment who are not willing and/or eligible to switch to a bisphosphonate while on study.\n* Pregnant or lactating women.\n* History of hypersensitivity to alectinib or any of its excipients.
