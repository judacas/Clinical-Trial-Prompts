    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Men and women ≥ 18 years of age.\n2. Patients must have histologic confirmation of Follicular Lymphoma (FL) (grade 1, 2 and 3A). Note: Participants who have received previous CD19-directed therapy must have a biopsy which shows CD19 expression after completion of the CD19-directed therapy.\n3. Patients with relapsed or refractory FL previously treated with ≥1 line of systemic therapy having ≥ 1 Groupe d'Etude des Lymphomes (GELF) criteria for therapy, or Progression of Diseases within 24 months (POD24), or second relapse.\n4. Baseline FDG-PET/CT scans must demonstrate positive lesions compatible with CT defined anatomical tumor sites. Patients should have at least one measurable site of disease per Lugano classification.\n5. Patient should have ≥ 1 Groupe d'Etude des Lymphomes (GELF) criteria for treatment initiation).\n\n   * Involvement of ≥3 nodal sites, each with diameter of ≥3 cm\n   * Any nodal or extranodal tumor mass with a diameter of ≥7 cm\n   * B symptoms (fever ≥ 38 degrees Celsius of unclear etiology, night sweats, weight loss > 10% within the prior 6 months).\n   * Risk of local compressive symptoms that may result in organ compromise\n   * Splenomegaly or splenic lesion without splenomegaly\n   * Leukopenia (leukocytes < 1000/mm3)\n   * Leukemia (> 5.000 lymphoma cells/mm3)\n   * Bone lesions detected on FDG-PET/CT; or\n6. Progression or relapse within 24 months of frontline treatment in patients previously treated with ≥1 line of systemic therapy; or\n7. Second FL relapse/progression after ≥1 line of systemic therapy. These patients will be eligible independently of GELF criteria and POD24.\n8. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 2.\n9. Life expectancy of greater than 6 weeks.\n10. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below,\n\n    * Absolute neutrophil count ≥1000/mm3 (unless due to lymphoma involvement of the bone marrow or spleen).\n    * Platelets ≥100,000/mm3 or ≥ 60,000/mm3 in case of bone marrow involvement by lymphoma.\n    * Hemoglobin ≥ 10 g/dL or ≥8 g/dL in case of bone marrow involvement by lymphoma.\n    * Total bilirubin < 1.5 x within normal institutional limits (unless due to lymphoma involvement of liver or a known history of Gilbert's disease).\n    * Gamma-Glutamyl Transpeptidase (GGT)/Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST)/(SGOT)/Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT)(SGPT) ≤ 2.5 × institutional upper limit of normal.\n    * Creatinine within normal institutional limits, or creatinine clearance ≥30 ml/min/1.7m^2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal (unless due to lymphoma).\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. FL grade 3B or transformed FL.\n2. [Removed]\n3. ≥ 6 lines of systemic immunochemotherapy for treatment of FL.\n4. Patients with clinically significant pleural effusions and/or ascites requiring drainage or associated with shortness of breath.\n5. Patients receiving any other investigational agents.\n6. Patients with known central nervous system involvement of lymphoma.\n7. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness such as: history of Myocardial Infarction (MI) in the last 6 months, congestive heart failure New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III-IV, uncontrolled or symptomatic arrhythmia, stroke in last 6 months, liver cirrhosis, and autoimmune disorder requiring immunosuppression or long-term corticosteroids (>10 mg daily prednisone equivalent).\n8. Breastfeeding or pregnant women.\n9. Serologic status reflecting active hepatitis B or C infection. Patients that are positive for hepatitis B core antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), or hepatitis C antibody will need a negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) prior to enrollment. (PCR positive patients will be excluded.) Hepatitis C antibody positive patients are eligible if PCR is negative. Hepatitis B core antibody (+) patients without evidence of HBsAg or Hep B PCR (+) are eligible with appropriate Hepatitis B reactivation prophylaxis.\n10. History of Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Note: HIV screening test is optional\n11. Patients with impaired decision-making capacity.",
