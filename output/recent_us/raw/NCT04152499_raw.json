Skin lesions can be used if the area is >= 2cm in at least one diameter and measured with a ruler\n  * Bone marrow plasma cells >= 30%\n  * Patients with IgA myeloma in whom serum protein electrophoresis is deemed unreliable, due to co-migration of normal serum proteins with the para protein in the beta region, may be considered eligible as long as total serum IgA level is elevated above normal range\n* Prior treatment:\n\n  * Arm A: At least one of the following must be true: (1) Subjects must have been previously treated with at least 3 prior lines of therapy, including a proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulatory drug (IMiD) (2) Subjects who are refractory to carfilzomib and/or pomalidomide may enroll in Arm A using the quadruplet regimen, SKPd, provided carfilzomib, pomalidomide and dexamethasone (KPd) triplet is not the most recent line of prior therapy and that they have been previously treated with at least 3 prior lines of therapy, including a proteasome inhibitor and an IMiD. Carfilzomib/Pomalidomide refractory status is defined by the IMWG criteria: disease that is nonresponsive (stable disease [SD] or progressive disease [PD]) while on therapy, or progresses within 60 days of last therapy in patients who have achieved minimal response (MR) or better at some point previously before then progressing in their disease course.\n  * Arm B: Subjects must have progressive disease and been exposed to up to 2 prior lines of therapy, including a proteasome inhibitor and lenalidomide\n* Provide written informed consent\n* Willing to return to enrolling institution for follow-up (during the active monitoring phase of the study) and ability to adhere with the study visit schedule and other protocol procedures\n* Willingness to provide mandatory tissue specimens for correlative research\n* Willingness to use fixed-duration therapy (up to 18 cycles) for relapsed refractory multiple myeloma\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 0, 1 or 2\n* Ability to complete questionnaire(s) by themselves or with assistance\n* Willingness to provide mandatory blood specimens for correlative research\n* Calculated creatinine clearance (using Cockcroft-Gault equation) >= 15 mL/min (obtained =< 14 days prior to registration)\n* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >= 1500/uL(without growth factor support for >= 7 days ( obtained =< 14 days prior to registration)\n* Un-transfused Platelet count >= 100,000/uL (without platelet transfusion for >= 14 days) for SKPd and >= 100,000 (without platelet transfusion for >= 7 days) for SPd is permitted.

Female subjects of child bearing potential are those who 1) have achieved menarche at some point, 2) have not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or 3) have not been naturally postmenopausal (amenorrhea following cancer therapy does not rule out childbearing potential) for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months). Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and preferred contraception for the subject. Male subjects must agree to practice abstinence or use an effective barrier method of contraception starting with the first dose of carfilzomib or pomalidomide through 6 months after last dose of pomalidomide and carfilzomib if sexually active with a female of childbearing potential. Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and preferred contraception for the subject. Other acceptable methods of contraception are condoms with contraceptive foam, oral, implantable or injectable contraceptives, contraceptive patch, intrauterine device, diaphragm with spermicidal gel, or a sexual partner who is surgically sterilized or post-menopausal. All subjects must agree to follow the local requirements for pomalidomide counseling, pregnancy testing, and birth control; and be willing and able to comply with the local requirements (for example, periodic pregnancy tests, safety labs, etc.)\n* Willingness to follow the requirements of the Pomalyst Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program\n* Able to swallow capsules and able to take and tolerate oral medications on a continuous basis\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
