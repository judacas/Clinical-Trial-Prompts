    "exclusion_criteria": "* Treatment with systemic anticancer therapy within 4 weeks of the first dose of study drug (6 weeks if therapy was mitomycin C and/or nitrosoureas), or within 5 half-lives of the agent if half-life is known and it is shorter, before first dose of study drug. Anticancer therapies include cytotoxic chemotherapy, targeted inhibitors, and immunotherapies, but do not include hormonal therapy or radiotherapy.\n* Radiation therapy within 2 weeks before 1st dose of study drug or unresolved toxicity from previous radiotherapy.\n* History of any other malignancy known to be active, with the exception of completely removed in situ cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia, non-melanoma skin cancer, DCIS, early stage prostate cancer that has been adequately treated, and other cancers from which the patient has been disease free for 3 years or longer.\n* Currently participating in a study and receiving study therapy, or participated in a study of an investigational agent and received study therapy or used an investigational device within 4 weeks of the first dose of study treatment.",
