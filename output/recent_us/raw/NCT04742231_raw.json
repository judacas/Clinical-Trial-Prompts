    "official_title": "A Phase 1b Multicentre, Open-label, Modular, Dose-finding and Dose-expansion Study to Explore the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Anti-tumour Activity of Trastuzumab Deruxtecan (T-DXd) in Combination With Other Anti-cancer Agents in Patients With Metastatic HER2-low Breast Cancer (DESTINY-Breast08)",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Patients must be at least 18 years of age\n* Male or female patients who have pathologically documented breast cancer that:\n\n  1. Has a history of HER2-low expression, defined as IHC 2+/ISH- or IHC 1+ (ISH- or untested) with a validated assay\n  2. Is documented as HR+ (either ER and/or PgR positive [ER or PgR â‰¥1%]) or ER and PgR negative (ER and PgR <1%) per ASCO/CAP guidelines in the metastatic setting\n* Patient must have adequate tumor sample for biomarker assessment\n* ECOG Performance Status of 0 or 1\n\nFor patients with HR+ disease:\n\nPart 1: At least 1 prior treatment line of ET with or without a targeted therapy (such as CDK4/6, mTOR or PI3-K inhibitors), and at least 1 prior line of chemotherapy for MBC are required.\n\nPart 2: Only 1 prior treatment line of ET with or without a targeted therapy (such as CDK4/6, mTOR or PI3-K inhibitors) for MBC is allowed. No prior chemotherapy in the metastatic setting is allowed. Note there are no patients with HR+ disease in Part 2 of Modules 2 and 3.\n\nFor patients with HR- disease:\n\nPart 1: At least 1 prior line of chemotherapy for MBC is required. Note there are no patients with HR- disease in Part 1 of Modules 4 and 5.\n\nPart 2: For Module 2, no prior lines of therapy for MBC are allowed, and for Modules 1 and 3, only 1 prior line of chemotherapy for MBC is allowed. Note there are no patients with HR- disease in Part 2 of Modules 4 and 5.\n\nKey\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness\n* Uncontrolled or siginificant cardiovascular disease\n* History of (non-infectious) ILD/pneumonitis that required steroids, has current ILD/pneumonitis, or where suspected ILD/pneumonitis cannot be ruled out by imaging at screening.\n* Lung-specific intercurrent clinically significant illnesses\n* Has spinal cord compression or clinically active central nervous system metastases\n* Active primary immunodeficiency\n* Uncontrolled infection requiring IV antibiotics, antivirals, or antifungals\n* Prior treatment with ADC that comprises of an exatecan derivative that is a topoisomerase I inhibitor.",
