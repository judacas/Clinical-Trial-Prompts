Note: fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) avid disease by positron emission tomography (PET) recommended, if possible.\n* Cohort C (TMF cohort): measurable by the Olsen Criteria (Olsen, 2011) including at least 1 cutaneous lymphoma lesion ≥2 cm in diameter, assessed locally for eligibility.\n* Patients must have relapsed or refractory disease AND the following:\n* Cohorts A and B (PTCL): patients must have received at least 1 prior line of systemic therapy. For patients with systemic ALCL, patients must have failed or be intolerant to brentuximab vedotin [BV]; Adcetris®\n* Cohort C (TMF): patients must have received at least 1 prior line of systemic therapy; and have exhausted systemic therapies with regular approval for their disease\n\nMain\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",

Note: Patients who have had a transplant >3 years ago are eligible as long as there are no signs/symptoms of graft versus host disease (GvHD).\n* Requirement for systemic immunosuppressive therapy, e.g. GvHD therapy, <12 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug.\n* Prior treatment with AFM13",
