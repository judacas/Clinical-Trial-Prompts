    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Participants with unresectable advanced or metastatic disease or 1L or 2L+ clear cell Renal cell carcinoma.\n2. Have not received HIF-2α targeted therapy previously.\n3. Measurable disease according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1; Eisenhauer et al, 2009) as determined by the Investigator.\n4. For all participants, archival tumor tissue material should be obtained; if archival tissue is not available or is older than 2 years, then a fresh biopsy should be obtained, if medically feasible. Specific requirements for tumor tissue samples will be described in the Laboratory Manual.\n5. Recovery to baseline or ≤ Grade 1 per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5 from AE(s) related to any prior treatments unless AE(s) are deemed clinically nonsignificant by the Investigator and/or stable on supportive therapy.\n6. Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) ≥70%.\n7. Screening ambulatory oxygen saturation (SpO2) ≥92%.\n8. Screening left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) above the institutional lower limit of normal.\n\nKey\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Participants who have been previously treated with a HIF-2α targeted therapy and/or zanzalintinib.\n2. Radiation therapy for bone metastases within 2 weeks, any other radiation therapy within 4 weeks before first dose of study treatment. Participants with clinically-relevant ongoing complications from prior radiation therapy are not eligible.\n3. Known brain metastases or cranial epidural disease unless adequately treated with radiotherapy and/or surgery (including radiosurgery) and stable for at least 4 weeks before first dose of study treatment.\n4. Concomitant anticoagulation with oral anticoagulants except for 1) prophylactic use of low-dose aspirin for cardioprotection or low dose low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) or 2) therapeutic doses of LMWH or specified direct factor Xa inhibitors.\n5. Administration of a live, attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to enrollment.\n\nNote: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.",
