    "inclusion_criteria": "* Patients with AML who have undergone AML cell harvest and cryopreservation as per protocol 16-593 or companion protocol 18-232.\n* Patients must have had a minimum of 5x107 cells cryopreserved.\n* Patients must be day 25-45 following allogeneic transplantation from either:\n\n  * Group A: HLA 8/8 or 7/8 matched related donor or HLA 8/8 matched unrelated donor, as determined by antigen or allele level typing at HLA A,B,C, and HLA DRB1.\n\nOR\n\n* Group B: Haplo-identical donor\n\n  * Patients must be ≥ 18 years old\n  * ECOG performance status ≤2 (Appendix A)\n  * Participants must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:\n* Total bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dL (unless patient has Gilbert's disease)\n* AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤ 3 × institutional upper limit of normal\n* Creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dl\n* Absolute neutrophil count > 1000\n* Platelet count > 50,000\n\n  * The effects of DC/AML fusion cells on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.\n  * No evidence of ongoing grade 2 or higher aGVHD\n  * Must be on prednisone <20mg or other steroid equivalent\n  * Donor chimerism of bone marrow >60%\n  * Resolution of all transplant related grade III-IV toxicity as per CTC criteria 4.0\n  * Complete remission defined by absence of circulating blasts and less than 5% blasts in the bone marrow\n  * Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n\nEligibility Prior to Initiating Vaccination (Groups A and B)\n\n* Assessments to be done between Day 45-75 post-transplant.\n* At least 2 doses of fusion vaccine were produced\n* No ongoing grade II-IV acute GVHD\n* Prednisone requirement of < 20mg a day or steroid equivalent\n* Participants must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:\n\n  * Total bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dL (unless patient has Gilbert's disease)\n  * AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤ 3 × institutional upper limit of normal\n  * Creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dl\n  * Absolute neutrophil count > 1000\n  * Platelet count > 50,000\n* No uncontrolled acute infection\n* No CTCAE grade ≥ 3 non-hematologic toxicity\n* No serious intercurrent illness such as active acute infection, or significant cardiac disease characterized by clinically significant arrhythmia, active ischemic coronary disease or symptomatic congestive heart failure.\n* Participants must be in a complete remission\n\nPre-Treatment Criteria Prior to Decitabine (Group A Cohort 2)\n\n* Assessments to be done within 3 days prior to initiation of therapy.\n* Participants must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:\n* Total bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dL (unless patient has Gilbert's disease)\n\n  * AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤ 3 × institutional upper limit of normal\n  * Creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dl\n  * Absolute neutrophil count > 1000\n  * Platelet count > 50,000\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Because of compromised cellular immunity, patients with a known history of HIV are excluded\n* Leukemia with active CNS involvement\n* Patients must not be pregnant. All premenopausal patients will undergo pregnancy testing. Men will agree to not father a child while on protocol treatment. Men and women will practice effective birth control while receiving protocol treatment.\n* Participants may not be receiving any other Non-FDA approved study agents at the start of vaccination\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including uncontrolled active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* Autoimmune or inflammatory disorders requiring active treatment with systemic steroids or immunosuppressive therapy limited to the following:\n\n  * GI Disorders: (including inflammatory bowel disease [e.g., ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease]\n  * Systemic lupus erythematosus\n  * Wegener's syndrome [granulomatosis with polyangiitis]\n  * Myasthenia gravis\n  * Graves' disease\n  * Rheumatoid arthritis\n  * Hypophysitis\n  * Uveitis",
