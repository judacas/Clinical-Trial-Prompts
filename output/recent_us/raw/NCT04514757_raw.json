    "exclusion_criteria": "Participants may not meet any of the following exclusion criteria to be eligible for study entry:\n\n1. Prior treatment for High Grade Glioma (HGG).\n2. History of other malignancy unless the participant has been disease-free for at least 5 years. Adequately treated basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell skin cancer is not exclusionary regardless of time, as well as localized prostate carcinoma or cervical carcinoma in situ after curative treatment.\n3. Histological confirmed oligodendroglioma (IDH-mutant and 1p.19q-codeleted) or mixed glioma.\n4. A contrast-enhancing brain tumor that is any of the following:\n\n   1.
