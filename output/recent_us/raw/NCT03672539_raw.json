FCBP must also agree to ongoing pregnancy testing. Men must agree to use a latex condom during sexual contact with a FCBP even if they have had a vasectomy. All subjects must be counseled at a minimum of every 28 days about pregnancy precautions and risks of fetal exposure.\n\n  † A FCBP (female of childbearing potential) is a sexually mature woman who: 1) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 2) has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months)\n\n  13.

Any serious medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric illness that would prevent the subject from signing the informed consent form\n  8. Any condition, including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which places the subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study or confounds the ability to interpret data from the study\n  9. Undergone major surgery within 28 days prior enrollment or has not recovered from side effects of such therapy (vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty is not considered to be a major surgery; however, the investigator is to discuss enrollment of a subject with a recent history of kyphoplasty with the medical monitor).\n  10.

Received the following prior therapy:\n\n      * Chemotherapy within 3 weeks of study drugs\n      * Corticosteroids (>20 mg/daily prednisone or equivalent) within 3 weeks of study drugs to ensure that steroid dose intensity at the beginning of the treatment is not altered by administration of steroids prior to the study. Consumption of steroids within 3 weeks of the treatment may interfere with efficacy and side effects due to differences of steroid intensity.\n      * Immunotherapy or antibody therapy as well as thalidomide, arsenic trioxide, or bortezomib within 21 days before study drugs\n      * Lenalidomide within 7 days before study drugs\n      * Lenalidomide within 21 days before study drugs (Part 4 only)\n      * Extensive radiation therapy within 28 days before study drugs. Receipt of localized radiation therapy does not preclude enrollment.\n      * Use of any other experimental drug or therapy within 28 days of study drugs\n      * Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, strong CYP3A4 inducers and fluconazole doses >200 mg daily within 5 half-lives before study drugs. (For example, clarithromycin has half-life of 4 hours so washout period for clarithromycin is 20 hours.)\n  12. Known hypersensitivity to compounds of similar chemical or biological composition to thalidomide and lenalidomide or steroids.\n  13. Concurrent use of other anti-cancer agents or treatments\n  14.
