    "exclusion_criteria": "* Prior exposure to a combination of IRX-2 regimen, PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors and CTLA-4 inhibitors are excluded. Prior exposure to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors is allowed.\n* Radiation therapy with a curable intent within 30 days of first dose of study treatment is excluded. However, radiation therapy with a palliative intent is allowed to treat after 14 days from the last dose of radiation.\n* Any medical contraindications or previous therapy that would preclude treatment with the IRX-2 Regimen, or nivolumab.\n* Any unresolved toxicity Grade 2 or greater from previous anticancer therapy with the exception of alopecia, vitiligo, and the laboratory values defined in the inclusion criteria.\n* Participants with irreversible toxicity not reasonably expected to be exacerbated by treatment with IRX-2, or nivolumab may be included only after consultation with the study physician.\n* Active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders\n* Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 14 days before the first dose of study treatment. Some exceptions apply.\n* Major surgical procedure (as defined by the Investigator) within 28 days prior to the first dose of study treatment. Note: Local surgery of isolated lesions for palliative intent is acceptable.\n* History of allogenic organ transplantation.\n* Symptomatic cardiopulmonary disease, coronary artery disease, serious arrhythmia or chronic lung disease. Participants with these conditions who are stable with relatively minor symptoms and who are appropriate candidates for systemic treatments need not be excluded.\n* Myocardial infarction within the last 3 months.\n* Known infection with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or HIV.\n* Signs or symptoms of systemic infection (use of antibiotics to treat superficial infection or contamination of tumor shall not, by itself, be considered evidence of infection).\n* Clinically significant gastritis or peptic ulcer disease\n* Stroke or other symptoms of cerebral vascular insufficiency within the last 3 months.\n* Allergy to ciprofloxacin (or other quinolones).\n* Previous diagnosis of invasive cancer from which the individual is not disease-free AND that has required treatment within the past 3 years, except for superficial skin, cervical cancer in-situ, or early stage prostate or bladder cancer (i.e. treatment with curative intent and long term disease-free expectations).\n* History of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis\n* Known allergy or hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs or any of the study drug excipients.\n* Female participants who are pregnant or breastfeeding or male or female participants of reproductive potential who are not willing to employ effective birth control from screening to 1 year after the last dose of study treatment.",
