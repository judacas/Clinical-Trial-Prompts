    "inclusion_criteria": "* Patients must have a diagnosis of a metastatic solid tumor or a hematologic malignancy and must receive anti-cancer treatment (i.e. chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, targeted therapy, biologic therapy, immune therapy, bone marrow transplant). Registration must occur within 180 days after diagnosis of metastatic or stage IV solid tumor or treatment-requiring hematologic malignancy. Patients with indolent hematologic diseases undergoing observation alone are not eligible; patients with previously diagnosed hematologic cancers progressed to the point of requiring systemic therapy are eligible, so long as the progression occurred within the previous 180 days. Biopsy confirmation of metastatic disease is not required\n* Patients with recurrent solid tumors will be allowed as long as 1) this is the first presentation of metastatic disease and 2) the diagnosis of the metastasis is at least 180 days (6 months) after the diagnosis date of the previous earlier stage cancer\n* Patients with a history of secondary malignancy are allowed as long as they were not diagnosed within the previous 24 months, are not on active therapy, and are disease-free. Patients with adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, and in situ cervical cancer at any point prior to enrollment are eligible\n* Patients who have started anti-cancer treatment for the current diagnosis must have started within 90 days prior to registration\n* Patients who are planning to start anti-cancer treatment for the current diagnosis must start within (=<) 30 days after registration\n* Patients are allowed to be co-enrolled on other clinical trials (including non-treatment studies and studies that may or may not include investigational drugs)\n* Patients must be at least 18 years of age\n* Patients must have a Zubrod performance status of 0-2\n* Patients must complete the baseline patient reported outcomes (PRO) questionnaires prior to registration and must be able to complete questionnaires in English or Spanish\n* Patients must provide their full name, primary address in the United States (U.S.), birth date and social security number at registration for the purposes of accessing credit report data.
