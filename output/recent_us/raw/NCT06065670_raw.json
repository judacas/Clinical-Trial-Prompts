    "inclusion_criteria": "* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ≤ 2\n* Histologically confirmed diagnosis of iNHL (subtypes include follicular lymphoma [FL] Grades 1 to 3a), marginal zone lymphoma (splenic, nodal, or extranodal), or small lymphocytic lymphoma\n* Must have received 1 prior systemic regimen for iNHL\n* Must have documented radiologic evidence of disease progression, at least 1 bi-dimensionally measurable lesion ≥ 1.5 centimeters (which has not been previously irradiated), according to 2007 revised International Working Group criteria, and be a candidate for a subsequent line of therapy.\n* Must have adequate organ function defined by the following laboratory parameters:\n\n  * Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.0 × 10^9/liter (L)\n  * Platelet count ≥ 75 × 10^9/L\n  * Hemoglobin ≥ 8 grams/deciliter\n  * Estimated creatinine clearance ≥ 60 milliliters/minute, as determined by the Cockcroft-Gault method\n  * Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) (exception: participants with Gilbert's Syndrome may have a bilirubin > 1.5 × ULN)\n  * Aspartate transaminase/serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase and alanine aminotransferase/serum pyruvic transaminase ≤ 3.0 × ULN\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Anticancer treatment, major surgery, or use of any investigational drug within 28 days before the start of study intervention; palliative radiation therapy is allowed if > 7 days before planned first dose of study interventions, and any toxicity is Grade ≤ 1\n* Clinical or histological evidence of transformation to a more aggressive subtype of lymphoma or grade 3b FL or Richters' transformation or chronic lymphocytic leukemia\n* Prior allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant; prior treatment with a PI3K inhibitor\n* History of drug-induced colitis or pneumonitis; tuberculosis treatment ≤ 2 years prior to randomization; administration of a live or live attenuated vaccine within 6 weeks of randomization\n* Ongoing treatment with chronic immunosuppressants or systemic steroids or treatment for systemic bacterial, fungal, or viral infection\n* Active cytomegalovirus or Epstein-Barr virus infection\n* Unable to receive prophylactic treatment for pneumocystis, herpes simplex virus, or herpes zoster at screening\n* Concurrent administration of medications or foods that are strong inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome P450 3A. No prior use within 2 weeks before the start of study intervention.\n* Baseline QT interval corrected with Fridericia's method > 500 milliseconds\n* Concurrent active malignancy other than non-melanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix, bladder cancer, or prostate cancer not requiring treatment. Participants with previous malignancies are eligible if they have been disease-free for 2 years or more.\n* Unstable or severe uncontrolled medical condition that would, in the Investigator's judgment, increase the participant's risk to participating in this study.",
