Periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of birth control.\n* Sexually active participants must agree to use medically accepted methods of contraception (i.e. barrier methods including condoms, female condom, or diaphragm with spermicidal gel) during the study and for 4 months after the last dose of the study treatment.

    "exclusion_criteria": "* Prior treatment with abemaciclib or cabozantinib.\n* Receipt of any type of anti-cancer antibody, cytotoxic anticancer therapy, or any other investigational agents within 2 weeks of treatment start or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter. For immune checkpoint inhibitors, patients must have discontinued treatment 28 days prior to trial enrollment.\n* Symptomatic brain metastasis or leptomeningeal disease requiring steroid use. Patients are eligible if they are neurologically stable for 4 weeks, have completed radiation therapy or surgery, and recovered from side effects.

Allowed anticoagulants are the following:\n\n  * Prophylactic use of low-dose aspirin for cardio-protection (per local applicable guidelines) and low-dose low molecular weight heparins (LMWH).\n  * Therapeutic doses of LMWH or anticoagulation with direct factor Xa inhibitors rivaroxaban, edoxaban, or apixaban in subjects without known brain metastases who are on a stable dose of the anticoagulant for at least 1 week before first dose of study treatment without clinically significant hemorrhagic complications from the anticoagulation regimen or the tumor.\n* Clinically significant hematuria, hematemesis, or hemoptysis of > 0.5 teaspoon (2.5 ml) of red blood, or other history of significant bleeding (eg, pulmonary hemorrhage) within 12 weeks before first dose.
