    "inclusion_criteria": "1.0 INCLUSION CRITERIA\n\n1.1. All participants must have a diagnosis of NF1 based on the 2021 revised consensus criteria.\n\n1.2. Participants must have PN(s) that are progressive OR are causing significant morbidity, such as (but not limited to) head and neck lesions that are compromising the airway or great vessels, brachial or lumbar plexus lesions that are causing nerve compression and loss of function, lesions causing significant disfigurement (e.g., orbital lesions), lesions of the extremity that cause limb hypertrophy or loss of function, and painful lesions. Participants with paraspinal PN will be eligible for this trial. Histologic confirmation of tumor is not necessary but should be considered if there are clinical or radiographic findings concerning for malignant transformation of a PN.\n\n1.2.1. For participants enrolled for tumor progression, progression is defined as: Presence of new PN on MRI or CT (documented by comparison with prior MRI or CT), OR A measurable increase in PN size (≥ 20% increase in the volume, or a ≥ 13% increase in the product of the two longest perpendicular diameters, or a ≥ 6% increase in the longest diameter) documented by comparison of two scans (MRI or CT) in the time period of 18 months or less prior to evaluation for this study.\n\n1.2.2. For participants enrolled for tumors causing \"significant disfigurement\" without meeting another criterion (i.e., not progressive or causing other significant morbidity), eligible tumors will be limited to tumors of the head & neck or those on other areas of the body that are unable to be concealed by standard garments. In order to enroll a participant with PN for these indications, photographs must be reviewed by a Study Chair and/or Co-Chair for decision regarding participant eligibility prior to enrollment.\n\n1.3. Disease status: Measurable disease: Participants must have measurable PN(s) amenable to volumetric MRI analysis. For the purpose of this study, the target lesion must be seen on at least 3 consecutive MRI slices and the field of view must contain the entire tumor of interest. Tumors must be at least 3 mL in volume (most PN 3 cm in longest diameter will meet this criteria). If the tumor is <3 cm in longest diameter, the participant may still be eligible. Central review of the MRI of the target PN is required prior to enrollment to ensure that the tumor is measurable and amenable to volumetric analysis.\n\n1.4. Age: Participants must be ≥16 years of age at the time of study entry.\n\n1.5. Performance Level: Participants must have Karnofsky ³ 50%. Note: Participants who are unable to walk because of paralysis, but who are up in a wheelchair, will be considered ambulatory for assessing the performance score.\n\n1.6. Body Surface Area (BSA): Participants must have a BSA of 1.0 m2 or greater.\n\n1.7. Organ Function Requirements:\n\n1.7.1. Adequate Bone Marrow Function Defined as: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1500/µL without granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support.\n\nWhite blood cell count ≥ 2500/µL Platelet count ³ 100,000/mL without transfusion Hemoglobin ³10.0 gm/dL (>5 days between enrollment and last RBC transfusion)\n\n1.7.2.

Adequate Liver Function Defined as: Total bilirubin (sum of conjugated + unconjugated) £ 1.5x upper limit of normal (ULN) for age (for participants with Gilbert's disease ≤3x ULN), and Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) < 2.5x the upper limit of normal (ULN).\n\nSerum albumin ³ 2.8 g/dL. PT/INR and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) test < 1.3x the laboratory ULN\n\n1.7.4.

CPK level within normal limits within 14 days from the start of treatment.\n\n1.7.6. Normal pancreatic function: amylase and lipase levels ≤ 1.5 x ULN\n\n1.7.7. Blood pressure within upper limit of normal as defined below. Antihypertensives are permissible to achieve blood pressure within ULN, however must be on stable antihypertensive regimen with no adjustments within 30 days of enrollment.\n\nIn adolescents, a blood pressure (BP) ≤ 90th percentile for age, height, and sex.\n\nIn adults (³18 years of age), a systolic blood pressure ≤130 mmHg and a diastolic pressure of ≤80 mmHg.\n\n1.8.

Sexually active fertile participants and their partners must agree to use effective methods of contraception e.g., hormonal oral contraception, injectables, intrauterine device, surgical sterilization including vasectomy, or hormonal implant with barrier methods (male condom, female condom, or diaphragm with spermicidal gel) during the course of the study and for 4 months after the last dose of study treatment. Barrier methods alone are insufficient. True sexual abstinence is an acceptable method of birth control for both men and women. Persons of childbearing potential will be given a pregnancy test within 7 days prior to first dose of study treatment and must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test.\n\n1.10. Written informed consent must be obtained from all participants (>18 years of age) or their legal guardians (if the participant is <18 years of age).

Dental braces or prosthesis that interfere with volumetric analysis of the neurofibroma(s).\n\n2.4. Prior Therapy: Participants may have received treatment for a PN or other tumor/malignancy but must have fully recovered to baseline or CTCAE ≤ Grade 1 from acute toxicities from prior therapies except alopecia.\n\nMyelosuppressive chemotherapy: Must not have received within 28 days of entry onto this study.\n\n2.5.

Biologic (anti-neoplastic agent): At least 28 days (or 5 half-lives whichever is longer) since the completion of therapy with a biologic agent. For agents that have known adverse events occurring beyond 28 days after administration (or 5 half-lives whichever is longer), this period must be extended beyond the time during which adverse events are known to occur. These participants must be discussed with the Study Chair on a case-by-case basis.\n\n2.7. Investigational Drugs: At least 28 days (or 5 half-lives whichever is longer) since the completion of therapy with an investigational drug or systemic anticancer treatment.

Participants may have previously received cabozantinib and/or a MEK inhibitor but not simultaneously. If participants have received either cabozantinib or selumetinib previously, they must have tolerated either medication at the recommended entry doses for this study or greater and must not have discontinued therapy due to toxicity.

Surgery:\n\n2.9.1. Participants are not eligible if complete resection of a PN with acceptable morbidity is feasible, or if a participant with a feasible surgical option with minimal risk for surgical morbidity refuses surgery. Participants who underwent surgery for a progressive PN will be eligible to enter the study after the surgery, provided the PN was incompletely resected and is measurable.\n\n2.9.2. Any major surgery within 3 months before first dose of study treatment.\n\n2.9.3. Any minor surgeries (e.g., the placement of an implanted vascular device, tooth extractions, biopsy, or an invasive operative procedure for procurement of tissue samples or body fluids using a needle or trocar, other than routine peripheral venous access) within 1 month before first dose of study treatment.\n\n2.9.4.

Participants with known glaucoma and increased IOP who do not have meaningful vision (light perception only or no light perception) and are not experiencing pain related to the glaucoma, may be eligible after discussion with the study chair. Participants with orbital plexiform neurofibromas should have IOP measured prior to enrollment.\n\n2.15.4.

Ophthalmological findings secondary to long-standing optic pathway glioma (such as visual loss, optic nerve pallor or strabismus) or long-standing orbito-temporal PN (such as visual loss, strabismus) will NOT be considered a significant abnormality for the purposes of the study.\n\n2.16.

While not an exclusion criterion, unless clinically indicated, participants should avoid taking other additional non-study medications that may interfere with the study medications. Participants should avoid medications that are known to either induce or inhibit the activity of hepatic microsomal isoenzymes CYP1A2, and CYP2C19, as this may interfere with the metabolism of selumetinib (Appendix XIII).\n\n2.22.
