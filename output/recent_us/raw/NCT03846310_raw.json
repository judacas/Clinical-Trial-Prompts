    "inclusion_criteria": "Phase I - Common inclusion criteria for Dose-Escalation / Dose-Expansion:\n\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score of 0 or 1\n* Available RET-gene abnormalities determined on tissue biopsy or liquid biopsy. If deemed appropriate by the investigator, determination on a pleural cell block is also acceptable.\n* Adequate hematopoietic, hepatic and renal function\n\nPhase I Dose-Escalation - Specific inclusion criteria:\n\n* Advanced solid tumors\n* Measurable and/or non-measurable disease as determined by RECIST 1.1\n* If patient has brain and/or leptomeningeal metastases, (s)he should be asymptomatic.\n\nPhase I Dose-Expansion - Specific inclusion criteria:\n\n* Patient with RET gene fusion :\n\n  * Cohort 1, 3: locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC patients naÃ¯ve to RET selective inhibitors and no prior systemic anti-cancer treatment. Patients who have been treated with neo-adjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy may be included if it has been completed at least 6 months prior to the first dose of the study.\n  * Cohort 2, 4: locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC patients with RET gene fusion and prior exposure to RET selective inhibitors.\n* Measurable disease as determined by RECIST 1.1\n* If patient has brain and/or leptomeningeal metastases,(s)he should have:\n\n  * asymptomatic untreated brain/leptomeningeal metastases off steroids and anticonvulsant for at least 7 days or\n  * asymptomatic brain metastases already treated with local therapy and be clinically stable on steroids and anticonvulsant for at least 7 days before study drug administration.\n\nPhase II :\n\n* Available RET-gene abnormalities determined on tissue or liquid biopsy\n* Locally advanced or metastatic:\n\n  * NSCLC patients with primary RET gene fusion and prior exposure to RET selective inhibitors;\n  * NSCLC patients with RET gene fusion and without prior exposure to RET selective inhibitors\n  * patients with advanced solid tumors that harbour RET gene abnormalities (other than NSCLC patients with primary RET gene fusions) and has failed all the available therapeutic options\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score of 0-2\n* Measurable disease as determined by RECIST 1.1\n* If patient has brain and/or leptomeningeal metastases,(s)he should have:\n\n  * asymptomatic untreated brain/leptomeningeal metastases off steroids and anticonvulsant for at least 7 days or\n  * asymptomatic brain metastases already treated with local therapy and be clinically stable on steroids and anticonvulsant for at least 7 days before study drug administration.\n* Adequate hematopoietic, hepatic and renal function\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "Common exclusion criteria for Phase 1 and Phase 2\n\n* Investigational agents or anticancer therapy within 5 half-lives prior to the first dose of study drug\n* Major surgery (excluding placement of vascular access) within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug or planned major surgery during the course of study treatment.\n* Whole Brain Radiotherapy within 14 days or other palliative radiotherapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug, or persisting side effects of such therapy, in the opinion of the Investigator.\n* Clinically significant, uncontrolled, cardiovascular disease including myocardial infarction within 3 months prior to Day 1 of Cycle 1, unstable angina pectoris, significant valvular or pericardial disease, history of ventricular tachycardia, symptomatic Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III-IV, and severe uncontrolled arterial hypertension, according to the Investigator's opinion.\n* QT interval corrected using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) >470 msec; personal or family history of prolonged QT syndrome or history of Torsades de pointes (TdP). History of risk factors for TdP\n* Treatment with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors within 1 week prior to the first dose of study drug or strong CYP3A4 inducers within 3 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug.\n\nPhase I Dose-Expansion - and Phase II specific exclusion criteria:\n\n* Presence of known EGFR, KRAS, ALK, HER2, ROS1, BRAF and METex14 activating mutations.",
