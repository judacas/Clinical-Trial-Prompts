Relevant toxicities of prior therapies must have resolved, except for oxaliplatin-related neuropathy or alopecia\n17. Anticipated life expectancy ≥6 months Subject is willing and able to comply with the requirements of the protocol\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 75 Years",

Prior to the first dose of study treatment, any electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormality at Screening must be documented by the investigator as not medically relevant\n19. Administration of a live, attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks before randomization or anticipation of a live attenuated vaccine will be required during the study\n20. Participant has participated in another clinical study involving an investigational product (IP) or investigational device within 30 days prior to enrollment or is scheduled to participate in another clinical study involving an IP or investigational device during the course of this study\n21. Known hypersensitivity to any component of the investigational drug\n22. If female, participant is pregnant (exclusion confirmed with beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [hCG] test) or lactating at the time of enrollment, or has plans to become pregnant or start breastfeeding during the study\n23.
