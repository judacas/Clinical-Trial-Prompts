    "inclusion_criteria": "Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed stage II-IV lung cancer and be planned for definitive non-surgical therapy.\n\nPatients may have a history of prior malignancy.\n\nMild cancer cachexia, defined by the miniCASCO score of 0-25 points\n\nVitamin D insufficiency, defined as 25(OH)D < 32 ng/ml\n\nAged 45 to 75 years. Stratified randomization by age\n\nECOG performance status ≤ 2 (see Appendix A).\n\nLife expectancy of greater than 3 months\n\nPatients must have normal renal and liver function as defined below:\n\nAST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤2.5 × institutional upper limit of normal creatinine within normal institutional limits OR creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal.\n\nAble to swallow thin liquids\n\nNo uncontrolled illness including, but not limited to, any of the following:\n\n* Ongoing or active serious infection\n* Symptomatic congestive heart failure\n* Unstable angina pectoris\n* Uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia\n* Uncontrolled hypertension\n* Psychiatric illness or social situation that would preclude compliance with study requirements\n\nAbility to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 45 Years\nMust have maximum age of 75 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.\n\nPatients with untreated brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events. Patients with treated brain metastasis are eligible for this trial, providing they have completed treatment at least one day prior to registration.\n\nHistory of allergic reactions to whey or milk proteins.\n\nUncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n\nPatients with a history of calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis are excluded.\n\nPatients with a significant history of malabsorption (e.g. celiac sprue, short bowel syndrome, IBD or other, as determined by the treating physician) are excluded.\n\nPatients will not be eligible if actively receiving treatment for vitamin D deficiency and have had recent (3 month) history of vitamin D supplementation (>1000 IU) or calcium supplementation (>800mg).\n\nThe following exclusion criteria will avoid the possibility of preexisting muscle impairment: history of congenital myopathies; neurologic disorder involving sequelae of spinal derangement; disk disease or vascular disease; tremor and rigidity.\n\nPatients will also be excluded if they report lower extremity (LE) surgery or injury to the LE in the past 3 months or a past medical history of primary hyperparathyroidism; or rhabdomyolysis.\n\nAdditional exclusion criteria include participation in a scheduled resistance exercise program 1 month;\n\n* metal implants or other contraindications for the MRI;\n* diabetes,\n* advanced renal disease,\n* uncontrolled hypertension;\n* a vitamin D status (25(OH)D) of > 32ng/mL.",
