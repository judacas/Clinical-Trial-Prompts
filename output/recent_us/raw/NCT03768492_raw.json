Additional fields to treat the regional nodes including the supraclavicular / axillary and/or internal mammary chains is allowed but not required. If a patient requires a boost field to the chest wall, scar and/or nodal region this is allowed.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Patient with skin changes or inflammatory carcinoma at presentation Patient has (cT4b-d)\n* unhealed wound in the radiation field\n* Patient has allergy to Caffeine\n* Patient has systemic lupus erythematosus or scleroderma that increases the risk of radiation dermatitis development\n* Patient will receive concurrent chemotherapy with radiation. (Patient is allowed to take concurrent hormonal therapy or Trastuzumab)\n* Planned accelerated or hypofractionated fractionation.\n* Previous radiation to the ipsilateral breast or chest wall or thoracic region.\n* Anyone who will require bolus use during radiation (per physician discretion) as this will increase rates of acute toxicity interfering with measurement of the primary study endpoint.\n* All pre-menopausal women will require a urine qualitative pregnancy test to exclude pregnancy.
