    "inclusion_criteria": "* Ischemic Stroke: a neurological deficit attributable to an acute brain infarction and national institute of health stroke score scale (NIHSS) score less than or equal to (<=) 7 and at least 1 of the following: persistent signs or symptoms of the ischemic event at the time of randomization, or acute, ischemic brain lesion determined by standard-of-care neuroimaging, or participant underwent thrombolysis or thrombectomy, or transient ischemic attack (TIA): acute onset neurological deficit attributable to focal ischemia of the brain by history or examination, with complete symptom resolution of the deficit and no brain infarction on neuroimaging (example, computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), performed as part of standard medical practice), and ABCD2 Score greater than or equal to (>=) 6\n* Participants will be randomized as soon as possible after determining eligibility and within 48 hours of onset of event.\n* Current or planned antiplatelet treatment per international and/or local guidelines. If acetyl salicylic acid (ASA) is used, it will be limited to low dose (75 to 100 milligrams (mg)/day). Loading dose of antiplatelet agents (including ASA) are allowed per standard-of-care\n* A female participant must agree not to be pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant until 4 days (5 half lives) after the last dose of study intervention\n* Willing and able to adhere to the lifestyle restrictions specified in this protocol\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 40 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Prior history of intracranial hemorrhage except subarachnoid hemorrhage greater than (>) 1 year prior with adequate treatment\n* The index stroke or TIA is considered to have a cardio-embolic etiology based on local standard-of-care investigations and for which guidelines recommend anticoagulation\n* The index stroke or TIA considered to have another known cause, not related to athero-thrombotic sources (treatment of acute stroke trial [TOAST] Other Determined Etiology), based on local standard-of-care investigations\n* Increased risk of bleeding, including clinically significant bleeding within the previous 3 months or known bleeding diathesis or known activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) prolongation or spinal cord hemorrhage or retinal hemorrhage\n* Current active liver disease, eg, acute hepatitis, known cirrhosis, including participants receiving antiviral treatment for hepatitis\n* Known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to milvexian or its excipients",
