    "inclusion_criteria": "* Documentation of laboratory-confirmed active SARS-CoV-2 infection, as determined by a nucleic acid (for example, reverse-transcriptase PCR) or antigen test from any respiratory tract specimen (for example, oropharyngeal, NP or nasal swab, or saliva) collected ≤72 hours (3 days) prior to randomization.\n* Participants are expected to begin study intervention ≤3 days from self-reported date of onset of any of the COVID-19-related symptoms from the following list:\n* Cough\n* Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing\n* Feeling feverish\n* Chills\n* Fatigue\n* Body pain or muscle pain or aches\n* Diarrhea\n* Nausea\n* Vomiting\n* Headache\n* Sore throat\n* Nasal obstruction or congestion\n* Nasal discharge\n* Loss of taste\n* Loss of smell\n* One or more of the following signs/symptoms present within 24 hours prior to randomization:\n* Cough\n* Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing\n* Feeling feverish\n* Chills\n* Fatigue\n* Body pain or muscle pain or aches\n* Diarrhea\n* Nausea\n* Vomiting\n* Headache\n* Sore throat\n* Nasal obstruction or congestion\n* Nasal discharge\n* Participants at higher risk of progression to severe COVID-19 are defined as follows:\n* Age ≥65 years\n* Age ≥18 with 1 of the following:\n* Obesity (body mass index [BMI] ≥30 kilograms per square meter [kg/m^2]). Note: BMI is rounded to the nearest whole number, for example 29.5 kg/m^2 is rounded to 30 kg/m^2.\n* Diabetes mellitus\n* Hypertension requiring daily prescribed therapy\n* Cardiovascular disease (requiring daily prescribed therapy or congenital heart disease)\n* Chronic lung disease (for example, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, moderate to severe asthma, interstitial lung disease, cystic fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension) requiring daily prescribed therapy\n* Chronic kidney disease, defined as known current kidney impairment with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 milliliters (mL)/minute (min)/1.73 square meter (m^2) within the past 12 months prior to randomization, as long as the participant does not have known CrCl <30 mL/min by Cockcroft-Gault or require dialysis\n* Down syndrome\n* Sickle cell disease\n* One of the following immunocompromising conditions or immunosuppressive treatments:\n* Receiving chemotherapy or other therapies for cancer\n* Hematologic malignancy (active or in remission)\n* History of a hematopoietic stem cell or a solid organ transplant\n* Human immunodeficiency virus infection: not on antiretroviral therapy or with cluster of differentiation 4+ cell count <200 cells per cubic millimeter\n* Combined primary immunodeficiency disorder\n* Taking immunosuppressive medications (for example, drugs to suppress rejection of transplanted organs or to treat rheumatologic and gastrointestinal conditions, such as anti-tumor necrosis factor agents, mycophenolate, and rituximab).\n\nNote: Current use of some corticosteroids is exclusionary, due to concern for possible drug-drug interaction (DDI) with S-217622.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* History of hospitalization for the current SARS-CoV-2 infection (that is, prior hospitalization for a prior episode of SARS-CoV-2 infection is allowable)\n* For the current SARS-CoV-2 infection, any positive SARS-CoV-2 molecular (nucleic acid) or antigen test from any respiratory tract specimen (for example, oropharyngeal, NP, or nasal swab, or saliva) collected ˃72 hours (3 days) prior to randomization. Participants with reinfection, defined as prior SARS-CoV-2 infection that began >90 days prior to the current onset of symptoms with interval resolution of symptoms are eligible as long as the current infection has not been present for more than 3 days prior to randomization.\n* Current need for hospitalization or immediate medical attention in the opinion of the investigator\n* Current use of any medications prohibited with the study intervention. Individuals who have used Paxlovid or any other oral, inhaled, or injectable medication intended to treat the current SARS-CoV-2 infection before randomization are excluded. After randomization, locally available SARS-CoV-2 treatment (including but not limited to molnupiravir, mAbs, outpatient IV remdesivir, convalescent plasma, inhaled budesonide, favipiravir, and fluvoxamine) will be permitted, as long as there are no concerns for DDIs.\n\nNote: Paxlovid use for a prior episode of COVID-19 is permitted.\n\n* Receipt of any investigational treatments for the current episode of SARS-CoV-2 at any time prior to randomization is exclusionary. Note: This does not include drugs approved for other uses and taken for those indications or COVID-19 vaccines. Note: Use of locally authorized or approved therapies to prevent COVID-19, such as mAbs given solely to prevent COVID-19, are not exclusionary.\n* Any co-morbidity requiring surgery within 7 days prior to randomization or that is considered life threatening in the opinion of the investigator within 28 days prior to randomization\n* Known allergy/sensitivity or any hypersensitivity to components of S-217622 or placebo for S-217622\n* Known (within 12 months prior to randomization) renal impairment defined as CrCl <30 mL/min by Cockcroft-Gault or requiring dialysis\n* Known history of cirrhosis or liver decompensation (including ascites, variceal bleeding, or hepatic encephalopathy)\n* Participants who have used any of the following drugs within 14 days prior to randomization:\n* Strong cytochrome P453A (CYP 3A) inhibitor\n* Strong CYP3A inducer\n* Products containing St. John's Wort",
