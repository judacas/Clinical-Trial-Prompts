    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Subject is ≥18 years of age\n2. Subject has signed the Ethics Committee (EC) or Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved trial Informed Consent Form (ICF) prior to any trial related tests/procedures and is willing to comply with trial procedures and required follow-up assessments\n3. Subject is diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or liver metastases (mets) from other primary cancers\n4. Subject is able to undergo general anesthesia\n5. Subject has a Child-Pugh Score of A or B\n6. Subject has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) grade 0-2 at baseline screening\n7. Subject meets the following functional criteria, ≤7 days prior to the index-procedure:\n\n   * Liver function: Alanine transaminase (ALT) and Aspartate transaminase (AST) <2.5x upper limit of normal (ULN) and/or bilirubin <2.5 ULN, and\n   * Renal function: serum creatinine <2x ULN, and\n   * Hematologic function: neutrophil count >1.0 x 10^9/L and platelet >50 x 10^9/L\n8. Subject has an International Normalized Ratio (INR) score of <2.0 , ≤7 days prior to the index procedure\n9. Subject has not responded to and/or has relapsed and/or is intolerant of other available therapies including locoregional therapies, chemotherapy, immunotherapy and targeted therapies\n10. The tumor(s) selected for histotripsy treatment must be ≤3 cm in longest diameter\n11. Subject has an adequate acoustic window to visualize targeted tumor(s) using ultrasound imaging\n12. Subject has a maximum of three (3) tumors to be treated with histotripsy during the index procedure, regardless of how many tumors the subject has.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Subject is pregnant or planning to become pregnant or nursing (lactating) during the trial period\n2. Subject is enrolled in another investigational trial and/or is taking investigational medication and/or has been treated with an investigational device ≤30-days prior to planned index procedure date\n3. In the Investigator's opinion, the subject has co-morbid disease(s) or condition(s) that would cause undue risk and preclude safe use of the HistoSonics System\n4. Subject has a serum creatinine >2.0 mg/dL or estimated glomerular filtration rate (EGFR) <30, unless on dialysis\n5. Subject has major surgical procedure or significant traumatic injury ≤2 weeks prior to the planned index procedure or not fully recovered (CTCAE grade 1 or better) from side effects/complications of such procedure or trauma\n6. Subject has not recovered to common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE) grade 1 or better from any adverse effects (except alopecia, fatigue, nausea, vomiting and peripheral neuropathy) related to previous anti-cancer therapy\n7. Subject has a history of, or suspected to have, bleeding disorders that are uncorrectable\n8. Subject has coagulopathy that is uncorrectable\n9. Subject has a planned cancer treatment (e.g. resection, chemotherapy, etc.) after the planned index-procedure date and prior to completion of the 30-day follow-up visit\n10. Subject has previous treatment with bevacizumab that has not been discontinued >40 days prior to the planned index-procedure date\n11. Subject has planned bevacizumab treatment prior to completion of the 30-day follow-up visit\n12. Subject has previous treatments with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy that has not been discontinued ≥2 weeks prior to the planned index-procedure date and has not recovered (CTCAE grade 1 or better) from related toxicity (except alopecia and peripheral neuropathy)\n13. Subject has previous treatment with immunotherapies that has not been discontinued ≥4 weeks prior to the index-procedure and has not recovered from related toxicity (CTCAE grade 1 or better)\n14. Subject has a life expectancy less than six (<6) months\n15. In the opinion of the Investigator, histotripsy is not a treatment option for the subject\n16. Subject has a concurrent condition that, in the investigator's opinion, could jeopardize the safety of the subject or compliance with the protocol\n17. Subjects' tumor(s) is not treatable by the System's working ranges (refer to User Manual)\n18. Subject has a known sensitivity to contrast media and cannot be adequately pre-medicated\n19. Subjects' target tumor(s) has/have had prior locoregional therapy (e.g. ablation, embolization, radiation)\n20. Subject is eligible for surgical resection\n21. Targeted tumor(s) treatment volume overlaps a non-targeted tumor visible via imaging\n22. The targeted tumor(s) is not clearly visible with diagnostic ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging\n23. The targeted tumor(s) is located in liver segment 1\n24. The Planned Treatment Volume intended to cover the targeted tumor includes or encompasses any portion of the main portal vein, common hepatic duct, common bile duct, gallbladder or stomach/bowel.",
