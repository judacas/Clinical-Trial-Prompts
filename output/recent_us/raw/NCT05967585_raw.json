Participants with CRPC who have metastatic disease that is non-measurable are eligible if screening PSA ≥ 2.0 ng/mL and with Sponsor approval\n6. Failure to respond to standard therapy, or for whom no appropriate therapies are available (based on the judgment of the investigator)\n7. Consent to baseline biopsy, with the following exceptions:\n\n   1. Participants whose only site(s) of disease are in areas considered moderate or high risk may be enrolled without a fresh biopsy with Sponsor approval;\n   2. Archival tissue may be submitted in lieu of a fresh biopsy if collected within 6 months of screening and without intervening systemic therapy.\n8. Participants must have adequate hematologic function based on the following:\n\n   * ANC ≥ 1.5 x 109/L\n   * Platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L\n   * Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL\n9. Participants must have adequate hepatic function based on the following:\n\n   * Total bilirubin < 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) (unless elevated due to Gilbert's syndrome)\n   * ALT/AST ≤ 2.5 x ULN (≤ 5 x ULN for participants with known hepatic metastases)\n10. Participants must have adequate renal function based on the following:\n\n    * Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN; or\n    * Serum creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min, as determined by Cockcroft-Gault equation\n11. For women of childbearing potential (WCBP): negative urine pregnancy test (UPT) within 1 week before first treatment (WCBP defined as a sexually mature woman who has not undergone surgical sterilization or who has not been naturally post-menopausal for at least 12 consecutive months for women > 55 years of age). WCBP should be placed on effective birth control directly after testing negative for pregnancy; if not, then WCBP should have a UPT on Day 1 of every cycle, prior to study intervention administration. Any positive or indeterminant UPT result must be confirmed by serum.\n\n    a. Female participants of childbearing potential must use a highly effective mode of contraception or abstain from heterosexual activity for the duration of the study and for 120 days following the last dose of study intervention. A female is NOT of childbearing potential if she has undergone bilateral salpingoophorectomy or is menopausal, defined as an absence of menses for 12 consecutive months. Male participants must agree to use highly effective contraception.\n12. Ability to adhere to the study visit schedule and all protocol requirements\n13. Must be able to swallow capsules\n\nParticipants will be excluded from the study if they satisfy any of the following criteria at the Screening visit unless otherwise stated:\n\nParticipants are to be excluded from the study if they meet any of the following criteria:\n\n1. Major surgery within 4 weeks prior to Screening\n2. Participants with active CNS metastases; however, participants who have undergone radiation and/or surgery for the treatment of CNS metastases, who are neurologically stable and who are no longer taking pharmacologic doses of corticosteroids are eligible; participants with leptomeningeal metastases are not eligible.\n3. Has received prior radiotherapy within 2 weeks of start of study intervention. Participants must have recovered from all radiation-related toxicities, not require corticosteroids and not have had radiation pneumonitis. A 1-week washout is permitted for palliative radiation (≤ 2 weeks of radiotherapy) to non-CNS disease.\n4. Prior anti-cancer therapy within 4 weeks prior to the start of study intervention. A 2 week washout is acceptable for short-acting drugs (eg, tyrosine kinase inhibitors). Any treatment-related toxicities must be resolved to Grade 0 - 1.\n5. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected participants\n6. Participants who are hepatitis B surface antigen positive are eligible if they have received hepatitis B virus (HBV) antiviral therapy for at least 4 weeks and have undetectable HBV viral load prior to enrollment.\n\n   Note: Participants should remain on antiviral therapy throughout study intervention and follow local guidelines for HBV antiviral therapy post completion of study intervention.\n\n   Hepatitis B screening tests are not required unless:\n   * Known history of HBV infection\n   * As mandated by local health authority\n7. Participants with a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are eligible if HCV viral load is undetectable at Screening. Note: Participants must have completed curative antiviral therapy at least 4 weeks prior to enrollment.\n\n   Hepatitis C screening tests are not required unless:\n   * Known history of HCV infection\n   * As mandated by local health authority\n8.
