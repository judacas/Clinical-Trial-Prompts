Female and male condoms should not be used together.)\n* Male patients, even if surgically sterilized (i.e., status post-vasectomy), who: agree to practice highly effective barrier contraception during the entire study treatment period and through 120 days after the last dose of study drug, OR agree to practice true abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. (Periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods for the female partner], withdrawal, spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea are not acceptable methods of contraception. Female and male condoms should not be used together.)

Exception: Patients may have received palliative low dose radiotherapy to the limbs 1-4 weeks before this therapy provided pelvis, sternum, scapulae, vertebrae, or skull were not included in the radiotherapy field. Patients who have received non-chemotherapeutic biological agents will need to wait at least 5 half-lives or 4 weeks, whichever is shorter, from the last day of treatment of non-chemotherapeutic biological agents.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Carboplatin or paclitaxel exposure within past 6 months.\n* Central nervous system (CNS) metastasis.\n* Other clinically significant co-morbidities, such as uncontrolled pulmonary disease, active central nervous system disease, active infection, or any other condition that could compromise the patient's participation in the study.\n* Known history of human immunodeficiency virus infection.\n* Known history of hepatitis B surface antigen-positive, or known or suspected active hepatitis C infection.\n* Any serious medical or psychiatric illness that could, in the investigator's opinion, potentially interfere with the completion of treatment according to this protocol.\n* Diagnosed or treated for another malignancy within 2 years before administration of the first dose of study drug, or previously diagnosed with another malignancy and have any evidence of residual disease. Patients with non-melanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of any type are not excluded if they have undergone complete resection.\n* Breast feeding or pregnant.\n* Treatment with any investigational products within 4 weeks before the first dose of study drug.\n* Previous treatment with dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors, TORC1/2 inhibitors or TORC1 inhibitors.\n* Manifestations of malabsorption due to prior gastrointestinal (GI) surgery, GI disease, or for an unknown reason that may alter the absorption of TAK-228. In addition, patients with enteric stomata are also excluded.\n* History of any of the following within the last 6 months before administration of the first dose of the drug: a) Ischemic myocardial event, including angina requiring therapy and artery revascularization procedures b) Ischemic cerebrovascular event, including transient ischemic attack and artery revascularization procedures c) Requirement for inotropic support (excluding digoxin) or serious (uncontrolled) cardiac arrhythmia (including atrial flutter/fibrillation, ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia) d) Placement of a pacemaker for control of rhythm e) New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV heart failure f) Pulmonary embolism.\n* Significant active cardiovascular or pulmonary disease including: a) Uncontrolled hypertension (i.e., systolic blood pressure > 150 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure > 90 mm Hg).
