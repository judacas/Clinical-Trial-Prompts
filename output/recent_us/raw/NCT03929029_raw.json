    "inclusion_criteria": "* The patient or a legally authorized representative must provide study-specific informed consent prior to study entry.\n* Age ≥ 18 years of age.\n* Karnofsky performance status (KPS) of ≥ 70%.\n* Subjects with either 1) non-metastatic biopsy proven adenocarcinoma of the prostate who have chosen AS the treatment option for their prostate cancer or 2) have the diagnosis of either MGUS or low-risk SMM and are currently on observation alone.\n* For patients with MGUS or low-risk SMM, diagnosis must be according to the definition of the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG).\n\n  1. MGUS: serum M-protein <3.0g/dL, <10% clonal plasma cells (PCs) in the bone marrow, and absence of end-organ damage (CRAB criteria) that can be attributed to the plasma cell disorder.\n  2. SMM: serum M-protein of ≥3.0g/dL or a proportion of clonal PCs in the BM of ≥10% but <60%, and no evidence of end organ damage as described below.\n\n     * Absence of end organ damage is defined by absence of CRAB criteria:\n\n       * C: Absence of hypercalcemia, defined as calcium ≤11mg/dL.\n       * R: Absence of renal failure, defined as serum creatinine ≤2.0mg/dL.\n       * A: Absence of anemia, defined as hemoglobin ≥10g/dL.\n       * B: Absence of lytic bone lesions per IMWG recommendations: One of either PET-CT, low-dose whole-body CT, or whole- body MRI. Increased uptake on PET-CT alone is not adequate for the diagnosis of multiple myeloma; evidence of underlying osteolytic bone destruction is needed on the CT portion of the examination.\n* At least one of the risk factors below that portends for an increased risk of progression to MM:\n\n  * Abnormal serum free light chain ratio.\n  * M-spike ≥2.0g/dL.\n  * ≥ 20% bone marrow clonal plasma cells.\n  * Immunoparesis ≥20% reduction from institutional normal standard of uninvolved immunoglobulins.\n\nExclusion Criteria\n\n* Currently taking supplements containing either curcumin or piperine.\n* Plan to start any additional over the counter supplements prior to or during trial period.\n* For prostate cancer patients must not be planning to undergoing primary curative therapy for their prostate cancer (radiation, surgery, brachytherapy).\n* For MGUS/ SMM patients, must not have had evidence of disease progression which might require treatment during the one-year study period.\n* Other: symptomatic plasma cell leukemia, amyloidosis, POEMS syndrome (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal protein).\n* Subject is pregnant or breast feeding, or planning to become pregnant during the treatment period.\n* Evidence of any of the following conditions per subject self-report or medical chart review: Major surgery or significant traumatic injury occurring within 4 weeks before enrollment.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
