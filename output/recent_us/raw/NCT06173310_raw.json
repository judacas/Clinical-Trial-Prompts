    "official_title": "A Phase 3 Open-Label, Randomized, Controlled, Global Study of Telisotuzumab Vedotin (ABBV-399) Versus Docetaxel in Subjects With Previously Treated c-Met Overexpressing, EGFR Wildtype, Locally Advanced/Metastatic Non-Squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Projected life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.\n* Participants must have c-Met overexpressing non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) as assessed by an AbbVie designated immunohistochemistry (IHC) laboratory using the VENTANA MET (SP44) RxDx assay.\n* Archival or fresh tumor material must be submitted for assessment of c-Met levels during the Pre-Screening period. Tumor material from the primary tumor site and/or metastatic sites are allowed.\n\n  * If a participant was prescreened for Study M14-239 but did not enroll, tumor material previously submitted for Study M14-239 may be used for Study M18-868 Pre-Screening upon confirmation from AbbVie that sufficient evaluable tumor material is available (Except China).\n* A histologically or cytologically documented non-squamous cell NSCLC that is locally advanced or metastatic.\n* A known epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activating mutation status.\n* Actionable alterations in genes other than EGFR .\n* Measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1.\n* An Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 to 1.\n* Have received no more than 1 line of prior systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy in the locally advanced or metastatic setting.\n\n  * Neoadjuvant and adjuvant systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy will count as a prior line for eligibility purposes if progression occurred within 6 months of the end of therapy.\n* Have progressed on at least 1 line of prior therapy for locally advanced/metastatic NSCLC:\n\n  * Participants WITHOUT an actionable gene alteration: must have progressed on (or be considered ineligible for) platinum-based chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitor (as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy).\n  * Participants WITH an actionable gene alteration for which immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy is not standard of care (e.g., anaplastic lymphoma kinase [ALK] translocation): must have progressed on (or be considered ineligible for) anti-cancer therapy targeting driver gene alterations and platinum-based chemotherapy.\n\n    * Participants with actionable gene alterations for which immune checkpoint inhibitor is standard of care must have also progressed on (or be considered ineligible for) immune checkpoint inhibitor (as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy).\n* Must be considered appropriate for docetaxel therapy based on the assessment of the treating physician.\n* Participants with metastases to the central nervous system (CNS) are eligible only after adequate treatment (such as surgery, radiotherapy, or drug therapy) is provided and:\n\n  * They are asymptomatic and off or on a stable or reducing dose of systemic steroids (on no more than 10 mg per day [QD] prednisone or equivalent) and/or anticonvulsants for at least 2 weeks prior to randomization.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Evidence of new, untreated CNS metastases.\n* Evidence of leptomeningeal disease.\n* Participants with adenosquamous or neuroendocrine histology, nor sarcomatoid features.\n* Actionable epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activating mutations.\n* Participants who have received prior c-Met-targeted antibodies, prior telisotuzumab vedotin, or prior antibody-drug conjugates either targeting c-Met or consisting of monomethylauristatin E..\n* Participants who have received prior docetaxel therapy.\n* A history of other malignancies except:\n\n  * Malignancy treated with curative intent and with no known active disease present for >=2 years before the first dose of study drug and felt to be at low risk for recurrence by investigator.\n  * Adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer or lentigo maligna without evidence of disease.\n  * Adequately treated carcinoma in situ without current evidence of disease.\n* A history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, organizing pneumonia (e.g., bronchiolitis obliterans), drug-induced pneumonitis, or idiopathic pneumonitis, or evidence of active pneumonitis on screening chest computed tomography (CT) scan. A history of prior radiation pneumonitis in the radiation field (fibrosis) is permitted.\n* Unresolved or neuroendocrine histology, nor sarcomatoid features adverse event (AE) >= Grade 2 from prior anticancer therapy, except for alopecia or anemia. Participants with hormone deficiencies caused by prior anticancer therapy who are asymptomatic and on a stable dose of replacement hormone are eligible for study.\n* Major surgery within 21 days prior to randomization.\n* Clinically significant condition(s) as listed in the protocol.",
