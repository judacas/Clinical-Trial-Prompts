    "inclusion_criteria": "1. The patient provides written informed consent for the trial. Spanish speaking patients will be included and translation services will be provided as needed.\n2. Male or female, 18 years of age or older, on the day of informed consent signing.\n3. Stage I Non Small Cell Lung Cancer, tumor less than 4 cm\n4. Measurable disease according to the Response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST 1.1) within 30 days of treatment.\n5. Expected life expectancy of at least 6 months\n6. Adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:\n\n   Hemoglobin ≥9.0 g/dl (without blood transfusion within 2 weeks of laboratory test used to determine eligibility) Absolute neutrophil count ≥1000/μL (without granulocyte colony stimulating factor support within 2 weeks of laboratory test used to determine eligibility) Platelet count ≥100,000/μL (without transfusion within 2 weeks of laboratory test used to determine eligibility)- Serum total bilirubin (TB) ≤1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN; In the case of known Gilbert's syndrome, a higher serum TB [>1.5 x ULN] is allowed), Aspartate transaminase/alanine transaminase ≤5 x institutional ULN Creatinine ≤1.5X the ULN or measured creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.\n7. Willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the trial including undergoing treatment and scheduled visits and examinations.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Currently participating and receiving study therapy or has participated in a study of an investigational agent and received study therapy or used an investigational device within 3 weeks of trial treatment administration.\n2. Prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy within 2 weeks prior to trial treatment administration or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from Adverse Events (AEs) due to a previously administered agent.\n3. Use of agents that target the mitochondrial metabolism.\n4. Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment. Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical cancer.\n5. The patient has serious and/or uncontrolled preexisting medical condition(s) that, in the judgment of the investigator, would preclude participation in this study (for example, interstitial lung disease, severe dyspnea at rest or requiring oxygen therapy, severe renal impairment [e.g. estimated creatinine clearance <30ml/min], history of major surgical resection involving the stomach or small bowel, or preexisting Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis or a preexisting chronic condition resulting in baseline Grade 2 or higher diarrhea).\n6. History or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the patient's participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of the patient to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.\n7. Known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial.\n8. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of ≥ 2.\n9. Patients must have recovered from all AEs due to previous therapies to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline. Patients with ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy may be eligible. If patient received major surgery, she must have recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting the trial treatment.\n10. Active infection requiring systemic therapy.\n11. Confirmed positive pregnancy test in women of childbearing potential (WOCBP).",
