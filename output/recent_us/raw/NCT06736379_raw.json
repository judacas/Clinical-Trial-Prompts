    "inclusion_criteria": "* Patient must have one of the following:\n\n  * Relapsed or refractory primary central nervous system (CNS) diffuse large B cell lymphoma (PCNSDLBCL) with a brain lesion >= 1 cm, or with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) relapse with positive CSF cytology, or with ocular relapse with positive ocular tissue biopsy\n\n    * NOTE: Tissue biopsy is not absolutely necessary for brain tumor unless clinical and radiologic findings strongly suggest other etiologies as per treating physician. Initial diagnosis must be made by tissue biopsy OR\n  * Relapsed/refractory primary vitreoretinal diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) with a CNS lesion >= 1 cm, or with CSF relapse with positive CSF cytology, or with ocular relapse with positive ocular tissue biopsy. Relapsed PVRL must have progressed or failed at least one systemic regimen\n\n    * NOTE: Intraocular treatments are not regarded as systemic therapy\n    * NOTE: If recurrence in ocular or leptomeningeal space, the patient will need a positive ocular tissue biopsy and CSF biopsy. Tissue biopsy requirement of the CNS lesion is as outlined in bullet above\n* Patient progressed after or did not respond to at least 1 line of systemic therapy (e.g., high-dose methotrexate, high-dose methotrexate based regimen, high dose cytarabine, etc)\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 0, 1, 2 or 3\n* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >= 1500/mm^3 (within =< 14 days prior to registration)\n* Platelet count >= 100,000/mm^3 (within =< 14 days prior to registration)\n* Hemoglobin >= 9.0 g/dL (within =< 14 days prior to registration)\n* Direct bilirubin < 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) (or total bilirubin =< 3.0 x ULN with direct bilirubin =< 1.5 x ULN in patients with well-documented Gilbert?s Syndrome) (within =< 14 days prior to registration)\n* Aspartate transaminase (AST) =< 3 x ULN (within =< 14 days prior to registration)\n* Creatinine =< 1.5 x ULN OR calculated creatinine clearance must be >= 45 ml/min using the Cockcroft-Gault formula (within =< 14 days prior to registration)\n* Prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR)/partial thromboplastin time (PTT) =< 1.5 x ULN OR if patient is receiving anticoagulant therapy and PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants (within =< 14 days prior to registration)\n* Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test with a sensitivity of at least 50 mIU/ml, =< 14 days prior to registration and within 24 hours of starting pomalidomide. In addition, must either commit to continue abstinence from heterosexual intercourse or begin TWO acceptable methods of birth control, one highly effective method and one additional effective method AT THE SAME TIME, at least 28 days before she starts taking pomalidomide. WOCBP must also agree to ongoing pregnancy testing. Men must agree to use a latex condom during sexual contact with a WOCBP even if they have had a vasectomy. In addition, women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) receiving nivolumab will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 5 months after the last dose of nivolumab. Men receiving nivolumab and who are sexually active with WOCBP will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 7 months after the last dose of nivolumab.

    "exclusion_criteria": "* Any of the following because this study involves an investigational agent whose genotoxic, mutagenic and teratogenic effects on the developing fetus and newborn are unknown:\n\n  * Pregnant women\n  * Nursing women\n  * Men or women of childbearing potential who are unwilling to employ adequate contraception\n* Co-morbid systemic illnesses or other severe concurrent disease which, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study or interfere significantly with the proper assessment of safety and toxicity of the prescribed regimens\n* Immunocompromised patients and patients known to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements\n* Other concurrent chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, or any ancillary therapy considered investigational (utilized for a non-Food and Drug Administration [FDA]-approved indication and in the context of a research investigation)\n* Other active malignancy =< 3 years prior to registration\n\n  * EXCEPTIONS: Non-melanotic skin cancer or carcinoma-in-situ of the cervix\n  * NOTE: If there is a history of prior malignancy, they must not have received immune checkpoint inhibitors or immunomodulatory therapy (IMiD) for their cancer\n* History of myocardial infarction =< 6 months prior to registration, or congestive heart failure requiring use of ongoing maintenance therapy for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias\n* The development of erythema nodosum if characterized by a desquamating rash while taking thalidomide or similar drugs\n* Use of corticosteroid in the absence of cerebral edema\n\n  * NOTE: If a corticosteroid is used, it should be used at the lowest dose possible for the shortest possible duration.
