For patients with HCV infection who are currently on treatment, they are eligible if they have an undetectable HCV viral load\n* Patients with treated brain metastases are eligible if follow-up brain imaging after central nervous system (CNS)-directed therapy shows no evidence of progression\n* Patients with new or progressive brain metastases (active brain metastases) or leptomeningeal disease are eligible if the treating physician determines that immediate CNS-specific treatment is not required and is unlikely to be required during the first cycle of study treatment\n* Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen are eligible for this trial\n* Life expectancy ≥ 3 months\n* Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum pregnancy test result within 3 days of study treatment initiation\n* Agents composed of HER2 antibody conjugated to a topoisomerase 1 inhibitor and azenosertib (ZN-c3) are known to be teratogenic; thus, WOCBP must agree to use highly effective contraception from time of screening and throughout the study treatment period and for at least 7 months after final study treatment administration. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.

Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception methods outlined for WOCBP if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their postmenopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraception method\n* Male patients involved with WOCBP must agree to use a highly effective form of contraception or avoid intercourse from time of screening and throughout the study treatment period and for at least 4 months after the last dose of study treatment.

    "exclusion_criteria": "* As azenosertib (ZN-c3) is a substrate of CYP3A4, use of prescription or non-prescription drugs known to be moderate or strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 are prohibited with the exception of moderate or strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 that are part of the prophylactic antiemetic regimen. Chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine are metabolized by CYP3A4 and therefore, should be prohibited. For patients who have received prior moderate or strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4, the required washout period is approximately 5 half-lives prior to study treatment initiation\n* Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents\n* Patients who have a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to the study drugs\n* Patients who have a history of severe hypersensitivity reactions to other monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)\n* Patients with clinically severe pulmonary compromise resulting from intercurrent pulmonary illnesses including, but not limited to, any underlying pulmonary disorder (i.e., pulmonary emboli within 3 months of the study enrollment, severe asthma, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, restrictive lung disease, pleural effusion, etc.), and any autoimmune, connective tissue or inflammatory disorders with potential pulmonary involvement (i.e., rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren's, sarcoidosis, etc.), or prior pneumonectomy\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because T-DXd (DS-8201a) and azenosertib (ZN-c3) have the potential risk for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for AEs in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with T-DXd (DS-8201a) and azenosertib (ZN-c3), breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with T-DXd (DS-8201a) or azenosertib (ZN-c3)\n* Patients with history of non-infectious pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease (ILD), current ILD, or where suspected ILD cannot be ruled out by imaging at screening\n* Patients with active infections requiring antibiotics at the time of study treatment initiation are not eligible\n* Patients with history of malabsorption syndrome or other condition that would interfere with enteral absorption or results in the inability or unwillingness to swallow pills\n* Patients with current signs or symptoms of bowel obstruction including sub-occlusive disease related to underlying disease\n* Patients with a medical history of myocardial infarction within 6 months before enrollment, symptomatic congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association class IIb to IV), and/or troponin levels consistent with myocardial infarction as defined according to the manufacturer 28 days prior to enrollment\n* Patients with clinically significant corneal disease\n* Patients with a pleural effusion, ascites, or pericardial effusion that requires drainage, peritoneal shunt, or cell-free and concentrated ascites reinfusion therapy (CART).
