    "official_title": "A Phase II Study of Carboplatin, Cabazitaxel and Abiraterone in High Volume Metastatic Castration Sensitive Prostate Cancer",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Willing and able to provide, or have a legally authorized representative provide, written informed consent and HIPAA authorization for the release of personal health information. A signed informed consent must be obtained before screening procedures are performed.\n* Histologically confirmed prostate cancer.\n* High volume metastatic disease (defined as the presence of visceral metastases or ≥3 bone lesions).\n* ADT for ≤3 months by day 1 of study chemotherapy; Prior episodes of ADT are allowed (i.e. ADT used previously in courses of radiation).\n* Testosterone <50 ng/dL. Patients must continue primary ADT with an LHRH analogue if they have not undergone orchiectomy.\n* ECOG Performance Status 0 or 1 (see Appendix A)\n* Patient has adequate bone marrow and organ function as defined by the following laboratory values:\n\n  * Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 × 10^9/L\n  * Platelets ≥ 100 × 10^9/L\n  * Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dl\n  * Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5mg/dL or estimated creatinine clearance ≥ 50 ml/min\n  * In the absence of liver metastases, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) <2.5 x ULN. If the patient has liver metastases, ALT and AST <5 x ULN\n  * Total bilirubin < ULN; or total bilirubin ≤3.0 x ULN or direct bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN in patients with well-documented Gilbert's Syndrome.\n* Sexually active males must use a condom during intercourse while taking study drugs and for 30 days after stopping treatment and should not father a child in this period. A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent delivery of the drug via seminal fluid. Fertile males must use a condom with spermicide (double barrier method).\n* Age ≥ 18 years\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be MALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Prior exposure to any chemotherapy, PARPi, or immunotherapy for prostate cancer.\n* Prior abiraterone or enzalutamide, unless therapy was for < 2 weeks\n* Radiation therapy (including palliative radiotherapy to a metastatic lesion) within 14 days or major surgery (e.g., open abdominal, pelvic, thoracic, orthopedic or neurosurgery) within 28 days of the date of the first dose.\n* Other systemic therapies for prostate cancer within 28 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter, prior to day 1 of chemotherapy (with the exception of anti-androgens like bicalutamide).\n* PSA <2.0 ng/mL at diagnosis.\n* If present, peripheral neuropathy must be ≤ Grade 1\n* Patients with an active second malignancy that could, in the investigator's opinion, potentially interfere with the patient's ability to participate and/or complete this trial.\n* Patients with central nervous system (CNS) involvement unless they meet ALL of the following criteria:\n\n  * At least 4 weeks from prior therapy completion (including radiation and/or surgery) prior to starting the study treatment\n  * Clinically stable CNS tumor at the time of screening.\n  * Baseline screening for CNS metastases is not required unless presence of signs and/or symptoms of involvement\n* Patients with severe psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements in the judgment of treating investigator.\n* Patient has a history of non-compliance to medical regimen or inability to grant consent.",
