No HIV testing is required unless mandated by local health authority\n* The use of corticosteroids is not allowed for 10 days prior to initiation of therapy (based upon 5 times the expected half-life of dexamethasone) except patients who are taking steroids for physiological replacement. If alternative corticosteroid therapy has been used, consultation with the PI is required to determine the washout period prior to initiating study treatment\n* Subjects with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (> 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study initiation. Inhaled or topical steroids, and adrenal replacement steroid doses > 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent, are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease\n* Major surgical procedure, open biopsy (excluding skin cancer resection), or significant traumatic injury within 14 days of initiating study drug (unless the wound has healed) or anticipation of the need for major surgery during the study\n* Non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture\n* Women who are breast-feeding or pregnant\n* Subjects with a history of serious intercurrent chronic or acute illness, such as cardiac or pulmonary disease, hepatic disease, bleeding diathesis or recent major bleeding events or other illness considered by the Investigator as high risk for investigational drug treatment\n* Arterial or venous thrombotic or embolic events such as cerebrovascular accident (including transient ischemic attacks), deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism within the 6 months before start of study medication (except for adequately treated catheter-related venous thrombosis occurring more than 1 month before the start of study medication)\n* History of clinically significant cardiac disease or congestive heart failure > New York Heart Association (NYHA) class 2.
