    "inclusion_criteria": "* Group 1 will consist of women who present for screening breast MRI:\n\n  * Age >= 18\n  * Female\n  * Asymptomatic for breast disease\n  * Presenting for routine breast cancer screening with MRI\n* Group 2 will consist of women who presented for a screening mammogram (2D or 3D tomosynthesis) AND who have had a biopsy recommended after diagnostic workup:\n\n  * Age >= 18\n  * Female\n  * Asymptomatic for breast disease\n  * Presenting for routine breast cancer screening with mammogram (2D or 3D tomosynthesis) and/or ultrasound\n  * Biopsy recommended after subsequent diagnostic workup (BI-RADS 4 or 5)\n\nRadiologist Reader Participant\n\nInclusion Criteria\n\n* Must have clinical experience in interpreting breast MRI.\n* Must have interpreted at least 10 breast MRI exams with RSI interpretation.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be FEMALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "-Known or suspected renal insufficiency, rendering the participant unable to safely receive intravenous contrast based on institutional clinical protocol.\n\nRenal insufficiency for the purposes of exclusion includes any of the following:\n\n* Failed Chokye questionnaire\n* Known history of end stage renal disease with EGFR<30 mL/min/1.73m2\n* Point of care (POC) measure of creatinine clearance (eGFR) prior to obtaining the MRI <35. We will perform this POC test as needed per institutional policy for routine MRI if: (a) no creatinine result is available in the OMR within 30 days of the MRI exam, (b) the patient is > 60 years old, or (c) the patient is on hydroxyurea.\n\n  * History of adverse or allergic-like reaction to gadolinium MRI intravenous contrast, rendering the participant unable to safely receive intravenous contrast based on institutional clinical protocol.\n  * Presence of MRI unsafe devices or objects which would make having an MRI unsafe, as per institutional clinical protocol. MRI unsafe devices or objects for the purposes of exclusion include but are not limited to certain intracranial aneurysm clips, cardiac pacemaker, and implantable defibrillator devices, metallic heart valve, or coronary artery stents, breast tissue expanders, bio or neurostimulators, pellets and bullets, ocular implants and devices, otologic and cochlear implants. Other devices or metallic objects may be deemed unsafe for MRI at the radiologist's discretion.\n  * Unable to tolerate exam (i.e., secondary to untreatable claustrophobia, positioning constraints/unable to lie prone).\n  * Body weight exceeds that allowable by the MRI table.\n  * Breast biopsy or surgical intervention planned before the test RSI-MRI in this study.\n  * Breast implants (silicone or saline).\n\n    8. Nursing or thinks she may be or is pregnant, as gadolinium contrast-enhanced MRI is unsafe. We will perform a pregnancy test as needed per institutional policy for routine breast MRI. Per institutional clinical protocol, all females of childbearing potential who are uncertain if they are pregnant or think they are pregnant must have a blood test or urine study within 2 weeks prior to the MRI exam to rule out pregnancy. A female of childbearing potential is any woman, regardless of sexual orientation or prior tubal ligation, who:\n  * Has not had a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy OR\n  * Has not been naturally post-menopausal for at least 2 years (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 2 years\n\nRadiologist Reader Participant\n\n-None.",
