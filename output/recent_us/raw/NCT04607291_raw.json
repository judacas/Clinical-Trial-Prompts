    "official_title": "A Phase 1/2 Open-label, First-in-human, Dose Escalation and Expansion Study for the Evaluation of Safety, Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics, and Anti-tumor Activity of SAR444200-based Regimen in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors.",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Cancer diagnosis for participants for Part 1A and Part 1B:\n\n  1. Metastatic and/or unresectable HCC diagnosed by histology and/or cytology, or diagnosed clinically by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) criteria for participants with liver cirrhosis (participants without liver cirrhosis must be diagnosed histologically) OR Other histology/cytology proven advanced and/or metastatic non-HCC solid tumors\n  2. Not amenable to available standard of care: participants must have experienced disease progression on/after standard of care, or no acceptable standard curative or palliative treatments exist (or are no longer effective), according to Investigator judgement, or the participant declines standard of care therapy.\n* Cancer diagnosis for participants for Part 2A:\n\n  1. Metastatic NSCLC with no actionable driver gene mutants (such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)), diagnosed by histology and/or cytology not amenable to available standard of care and must have progressed on/after therapy that included an anti-PD(L)-1 agent with or without platinum-based chemotherapy.\n  2. Progressive disease should be observed during the course of anti-PD(L)-1 therapy or within 12 weeks from the last dose of anti-PD(L)-1 therapy\n* Additional for Part 2A: At least 1 measurable lesion per RECIST 1.1 criteria\n* For all participants:\n\n  1. Positive GPC3 expression on tumor tissue as determined locally or centrally\n  2. Capable of giving signed informed consent\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of ≥2.\n* Predicted life expectancy ≤3 months.\n* For participants with HCC: Child Pugh Class B or C liver score within 14 days of initiation of IMP. Participants with Child Pugh Class B-7 score are allowed for Part 1A.\n* Known active brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases.\n* History of allogenic or solid organ transplant\n* Treatment-related immune-mediated (or immune-related) AEs from immune-modulatory agents (including but not limited to anti-PD1/PD-L1 agents and anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated protein 4 monoclonal antibodies) that caused permanent discontinuation of the agent, or that were Grade 4 in severity\n* Significant cardiovascular disease within 3 months prior to initiation of IMP, uncontrolled arrhythmia requiring medication, or unstable angina.\n* Ongoing AEs caused by any prior anti-cancer therapy >Grade 2\n* Known uncontrolled human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B infection, or known untreated current hepatitis C infection\n* Known second malignancy either progressing or requiring active treatment within the last year.\n* For combination therapy: Ongoing or recent (within 5 years) evidence of significant autoimmune disease that required treatment with systemic immunosuppressive treatments, which may suggest risk for immune-related adverse events\n* Receipt of a live-virus vaccination within 28 days of planned treatment start.\n* For Part 2A, has received prior GPC3 targeted anticancer treatment.\n* Current pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease, or history of interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis that required oral or IV glucocorticoids to assist with management.\n\nNOTE: Other Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.
