Measured or calculated creatinine clearance (GFR can be used in place of creatinine clearance; 24-hour urine collection can be used for more accurate estimate as needed)\n\n  * Creatinine clearance (CrCl) should be calculated per institutional standard\n* Total bilirubin =< 1.5 x ULN OR direct bilirubin =< ULN for participants with total bilirubin levels > 1.5 x ULN (collected within 10 days prior to the start of study treatment)\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT]) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase [SGPT]) =< 2.5 x ULN (collected within 10 days prior to the start of study treatment)\n* International normalized ratio (INR) OR prothrombin time (PT) =< 1.5 x ULN unless participant is receiving anticoagulant therapy, as long as PT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants (collected within 10 days prior to the start of study treatment)\n* Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) =< 1.5 x ULN unless participant is receiving anticoagulant therapy, as long as aPTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants (collected within 10 days prior to the start of study treatment)\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* A WOCBP who has a positive urine pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to enrollment. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required\n* Patients with pure small cell histology will be excluded. Mixed histology including partial neuroendocrine small cell features will be permitted\n* Patients considered to be medically unfit for accelerated (dose dense) MVAC chemotherapy, TURBT or RC (per investigator discretion) will be excluded\n* Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti PD L2 agent or with an agent directed to another stimulatory or co-inhibitory T-cell receptor (e.g., CTLA-4, OX 40, CD137)\n* Has received prior systemic anti-cancer therapy including investigational agents within 4 weeks.

Participants must have recovered from all radiation-related toxicities, not require corticosteroids, and should not have active radiation pneumonitis\n* Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug. Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, a version of varicella/zoster (chicken pox), yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus calmette-guerin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., FluMist) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed\n* Is currently participating in or has participated in a study of an investigational agent or has used an investigational device within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment\n\n  * Note: Participants who have entered the follow-up phase of an investigational study may participate as long as it has been 4 weeks after the last dose of the previous investigational agent\n* Has diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy (in dosing > 10 mg daily of prednisone dose equivalent) or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug\n* Has known additional malignancy that is progressing or has required active systemic treatment within the past 2 years. Note: Participants with basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or any carcinoma in situ that have undergone potentially curative therapy are not excluded.
