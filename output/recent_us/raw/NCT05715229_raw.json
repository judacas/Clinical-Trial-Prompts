    "exclusion_criteria": "* Estimated creatinine clearance < 40 mg/min\n* Active suicidal ideation or severe depression (as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Version IV criteria (DSM-IV)) at the time of enrollment or a PHQ-9 score > 20\n* History of prior suicide attempts\n* PHQ-9 score greater >5 and < 20 without an established mental health provider who verifies stability in their depression\n* Current or prior drug or alcohol abuse within the past 6 months (as defined by the DSM IV)\n* In the opinion of the investigator, the patient requires additional immunosuppressive treatment (other than corticosteroids and brodalumab)\n* Known hypersensitivity or contraindication to brodalumab, corticosteroids or any components of brodalumab\n* Prior treatment with brodalumab\n* Pregnancy, breastfeeding, or use of a nonreliable method of contraception\n\n  * For patients assigned female at birth: lack of willingness to use highly effective methods of birth control during treatment and for at least 4 weeks after the last dose of brodalumab (except if surgically sterile or at least 2 years postmenopausal, with postmenopausal status confirmed by FSH in the postmenopausal range).\n  * Highly effective methods of birth control include: use of hormonal contraceptives that inhibit ovulation, hormone-releasing intrauterine devices, and copper intrauterine devices. Oral contraceptive pills must be supplemented by a barrier method.\n  * Patients planning to become pregnant while enrolled in the study and within 4 weeks after the last dose of brodalumab will not be permitted to enroll\n* Chronic or current severe infection requiring IV therapy\n* Evidence of active hepatitis B, C, or tuberculosis.\n* History of latent tuberculosis infection which is incompletely treated based upon local standard of care or which was never treated\n* History of or active Crohn's disease.\n* Myocardial infarction, unstable angina pectoris or stroke within the past 12 months prior to the first investigational product dose\n* Any concurrent medical condition or electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormality that, in the opinion of the investigator, could cause this study to be detrimental to the subject.\n* Any medical condition or treatment for a condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, might interfere with participation in the study or affect the reliability of clinician assessment or patient self-report\n* Other known clinically significant active medical conditions, such as:\n\n  * Severe cardiovascular disease, including advanced heart failure (American Heart Association Stage D)\n  * Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) greater than 2 times the upper limit of normal or greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal in patients with liver metastases measured on at least two separate occasions\n  * Direct bilirubin greater than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL in patients with or without liver metastases\n  * Bone marrow insufficiency unrelated to the irAE (according to investigator judgment) with White Blood Cell (WBC) <2000/mm3, absolute neutrophil count <1500/ mm3, thrombocytopenia (platelet count) <50,000/mm3, hemoglobin < 8.0 g/dL\n* Plan to proceed with further curative intent treatment for cancer at the time of enrollment despite the presence of irAE\n* Participation in another therapeutic clinical trial and receipt of investigational drugs within 4 weeks before the screening visit\n* Previous diagnosis of an autoimmune disease or administration of immunosuppressants in a time frame that would impede interpretation of brodalumab administration\n* Planned use of immunosuppressive agents other than steroids (including infliximab, vedolizumab, tocilizumab etc.) or administration of such agents within 28 days of trial initiation\n* Administration of live-virus vaccines within 4 weeks before the first dose of brodalumab",
