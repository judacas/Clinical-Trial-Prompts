    "inclusion_criteria": "* Participant should have been on and agree to continue to stay on a stable dose of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) treatment with either a) alpha blocker monotherapy or b) alpha blocker + 5 alpha reductase inhibitor.\n* Participant has an International Prostate Symptom Score total score of ≥ 8\n* Participant has a prostate-specific antigen level < 4 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL), or if ≥ 4 ng/mL but ≤ 10 ng/mL, prostate cancer has been ruled out to the satisfaction of the investigator\n* Participant must have both additional qualifications based on the 3-day Bladder Diary period: a) having an average of ≥ 8 but ≤ 20 micturition episodes per day over the 3-day diary period, and (b) having an average of ≥ 3 urgency episodes per day over the 3-day diary period\n* Participant must have a post void residual volume value of < 100 mL\n* Having at least 2 average nocturia episodes per night based on 3-day Bladder Diary at baseline. Nocturia is defined as waking to pass urine during the main sleep period.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be MALE\nMust have minimum age of 45 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Participant has a history of 24-hour urine volume greater than 3,000 mL\n* Has lower urinary tract pathology that could, in the opinion of the investigator, be responsible for urgency, frequency, or incontinence\n* Has a history of prostate surgery, including minimally invasive transurethral or transrectal procedures, procedural treatments for BPH within 6 months of Screening or has a planned prostate surgery\n* Has a history of urinary retention requiring an intervention (e.g., catheterization) for any reason\n* Has maximum urinary flow (Qmax) < 5.0 mL/second with a minimum voided volume of 125 mL\n* Has a history of or current nocturnal polyuria\n* Has an active or recurrent (> 3 episodes per year) urinary tract infection by clinical symptoms or laboratory criteria (≥ 5 white blood cells/high power field [hpf] with presence of red blood cell [RBC] and/or a positive urine culture, defined as ≥ 10^5 colony forming units (CFU)/mL (i.e., 100 × 10^3 CFU/mL in a single specimen)\n* Has uncontrolled hyperglycemia (defined as fasting blood glucose > 150 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or 8.33 millimoles per liter (mmol/L) or non-fasting blood glucose > 200 mg/dL or 11.1 mmol/L) or, if in the opinion of the investigator, is uncontrolled\n* Has uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure of ≥ 180 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) and/or diastolic blood pressure of ≥ 100 mmHg) or has a resting heart rate (by pulse) > 100 beats per minute (min)\n* Has a history of cerebral vascular accident, transient ischemic attack, unstable angina, myocardial infarction, coronary artery interventions (e.g., coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous coronary interventions [e.g., angioplasty, stent insertion]), or neurovascular interventions (e.g., carotid artery stenting) within 6 months prior to the Screening Visit\n* Has alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase > 2.0 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), or bilirubin (total bilirubin) > 1.5 × ULN (or > 2.0 × ULN if secondary to Gilbert syndrome or pattern consistent with Gilbert syndrome)\n* Has an estimated glomerular filtration rate < 30 mL/min/1.73 meters squared (m^2)\n* Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, laboratory abnormality, or other circumstances that might, in the opinion of the investigator, confound the results of the study, interfere with the participant's ability to comply with the study procedure, or make participation in the study not in the participant's best interest",
