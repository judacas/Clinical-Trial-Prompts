Subject has voluntarily agreed to participate by giving written informed consent in accordance with ICH/GCP guidelines and applicable local regulations.\n2.

If LLN is not defined for a given institution, then ejection fraction must be ≥50 %.\n9. Females of child bearing potential (FCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 72 hours of D1 of IP. NOTE: FCBP unless they are surgically sterile (i.e., have undergone a complete hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation/occlusion, bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral salpingectomy), have a congenital or acquired condition that prevents childbearing or are naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months (see Appendix Section 16.2 for additional details). Documentation of postmenopausal status must be provided. FCBP should use an acceptable method of contraception (see Appendix Section 16.2) to avoid pregnancy during treatment and for 30 days (which exceeds 5 half-lives) after the last dose of IP. FCBP must start using acceptable contraception at least 14 days prior to D1 of IP.\n10. Male subjects with female partners must have azoospermia from a prior vasectomy or underlying medical condition or agree to use an acceptable method of contraception during treatment and for 30 days (which exceeds 5 half-lives) after last dose of SL-279252 (see Appendix Section 16.2). Male subjects of reproductive potential must start using acceptable contraception at least 14 days prior to D1 of treatment with SL-279252 as per Appendix Section 16.2.\n11. All AEs resulting from prior anti-cancer immunotherapy have resolved (NOTE: exceptions include alopecia, vitiligo, and endocrinopathies adequately treated with hormone replacement).\n\n    • Subjects that were discontinued from prior PD-1/L1 therapy due to immune-related adverse events are not eligible\n12. Recovery from toxicities from prior anti-cancer treatments including surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy or any other anti-cancer therapy to baseline or ≤ Grade 1. (NOTE: Low-grade toxicities (e.g., alopecia, ≤ Grade 2 lymphopenia, ≤ Grade 2 hypomagnesemia, ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy) may be allowed at the discretion of the investigator if considered clinically insignificant. Please consult the Sponsor Medical Monitor to discuss these cases).\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "Participants are excluded from the study if any of the following criteria apply:\n\n1. Has received more than two prior checkpoint inhibitor containing treatment regimens (regimen refers to either monotherapy or combination immunotherapies) or has had prior treatment with an OX40 agonist.\n\n   • Prior PD-1/L1 therapy is not required.\n2. Refractory to last PD-1/L1 inhibitor-based therapy which is defined as disease progression within 3 months of treatment initiation.\n\n   • Subjects must have had clinical benefit (stable disease or response) to last PD-1/L1 inhibitor-based therapy for at least three months to be eligible.\n3. Any anti-cancer therapy within the time intervals noted below prior to first dose (D1) of SL-279252.\n\n   Therapy Washout period Chemotherapy 3 weeks Hormonal therapy 3 weeks PD-1/L1 inhibitor and other immunotherapies not otherwise specified 3 weeks Tumor vaccine 4 weeks Cell-based therapy 8 weeks Other mAbs or biologic therapies 3 weeks Major surgery 2 weeks Radiation (except palliative intent which does not require washout) 2 weeks\n4. Concurrent chemotherapy, immunotherapy, biologic or hormonal therapy is prohibited. Concurrent use of hormones for non-cancer related conditions is acceptable.\n5. Use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medication, current or within 14 days of D1 of IP with the following exceptions (i.e., the following are allowed during treatment with or within14 days of D1 of IP):\n\n   * Topical, intranasal, inhaled, ocular, intraarticular corticosteroids\n   * Physiological doses of replacement steroid (e.g., for adrenal insufficiency) provided ≤ 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent\n   * Steroid premedication for hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs; e.g., reaction to IV contrast)\n6. Receipt of live attenuated vaccine within 28 days of D1 of IP.\n7. Active or documented history of autoimmune disease (autoimmune disease does not refer to irAEs; for irAEs see inclusion criteria #11). Exceptions include Type I diabetes, vitiligo, alopecia areata or hypo/hyperthyroidism.\n8. Active pneumonitis (i.e. drug-induced, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, radiation-induced, etc.).\n9. Ongoing or active infection (e.g., no systemic antimicrobial therapy for treatment of infection within 5 days of D1 of IP).\n10. Symptomatic peptic ulcer disease or gastritis, active diverticulitis, other serious gastrointestinal (GI) disease associated with diarrhea within 6 months of D1 of IP.\n11.

Untreated central nervous system (CNS) or leptomeningeal metastases. Subjects with treated CNS metastases must have completed definitive treatment (radiotherapy and/or surgery) > 2 weeks prior to D1 of IP and no longer require steroids.\n13. Women who are breast feeding.\n14. Psychiatric illness/social circumstances that would limit compliance with study requirements and substantially increase the risk of AEs or compromised ability to provide written informed consent.\n15. Another malignancy that requires active therapy and that in the opinion of the investigator and Sponsor would interfere with monitoring of radiologic assessments of response to IP.\n16. Has undergone allogeneic stem cell transplantation or organ transplantation.\n17. Known history or positive test for human immunodeficiency virus, or positive test for hepatitis B (positive for hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]) or hepatitis C virus ([HCV]; if HCV antibody (Ab) test is positive check for HCV ribonucleic acid [RNA]).\n\n    * (NOTE: Hepatitis B virus (HBV): Subjects who are hepatitis B core antibody [HBcAb] positive, but HBsAg negative are eligible for enrollment.
