Male patients with female partners of childbearing potential and women patients of childbearing potential are required to use two forms of acceptable contraception, including 1 barrier method, during their participation in the study and for at least 3 months following last dose. Male patients must also refrain from donating sperm during their participation in the study.\n8. Life expectancy ≥3 months.\n9. Willingness and ability to comply with study and follow-up procedures.\n10.

Pathologically confirmed (histology or cytology) of the following cancer types:\n\n   1. Cohort 1: taxane naïve advanced/metastatic gastric cancer, lung cancer, head and neck cancer, or ovarian cancer;\n   2. Cohort 2: taxane naïve advanced/metastatic breast cancer;\n   3. Cohort 3: taxane naïve advanced/metastatic prostate cancer.\n   4. Cohort 4: advanced/metastatic breast or ovarian cancer patients who have either progressed on a taxane or have developed progressive disease within 6 months of receiving a taxane;\n2. With the exception of Cohort 4 above, taxane naïve patients must not have received taxane or taxane based therapies for their metastatic diseases. Patients who had suboptimal taxane exposure defined as having received less than 2 cycles of taxane or taxane based therapies due to intolerability for their metastatic diseases, patients who have received taxane or taxane based therapies for their neoadjuvant treatment or patients who have received taxane or taxane based therapies for their adjuvant treatment without disease progression during treatment are also considered taxane naïve, as long as they have not received taxane or taxane based therapies to treat the metastatic diseases.\n\nExclusion Criteria - Part A and B\n\n1. Most recent chemotherapy ≤14 days or have residual NCI CTCAE greater than Grade 1 chemotherapy-related side effects, with the exception of alopecia.\n2. Use of any experimental drug ≤28 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is shorter) prior to the first dose of CPO-100. For study drugs for which 5 half-lives is ≤28 days, a minimum of 14 days between termination of the study drug and administration of CPO-100 is required.\n3. Wide field radiotherapy (including therapeutic radioisotopes such as strontium 89 and lutetium 177) administered ≤28 days or limited field radiation for palliation ≤7 days prior to starting study drug or has not recovered from side effects of such therapy.\n4. Major surgical procedures ≤28 days of beginning study drug, or minor surgical procedures ≤7 days. No waiting required following port-a-cath placement.\n5. Previously untreated brain metastases. Patients who have received radiation or surgery for brain metastases are eligible if therapy was completed at least 2 weeks previously and there is no evidence of central nervous system disease progression, and no requirement for chronic corticosteroid therapy.\n6. Leptomeningeal metastases or spinal cord compression due to disease.\n7. Known serious hypersensitivity reactions to docetaxel or life-threatening toxicity due to prior exposure to docetaxel\n8. Pregnant or lactating.\n9. Acute or chronic liver, renal, or pancreatic disease that in the opinion of the investigator would put the patient at unjustified increased risk by participating in this study or could interfere with the interpretation of the study results.\n10.

Any of the following cardiac diseases currently or within the last 6 months:\n\n    * Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <50% as determined by multiple gated acquisition (MUGA) scan or echocardiogram (ECHO)\n    * Corrected QT (QTc) interval >470 ms (average of 3 tracings) on screening electrocardiogram (ECG)\n    * Unstable angina pectoris\n    * Congestive heart failure according to the New York Heart Association (NYHA) ≥ Grade 2)\n    * Acute myocardial infarction\n    * Conduction abnormality not controlled with pacemaker or medication\n    * Significant ventricular or supraventricular arrhythmias. (Patients with chronic rate-controlled atrial fibrillation in the absence of other cardiac abnormalities are eligible.)\n12. Inadequately controlled hypertension (ie, systolic blood pressure (SBP) >180 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) >100 mmHg). Subjects with values above these levels must have their blood pressure (BP) controlled with medication prior to starting treatment.\n13.

Active hepatitis B, or hepatitis C infection.\n\n    * Patients will be tested for hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) at Screening.\n    * Patients with hepatitis B (HepBsAg+) who have controlled infection (serum hepatitis B virus DNA level is below the limit of detection by PCR) may be enrolled into the study. Subjects with controlled infections must undergo periodic monitoring of HBV DNA per treating physician.\n    * Patients with hepatitis C (HCV Ab+) who have controlled infection (undetectable HCV RNA by PCR either spontaneously or in response to a successful prior course of anti-HCV therapy) may be enrolled into the study. Patients with controlled infections must undergo periodic monitoring of HCV RNA per treating physician.\n16. Presence of other active cancers, or history of treatment for invasive cancer ≤3 years. Patients with Stage I cancer who have received definitive local treatment and are considered unlikely to recur are eligible. All patients with previously treated in situ carcinoma (ie, non-invasive) are eligible, as are patients with history of non-melanoma skin cancer.\n17.
