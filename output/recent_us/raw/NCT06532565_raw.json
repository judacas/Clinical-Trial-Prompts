    "inclusion_criteria": "* Men and women >= 18 years of age\n* Patients must have histologically identified chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of hematopoietic neoplasms\n* Treatment naive CLL/SLL; No prior therapy for CLL/SLL, including chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy is allowed\n* Estimated life expectancy of greater than 24 months\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Patients with neutropenic (granulocyte [PMN]s < 500 cells/mm^3) or having received rituximab within 6 months\n* Patients with fever (temperature > 38 degrees Celsius [C]) within 1 week\n* Active infection, recent infection requiring systemic treatment that was completed =< 14 days before starting treatment on the study\n* Patients with known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection\n* History of allergic reactions attributable to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to any component of pneumococcal vaccines\n* Chemotherapy in 4 weeks or received Rituximab or similar anti CD20 monoclonal antibody for non-hematological indications within 6 months\n* Received intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) within 3 months prior to vaccination\n* History of allogenic stem cell transplantation\n* Patients who have received cellular therapy (e.g. CAR-T cells) within 12 months prior to vaccination\n* Patients who have previously received pneumococcal vaccine within the preceding 12 months\n* Absolute lymphocyte count less than 500 cells/mm^3\n* Patient with other severe immune deficiency\n* Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents\n* Active malignancy from which the subject is considered by his or her physician to have a less than 24 month survival expectation. Non-melanoma skin cancer is not an exclusion criterion.\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection and/or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements\n* Concurrent systemic immunosuppressant therapy (e.g., cyclosporine A, tacrolimus, etc., or chronic administration [> 14 days] of > 20 mg/day of prednisone) within 14 days of the first dose of study drug\n* Because of the potential for H2-blockers to modulate antibody response to pneumococcal vaccine, patients must discontinue treatment with H2-blockers (cimetidine, ranitidine, etc.) prior to beginning protocol therapy\n* Unwilling or unable to participate in all required study evaluations and procedures\n* Unable to understand the purpose and risks of the study and to provide a signed and dated informed consent form (ICF) and authorization to use protected health information (in accordance with national and local subject privacy regulations)",
