    "inclusion_criteria": "* Participants who are currently enrolled in an eligible bintrafusp alfa parent study where the primary/main analysis has been completed or after discontinuation of study before primary/main analysis has been completed or after discontinuation of study before primary/main analysis has been completed\n* Participants who are currently on active bintrafusp alfa treatment alone as a monotherapy or following discontinuation of other combination treatment agents in the parent study and without treatment interruption at the time of rollover study enrollment\n* Participants who experienced a confirmed complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) in an eligible parent study, discontinued bintrafusp alfa treatment according to the parent study protocol, and subsequently developed disease progression and are willing to re-start bintrafusp alfa treatment deemed potentially beneficial by the participants' physicians\n* Participants who are.discontinued from bintrafusp alfa treatment in an eligible parent study due to an adverse events (AEs) that was subsequently well controlled or completely resolved after stopping therapy, provided that the parent study protocol permits reinitiation of bintrafusp alfa if a participant discontinued treatment due to toxicity and these participants are willing to re-start bintrafusp alfa treatment deemed potentially beneficial by the participants' physicians. Participants who have had AEs requiring permanent treatment discontinuation, like certain immune-related adverse events (irAEs) or certain bleeding events are excluded from participation in this Rollover study\n* Participants with only SD at the time of discontinuation, the Investigator should confirm that no other reasonable treatment options are available\n* Participants who have completed End of treatment (EoT) assessment of a parent study\n* The investigator confirms that each participant agrees to use appropriate contraception and barriers, if applicable. The contraception, barrier, and pregnancy testing requirements are below:\n* For female participants of childbearing potential or for male participants who have female partners of childbearing potential, the following applies:\n* Participants on active treatment must agree to continue to use highly effective contraception for both male and female participants if the risk of conception exists thus, women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use highly effective contraception as stipulated in national or local guidelines\n* Highly effective contraception must be used 28 days prior to the first study intervention administration, for the duration of study intervention, and at least for 2 months (for female participants) or 4 months (for male participants) after stopping study intervention\n* Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, the treating physician should be informed immediately\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Participants who are pregnant or currently in lactation\n* Participants with known hypersensitivity to any of the study intervention ingredients.\n* Participants reinitiating treatment with bintrafusp alfa at study entry: have received any systemic anticancer therapies/treatments since discontinuing bintrafusp alfa treatment.\n* Participants who has withdrawn consent from the parent study for any reason\n* Any other reason that, in the opinion of the Investigator, precludes the participant from participating in the study",
