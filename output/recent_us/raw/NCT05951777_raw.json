    "exclusion_criteria": "* Systemic treatment for unresectable or metastatic disease for more than three months prior to enrollment\n* Any evidence of distant, solid organ metastases (visceral (liver, lung, brain), bone, extra-abdominal)\n* Any evidence of extensive retroperitoneal lymph node metastases not amenable to resection during gastrectomy\n* Any evidence of small or large bowel obstruction with the exception of gastric outlet obstruction due to primary malignancy\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, the following conditions:\n\n  1. Ongoing or active infection\n  2. Symptomatic congestive heart failure\n  3. Stroke (including transient ischemic attack [TIA]), myocardial infarction (MI), or other ischemic event,) within 3 months before initiation of treatment\n  4. Unstable angina pectoris\n  5.

Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.\n* Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.\n* Prior surgery that would preclude safe diagnostic laparoscopy and port placement\n* Has a known history of active tuberculosis (TB; Bacillus tuberculosis).\n* Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the participant's participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of the participant to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator",
