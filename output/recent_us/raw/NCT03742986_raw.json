For participants with liver metastases, bilirubin must be =< 5 x IULN\n* Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) =< 2 x IULN (within 28 days prior to sub-study randomization). For participants with liver metastases, ALT and AST must be =< 5 x IULN\n* Serum creatinine =< the IULN or calculated creatinine clearance >= 50 mL/min using Cockcroft-Gault formula. This specimen must have been drawn and processed within 28 days prior to sub-study randomization\n* Participants' most recent Zubrod performance status must be 0-1 and be documented within 28 days prior to sub-study randomization\n* Participants must have history and physical exam must be obtained within 28 days prior to sub-study randomization\n* Participants with known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection must be receiving anti-retroviral therapy and have an undetectable viral load at their most recent viral load test within 6 months prior to sub-study randomization\n* Participants must also be offered participation in banking and in the correlative studies for collection and future use of specimens\n* Note: As a part of the OPEN registration process the treating institution's identity is provided in order to ensure that the current (within 365 days) date of institutional review board approval for this study has been entered in the system\n\n  * Participants must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and must sign and give written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines\nHealthy volunteers allowed",

In addition to routine contraceptive methods, \"effective contraception\" also includes heterosexual celibacy and surgery intended to prevent pregnancy (or with a side-effect of pregnancy prevention) defined as a hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral tubal ligation. However, if at any point a previously celibate participant chooses to become heterosexually active during the time period for use of contraceptive measures outlined in the protocol, he/she is responsible for beginning contraceptive measures during the study and 4 months after study completion",
