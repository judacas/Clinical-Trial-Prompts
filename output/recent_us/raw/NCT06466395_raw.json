Evaluation of ECOG is to be performed within 7 days prior to the date of signing study consent\n* A female participant is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant, not breastfeeding, and at least one of the following conditions applies:\n\n  * Not a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) OR\n  * A WOCBP who agrees to follow the contraceptive guidance during the treatment period and for at least (120 days [corresponding to time needed to eliminate any study treatment(s) plus 30 days (a menstruation cycle) for risk of genotoxicity]) after the last dose of study treatment\n* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >= 1500/uL (within 14 days prior to the start of study treatment)\n* Platelets >= 100 000/uL (within 14 days prior to the start of study treatment)\n* Hemoglobin >= 8.0 g/dL or >= 5.6 mmol/L (within 14 days prior to the start of study treatment)\n\n  * Criteria must be met without erythropoietin dependency and without packed red blood cell (pRBC) transfusion within last 2 weeks\n* Creatinine =< 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) OR measured or calculated creatinine clearance (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] can also be used in place of creatinine or creatinine clearance [CrCl]) >= 30 mL/min for participant with creatinine levels > 1.5 x institutional ULN (within 14 days prior to the start of study treatment)\n\n  * Creatinine clearance (CrCl) should be calculated per institutional standard\n* Total bilirubin =< 1.5 x ULN OR direct bilirubin =< ULN for participants with total bilirubin levels > 1.5 x ULN (within 14 days prior to the start of study treatment)\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT]) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT]) =< 2.5 x ULN (=< 5 x ULN for participants with liver metastases) (within 14 days prior to the start of study treatment)\n* International normalized ratio (INR) OR prothrombin time (PT) activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) =< 1.5 x ULN unless participant is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or aPTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants (within 14 days prior to the start of study treatment)\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* A woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) who has a positive urine pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to enrollment. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required. Note: in the event that 72 hours have elapsed between the screening pregnancy test and the first dose of study treatment, another pregnancy test (urine or serum) must be performed and must be negative in order for subject to start receiving study medication\n* Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent or with an agent directed to another stimulatory or co-inhibitory T-cell receptor (e.g., CTLA-4, OX 40, CD137)\n* Has received prior systemic anti-cancer therapy including investigational agents within 2 weeks of study treatment. Note: Participants must have recovered from all adverse events (AEs) due to previous therapies to =< grade 1 or baseline. Participants with =< grade 2 neuropathy may be eligible\n* If participant received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting study treatment\n* Has received prior radiotherapy within 2 weeks of start of study treatment. Participants must have recovered from all radiation-related toxicities, not require corticosteroids, and not have had radiation pneumonitis. A 1-week washout is permitted for palliative radiation (=< 2 weeks of radiotherapy) to non-central nervous system (CNS) disease\n* Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug. Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster (chicken pox), yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., FluMist) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed\n* Is currently participating in or has participated in a study of an investigational agent or has used an investigational device within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment. Note: Participants who have entered the follow-up phase of an investigational study may participate as long as it has been 4 weeks after the last dose of the previous investigational agent\n* Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy (in dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug\n* Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or has required active treatment within the past 1 year. Note: Participants with basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or carcinoma in situ (e.g. breast carcinoma, cervical cancer in situ) or other similar good prognosis cancer with recurrence rates expected to be < 10% that have undergone potentially curative therapy are not excluded\n* Known metastatic sites of disease. Note: locoregional lymph nodes or tumor deposits are not considered metastatic disease\n* Has severe hypersensitivity (>= grade 3) to pembrolizumab and/or any of its excipients\n* Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment\n* Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or has current pneumonitis\n* Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy\n* Has a known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\n* Has a known history of hepatitis B (defined as hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] reactive) or known active hepatitis C virus (defined as HCV ribonucleic acid [RNA] [qualitative] is detected) infection. Note: no testing for hepatitis B and hepatitis C is required unless mandated by local health authority\n* Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the subject's participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator\n* Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial\n* Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the study, starting with the screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment",
