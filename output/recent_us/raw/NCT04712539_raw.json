Adequate Organ Function:\n\n   * Creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL\n   * Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN)\n   * Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 times ULN *\n   * Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or (SGOT) ≤ 2.5 times ULN *\n   * Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 times ULN * *or ≤5x ULN if liver involvement\n8. EKG without clinically relevant abnormalities\n9. Female subjects: Not pregnant or lactating\n10. Patients with child bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception\n11. Study specific informed consent in the native language of the subject.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. high frequency microsatellite instability (MSI-H)\n2. Bowel obstruction or high risk for obstruction if tumors become inflamed\n3.

Bevacizumab (Avastin®) treatment within 6 weeks of baseline scheduled biopsy procedure\n9. Any of the following mood disorders: active major depressive episode, history of suicidal attempt or ideation\n10. Prior allogeneic bone marrow/stem cell or solid organ transplant\n11. Chronic use (> 2 weeks) of greater than physiologic doses of a corticosteroid agent (dose equivalent to > 5 mg/day of prednisone) within 30 days of the first day of study drug treatment\n\n    * Topical corticosteroids are permitted\n12. Prior diagnosis of an active autoimmune disease (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, autoimmune thyroid disease, uveitis).\n\n    * Well controlled Type I diabetes allowed\n13. Prior experimental therapy\n14. History of blood transfusion reactions\n15. Progressive viral or bacterial infection\n\n    * All infections must be resolved and the subject must remain afebrile for seven days without antibiotics prior to being placed on study\n16. Cardiac disease of symptomatic nature\n17. History of HIV positivity or AIDS\n18. Concurrent medication known to interfere with platelet function or coagulation (e.g., aspirin, ibuprofen, clopidogrel, or warfarin) unless such medications can be discontinued for an appropriate time period based on the drug half-life and known activity (e.g., aspirin for 7 days) prior to biopsy procedures\n19. History of severe hypersensitivity to monoclonal antibody drugs\n20. Psychiatric or addictive disorders or other condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude study participation.\n21.
