Patients must have measurable disease that can be accurately measured by RECIST 1.1 criteria in at least one dimension as >= 1.0 cm or > 1.5 cm lymph node with computed tomography (CT), ultrasound, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques.\n\n  * Platinum resistant is defined as progression of disease within six months of platinum regimen.\n  * Patients with BRCA mutations who have completed standard therapies (including PARP inhibitors) are allowed on this study.\n* Patients must be capable of understanding and providing a written informed consent.\n* Patients must be 14 days from previous cytotoxic chemotherapy at time of cell collection.\n* Laboratory values must indicate adequate organ function.\n* Patients must be at least 28 days post systemic steroids prior to enrollment except as premedication for contrast allergy and/or other protocol-mandated medication.\n* Patients must have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of =< 2.\n* Patients must have recovered from major acute infections and/or recent surgical procedures, and in the opinion of the investigator, not have any significant active concurrent medical illnesses precluding protocol treatment.\n* Negative pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential. Women of childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized, are < 60 years old, or have had menses within the past 12 months.\n* Women of childbearing potential must be willing to use 2 methods of contraception before, during, and at least 4 months after the PRGN-3005 cell infusion.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be FEMALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
