    "official_title": "Phase III, Adjudicator-blinded, Randomised Study to Evaluate Efficacy and Safety of Treatment With Olorofim Versus Treatment With AmBisome® Followed by Standard of Care in Patients With Invasive Fungal Disease Caused by Aspergillus Species",
    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Male and female patients ages over 18 years and weighing more than 30 kg\n2. Patients with proven IA at any site or probable LRTD IA per EORTC/MSG 2019 criteria as adapted for this study and where the duration of specific therapy for this episode of IA has been ≤ 28 days. For purposes of this inclusion, the duration of specific therapy includes any mould-active therapy given for this episode of IA whether subsequently judged potentially effective or not.\n3. Patients requiring therapy with an antifungal agent other than a mould-active azole, and who have had ≤ 96 hours of potentially effective prior therapy. Potentially effective prior therapy includes any agent to which the infecting strain of Aspergillus is likely to be susceptible. There are no exclusions or limitations on such agents (eg, AmBisome® is permitted) other than their duration.\n4. AmBisome® is an appropriate therapy for the patient.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.\n2. Known history of allergy, hypersensitivity, or any serious reaction to any component of the study drug\n3. Patients with only chronic aspergillosis, aspergilloma, or allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.\n4. Suspected mucormycosis (zygomycosis).\n5. Patients with a known active second fungal infection of any type, other than candidiasis that can be treated with fluconazole.\n6. The requirement for ongoing use of echinocandin as Candida prophylaxis.\n7. Microbiological findings (eg, bacteriological, virological) or other potential conditions that are temporally related and suggest a different aetiology for the clinical features.\n8. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection but not currently receiving antiretroviral therapy.\n9. Patients with a baseline prolongation of QT using Fridericia's Correction Formula (QTcF) ≥ 500 msec, or at high risk for QT/QTc prolongation.\n10. Evidence of hepatic dysfunction.",
