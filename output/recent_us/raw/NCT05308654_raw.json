    "official_title": "Study of the Efficacy, Safety and Quality of Life After TOOKAD® Soluble Vascular Targeted Photodynamic Therapy (VTP) for Minimally Invasive Treatment of Localized Intermediate Risk Prostate Cancer.",
    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Men over 18 years of age.\n2. Patients who have had a multiparametric MRI of the prostate performed and have undergone transrectal systematic biopsy plus biopsy of any volumes considered suspicious per the MRI (PIRADS version 2 score of 4 or 5) within 6 months before signing consent.\n3. Histologic diagnosis of prostate cancer identifying Gleason score of 3+4 on one half of the prostate gland in no more than 2 sextants of the prostate gland and not present in more than 50% of any one core taken systematically. The involvement criterion does not apply to cores taken from MRI suspicious volumes.\n4. Patients with concomitant Gleason score 3+3 prostate cancer in less than 50% of any core at any site will be considered eligible.\n5. Prostate cancer stage up to cT2a - N0/Nx - M0/Mx.\n6. Prostate volume ≥25 mL and ≤70 mL.\n7. Serum PSA ≤10 ng/mL.\n8. Men who are sexually active with women of childbearing potential must use contraceptive method with a failure rate of less than 1% per year. Contraception should be continued for a period of 90 days after the VTP procedure. The individual methods of contraception may be determined in consultation\n9. Signed Informed Consent Form.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be MALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Unwillingness to accept the treatment;\n2. Any prior or current treatment for prostate cancer, including surgery, radiation therapy (external or brachytherapy) or chemotherapy;\n3. Any surgical intervention for benign prostatic hypertrophy;\n4. Any condition or history of illness or surgery that might pose an additional risk to men undergoing the VTP procedure;\n5. Life expectancy less than 10 years;\n6. Participation in another clinical study involving an investigational product within 1 month before study entry;\n7. Inability to understand the informed consent document, to give consent voluntarily or to complete the study tasks, especially inability to understand and fulfill the health-related QOL questionnaire;\n8. Subjects in custody and or residing in a nursing home or rehabilitation facility;\n9. Biopsy proven locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer.\n10. Any condition or history of illness or surgery that in the opinion of the investigator might affect the conduct and results of the study or pose additional risks to the subject (e.g., cardiac or respiratory disease precluding general anesthesia; anticoagulant treatment which cannot be temporarily withdrawn for the procedure).\n11. Medical conditions that preclude the use of general anesthesia;\n12. Any condition or history of active rectal inflammatory bowel disease or other factors which might increase the risk of fistula formation;\n13. Hormonal manipulation (excluding 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors) that alters androgen production within the previous 6 months;\n14. History of urethral stricture disease;\n15. History of acute urinary retention within 6 months of study entry;\n16. Condition requiring medication with potential photosensitizing effects (tetracyclines, quinolones, sulphonamides, phenothiazines, sulfonylurea hypoglycaemic agents, thiazide diuretics, griseofulvin, and amiodarone) if these treatments could not be stopped at least 10 days before and for 3 days after the VTP procedure or replaced by treatments without photosensitizing properties;\n17. Anticoagulant drugs (e.g., warfarin) that could not be withdrawn during the 10 days prior to the VTP procedure or antiplatelet drugs (e.g. aspirin) that could not be withdrawn during the 10 days prior to the VTP procedure and 3 days after VTP;\n18. Renal and hepatic disorders with values of >1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) or blood disorders (upon clinician judgment);\n19.
