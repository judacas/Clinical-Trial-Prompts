Periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of contraception. Vasectomized (i.e., sterile) males are considered fertile and should still use a male condom plus spermicide as indicated above during the clinical study\n* Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen are eligible for this trial\n* Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients on effective anti-retroviral therapy with undetectable viral load within 6 months of registration are eligible for this trial\n* Patients with evidence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection must have an undetectable HBV viral load on suppressive therapy, if indicated\n\n  * Patients with a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection must have been treated and cured. For patients with HCV infection who are currently on treatment, they are eligible if they have an undetectable HCV viral load\n* Patients with new or progressive brain metastases (active brain metastases) or leptomeningeal disease are eligible if the treating physician determines that immediate central nervous system (CNS) specific treatment is not required and is unlikely to be required during the first cycle of therapy\n\n  * Patients with treated brain metastases are eligible if follow-up brain imaging after CNS-directed therapy shows no evidence of progression\n  * Extra caution should be taken with olaparib, as it crosses the blood brain barrier and can cause edema in brain metastases\n* The patient or a legally authorized representative must provide study-specific informed consent prior to study entry and, for patients treated in the United States (U.S.), authorization permitting release of personal health information\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be FEMALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
