In these situations, treating physicians may submit their patient to the BMT CTN 1904 ERC for review in order to determine if the patient is eligible for this clinical trial based on additional clinical or laboratory information\n  * Many patients with BMFD can have bone marrow evaluations that raise concern for possible myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) including but not limited to dysplastic bone marrow evaluations or cytogenetic abnormalities. However, in patients BMFD these findings are not necessarily diagnostic or consistent with MDS. Therefore, given the complexities of diagnosing MDS in patients with BMFD, all patients with bone marrow evaluations concerning for possible MDS should be submitted to the ERC for review to confirm or exclude MDS. This is particularly important as we do not want to exclude potentially eligible patients due to an incorrect diagnosis of MDS\n* HLA-MATCHED RELATED DONOR: HLA-matched sibling: Must be a minimum HLA-6/6 matched to the recipient at HLA-A, -B (serologic typing) and DRB1 (high-resolution typing)\n* HLA-MATCHED RELATED DONOR: HLA-matched related (phenotypic match): Fully matched for HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, and DQB1 by high-resolution typing.\n* HLA-MATCHED RELATED DONOR: If a genetic mutation is known for the patient, the HLA-matched related donor [either HLA-matched sibling or HLA-matched related (phenotypic match)] must be screened for the same genetic mutation if clinically appropriate and should be confirmed to not have the same genetic disease (this does not include patients with PNH). Consult the protocol team with questions\n* HLA-MATCHED RELATED DONOR: If a patient has an undefined BMFD (a patient with a BMFD for whom a genetic mutation responsible for their bone marrow failure phenotype has not been identified), the HLA-matched related donor [either HLA-matched sibling or HLA-matched related (phenotypic match)] must have an evaluation as directed by the treating physician to confirm that the donor does not have the same underlying disease. This will include a complete blood count (CBC) with differential and potentially a bone marrow evaluation or other studies as directed by the treating physician\n* UNRELATED DONOR: Fully matched for HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, and DQB1 by high-resolution typing OR\n* UNRELATED DONOR: Mismatched for a single HLA-class 1 allele (HLA-A, -B, or -C) by high-resolution typing; OR\n* UNRELATED DONOR: Mismatched for a single HLA DQB1 allele or antigen by high-resolution typing\n\n  * Note: donor patient (DP) matching per institutional practice\n* DONOR SELECTION RECCOMENDATIONS: in the case where there are multiple donor options, donors should be selected based on the following priority numbered below:\n\n  * Unaffected fully HLA-matched sibling\n  * Unaffected fully phenotypically HLA-matched related donor\n  * Fully HLA-matched unrelated donor\n  * Unrelated donor with single allele or antigen level mismatch at DQB1\n  * Unrelated donor with single allele level mismatch at class 1 (HLA-A, -B, or -C)\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 1 Year\nMust have maximum age of 49 Years",
