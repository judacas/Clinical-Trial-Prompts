Adequate coagulation i. International normalized ratio (INR) or prothrombin time (PT) < 1.5 x ULN unless patient is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or INR is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants.\n\n   ii. Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) < 1.5 x ULN unless patient is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as aPTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants.\n\n   e. Adequate cardiac function defined as: i. Shortening fraction of > 27% by echocardiogram, or ii. Ejection fraction of > 50% by radionuclide angiogram or echocardiogram f. Adequate pulmonary function defined as: i. No evidence of dyspnea at rest, no history of exercise intolerance, and a pulse oximetry of > 94%.\n\n   g.

Patient and/or patient's parent or legal guardian must be capable of understanding the investigational nature, potential risks, and benefits of the study. The patient and/or the parent or legal guardian must sign a written informed consent. Age-appropriate assent will be obtained per institutional guidelines.\n\n   Contraception:\n\n   Female patients :\n9. A female patient is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant, not breastfeeding, and at least one of the following conditions applies:\n\n   1. Not a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) as defined in the protocol OR\n   2. A WOCBP who agrees to follow the contraceptive guidance in the protocol during the treatment period and for at least 120 days after the last dose of study treatment.\n10. A female patient of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to receiving any dose of study treatment. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required.\n\n    Male patients:\n11. A male patient is eligible to participate if he agrees to follow the contraceptive guidance in the protocol during the study treatment period and for at least 120 days after the last dose of study treatment.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 12 Years\nMust have maximum age of 39 Years",

Has CNS or any extrapulmonary disease involvement at the time of the most recent episode of disease recurrence proceeding enrollment.\n5. Has active infection requiring systemic therapy or is dependent on or is currently receiving systemic antibiotics that cannot be discontinued before dosing. (Note: Patients who discontinue an antibiotic prior to dosing must wait at least 5 half-lives after the last dose of antibiotic before receiving any OST31-164 infusion). Inhaled prophylactic PJP (pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia) treatment is acceptable per Investigator discretion.\n6.

Has an active autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment within the past 3 months or a documented history of clinically severe autoimmune disease, or a syndrome that requires systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents. Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency) is not considered a form of systemic treatment. Patients with vitiligo or resolved childhood asthma/atopy would be an exception to this rule. Patients who require intermittent use of bronchodilators or local steroid injections will not be excluded from the study. Patients with hypothyroidism stable on hormone replacement or Sjogren's syndrome will not be excluded from the study.\n10. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial.\n11.

Has a known allergy to any component of the study treatment(s) formulations.\n13. Has a contraindication (e.g., sensitivity/allergy) to both trimethoprim/ sulfamethoxazole and amoxicillin.\n14.

Has had a prior monoclonal antibody therapy within 2 weeks prior to study Day 1.\n17. Requires or anticipates requiring tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blocking agent (e.g., infliximab) therapy for diagnosis of rheumatologic disease or inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn's disease, plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, or ulcerative colitis).\n18. Has previous history of listeriosis.\n19. Has a known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).\n20.
