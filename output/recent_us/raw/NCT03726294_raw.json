However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, confirmation with two FSH measurements in the postmenopausal range is required.\n  * Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the non-hormonal highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrollment.\n* Women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP; see definition above), must agree to use a highly effective method of contraception consistently and correctly as described below during study treatment and for 120 days after study discontinuation.\n\n  * 1. Highly Effective Contraceptive Methods That Are User Dependent a (Failure rate of < 1% per year when used consistently and correctly.)\n\n    * a. Combined (estrogen- and progestogen- containing) hormonal contraception b, c\n\n      * i. Oral\n      * ii. Intravaginal\n      * iii. Transdermal\n      * iv. Injectable\n    * b.

Intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS) b\n    * c. Intrauterine device (IUD)\n    * d. Bilateral tubal occlusion\n    * e. Vasectomized partner: A vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraception method provided that the partner is the sole male sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. If not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be used.\n    * f. Sexual abstinence: Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatment. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.\n  * NOTES: Use should be consistent with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for participants of clinical studies.\n\n    * Typical use failure rates are lower than perfect-use failure rates (i.e. when used consistently and correctly).\n    * If hormonal contraception efficacy is potentially decreased due to interaction with study treatment, condoms must be used in addition to the hormonal contraception during the treatment period and for at least during study treatment and for 120 days after study discontinuation after the last dose of study treatment.\n    * If locally required, in accordance with Clinical Trial Facilitation Group (CTFG) guidelines, acceptable contraceptive implants are limited to those which inhibit ovulation.\n* Male participants must agree to use at least one of the following methods of contraception starting with the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of therapy:\n\n  * 1.
