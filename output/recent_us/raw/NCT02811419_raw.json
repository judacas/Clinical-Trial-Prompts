    "exclusion_criteria": "* Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies) and is not on continuous daily immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment; (an exception to this is the use of steroids for brain edema and resulting symptom); subjects may receive a stable or reducing dose of steroids (up to 8 mg dexamethasone or equivalent for at least 5 days prior to signing consent) to prevent or manage cerebral edema; subjects requiring over 8mg of dexamethasone per day on or five days prior to signing consent are excluded)\n* Has a known history of active TB (Bacillus tuberculosis)\n* Hypersensitivity to pembrolizumab or ferumoxytol or any of their excipients\n* Has had a prior anti-cancer monoclonal antibody (mAb) within 4 weeks prior to study day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., =< grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier\n* Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment; exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical cancer\n* Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs); replacement therapy (e.g. thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment\n* Has known history of, or any evidence of active, non-infectious pneumonitis\n* Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy\n* Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator\n* Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial\n* Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment\n* Has known active hepatitis B (e.g., hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] reactive) or hepatitis C (e.g., hepatitis C virus [HCV] ribonucleic acid [RNA] [qualitative] is detected)\n* Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy; Note: Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist) are live attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed\n* Subjects with clinically significant signs of uncal herniation, such as acute pupillary enlargement, rapidly developing motor changes (over hours), or rapidly decreasing level of consciousness, are not eligible\n* Subjects with known allergic or hypersensitivity reactions to parenteral iron, parenteral dextran, parenteral iron-dextran, or parenteral iron-polysaccharide preparations (Ferumoxytol Investigator's Drug Brochure, 2009); subjects with significant drug or other allergies or autoimmune diseases may be enrolled at the investigator's discretion\n* Subjects who have a contraindication for 3T MRI: metal in their bodies (a cardiac pacemaker or other incompatible device), are severely agitated\n* Subjects with known iron overload (genetic hemochromatosis); in subjects with a family history of hemochromatosis, hemochromatosis must be ruled out prior to study entry with normal values of the following blood tests: transferrin saturation (TS) test and serum ferritin (SF) test; all associated costs will be paid by the study\n* Subject who have received ferumoxytol within 3 weeks of study entry\n* Subjects with three or more drug allergies from separate drug classes",
