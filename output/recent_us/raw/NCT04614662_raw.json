    "official_title": "A Phase 1 Trial of Menin-inhibitor Ziftomenib in Combination With Chemotherapy for Children With Relapsed/Refractory KMT2A-r/NUP98-r/NPM1-m Acute Leukemia",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Age: 0-21 years (and at least 5 kg body weight), with a minimum of 80% of participants under 18 years of age.\n* Diagnosis: KMT2A-r, NPM1-m, or NUP98-r acute leukemia in first or greater relapse or refractory to standard (re-) induction treatment (including HSCT). Please note that genetic alteration must be confirmed by the central laboratory, or the participant will discontinue protocol therapy.\n* Eligible participants also must fulfill one of the following conditions:\n\n  1. Bone marrow relapse is defined as:\n\n     1. A single bone marrow sample showing ≥ 5% leukemic blasts by flow cytometry, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) testing, or other molecular method.\n\n        * a single bone marrow sample with at least two tests showing ≥ 1% leukemic blasts, examples of tests (confirmed by central lab) include: Flow cytometry showing leukemia ≥ 1% by multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) confirmed by central lab.\n        * Karyotypic abnormality as confirmed by central cytogenetic review.\n        * FISH abnormality identical to one present at diagnosis (must be above level of sensitivity of specific FISH probe; central cytogenetic review required).\n        * Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or next generation sequencing (NGS)-based demonstration of validated leukemogenic lesion (e.g., fusion, mutation) in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-approved laboratory that matches initial diagnosis and is quantifiable as ≥1% confirmed by central lab.\n     2. Participants with combined extramedullary and bone marrow relapse (defined as above) are eligible.\n     3. Participants with isolated extramedullary disease (EMD) are not eligible. EMD relapse is defined as biopsy-proven extramedullary disease without bone marrow disease after documented complete response (CR) following initial therapy. Participants with isolated central nervous system (CNS) relapse are not eligible. Participants with a combined medullary/extramedullary relapse, including CNS disease, are eligible.\n     4. Participants with asymptomatic CNS3 disease are eligible if they do not have isolated CNS3 extramedullary relapse.\n     5. For participants unable to undergo bone marrow assessment, a peripheral blood absolute blast count ≥ 1,000 cell/microliter is sufficient to diagnose relapsed or refractory disease and facilitate confirmation of required genetic alterations for protocol therapy.\n  2. Refractory disease/induction failure:\n\n     1. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML): The bone marrow contains ≥ 1% leukemic blasts by MFC at the end of 2 cycles of induction therapy.\n     2. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)/mixed-phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL)/acute undifferentiated leukemia (AUL): The bone marrow contains ≥ 1% leukemic blasts by MFC at the end of induction and consolidation, or persistent MRD prior HSCT (defined as > 0.01%).\n     3. For participants unable to have bone marrow assessed, a peripheral blood absolute blast count ≥ 1,000 cell/microliter is sufficient to diagnose relapsed or refractory disease.\n  3.

Participants who are unable to walk because of paralysis, but who are up in a wheelchair, will be considered ambulatory for the purpose of assessing the performance score.\n* Adequate organ function:\n\n  1. Renal function defined as: Creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥60 mL/min (as measured by a nuclear glomerular filtration rate [GFR] scan or calculated by the Schwartz formula and normalized to a body surface area of 1.73 m^2).\n  2. Liver function defined as:\n\n     1. Direct bilirubin < 3 x upper limit of normal (ULN) and Serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) (alanine transaminase [ALT]) ≤ 5 x ULN.\n     2. If liver abnormality is due to radiographically identifiable leukemia infiltrate, the participant will remain eligible.\n  3. Cardiac function defined as: Pre-treatment left ventricular function on echocardiography: Fractional shortening (FS) ≥ 25% or ejection fraction (EF) ≥ 40%, and no signs of congestive heart failure within 4 weeks before start of screening.\n* Prior therapy: Participants must have recovered from the acute toxic effects of all prior anti-cancer therapy (excluding Grade 2 toxicities that are not considered a safety risk or medically significant toxicity deemed irreversible by the Investigator) and must meet the following minimum duration from prior anti-cancer directed therapy prior to enrollment.\n\n  1. Cytotoxic chemotherapy: Must not have received within 14 days or within 5 drug half-lives (whichever is longer), of entry onto this study, except for hydroxyurea or corticosteroids. Use of steroids and hydroxyurea for other purposes such as differentiation syndrome, or to premedication to prevent allergic reaction or during anesthesia is allowed.\n  2. Intrathecal cytotoxic therapy: No washout or waiting period is required for participants having received any combination of intrathecal cytarabine, methotrexate, and/or hydrocortisone.\n  3. Antibodies: ≥ 21 days must have elapsed from infusion of last dose of an antibody-drug conjugate. For unmodified antibodies or T cell engaging antibodies, 2 half-lives must have elapsed before enrollment. Any toxicity related to prior antibody therapy must be recovered back to baseline.\n  4. Interleukins, interferons and cytokines (other than hematopoietic growth factors): ≥ 21 days after the completion of interleukins, interferon or cytokines (other than hematopoietic growth factors).\n  5. Hematopoietic growth factors: ≥ 14 days after the last dose of a long-acting growth factor (e.g., peg-filgrastim) or 7 days for short-acting growth factor.\n  6. Radiation therapy (RT): 14 days have elapsed for local palliative RT (small port); ≥ 84 days must have elapsed if prior craniospinal RT or if ≥ 50% radiation of pelvis; ≥ 42 days must have elapsed if other substantial bone marrow (BM) radiation.\n  7. Stem cell infusions:\n\n     1.
