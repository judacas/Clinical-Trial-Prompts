    "inclusion_criteria": "Key Inclusion Criteria for Parts 1 and 2:\n\n* Histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic or unresectable solid tumor.\n* Measurable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) as assessed by the Investigator.\n* Have progressed on or after all prior standard-of-care therapies for metastatic disease.\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤1.\n* Adequate organ and marrow function as defined in the protocol.\n\nAdditional Key Inclusion Criteria for Part 2:\n\n* Participants with squamous non-small cell lung cancer (sqNSCLC) with or without nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2 [NFE2L2]) and/or cullin 3 (CUL3) mutations.\n* Participants with advanced sqNSCLC must be refractory to or have progressed on or after a platinum-based doublet regimen and an immune checkpoint inhibitor.\n* Participants with advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) must have received prior treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy, an immune checkpoint inhibitor (for tumors with known programmed death-ligand 1 [PD-L1] expression, microsatellite instability-high, or mismatch repair deficiency, and an anti-epidermal growth factor receptor agent) (Combination Expansion Cohort).\n* Participants with advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) must have received prior treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy, an immune checkpoint inhibitor (for tumors with known PD-L1 expression) (Combination Expansion Cohort).\n* Participants with a known driver mutation, including activating epidermal growth factor receptor mutations or anaplastic lymphoma kinase rearrangements, should have progressed after appropriate targeted treatment.\n* Participants with known human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 overexpression should have progressed after appropriate targeted treatment.\n\nKey Exclusion Criteria for Parts 1 and 2:\n\n* Participant is known to have a mutation that has no expectation of benefit from VVD-130037. Current such mutations include the following:\n\n  1. KEAP1 nonsense mutation (any position)\n  2. KEAP1 frameshift mutation (any position)\n* Any unresolved toxicity Grade ≥2 per CTCAE version 5.0 from previous anticancer treatment.\n* Current or prior treatment with anti-epileptic medications for the treatment or prophylaxis of seizures.\n* History of seizure or condition that may predispose to seizure.\n* History or presence of central nervous system (CNS) metastases or spinal cord compression.\n* Uncontrolled arterial hypertension despite optimal medical management.\n* Risk factors for abnormal heart rhythm/QT prolongation as defined in the protocol.\n* History of the following cardiac diseases:\n\n  i) congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] Class >II), ii) unstable angina, iii) new onset angina within past 6 months, iv) myocardial Infarction within the past 6 months, v) clinically significant arrhythmias within past 6 months.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
