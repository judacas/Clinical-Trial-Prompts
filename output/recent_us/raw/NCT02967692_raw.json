Peripheral neuropathy must be Grade 2 or less. Chronic but stable toxicities Grade > 1 (eg, dysphasia, G tube dependence, etc.) are permissible.\n* 7.Age ≥ 18\n* 8.Absolute neutrophil count > 1500/µL (stable off any growth factor for at least 1 week of study drug administration)\n* 9.Hemoglobin > 9g/dL (transfusion to achieve this level is permitted)\n* 10.Platelet count > 75 x 103/ µL (transfusion to achieve this level is NOT permitted)\n* 11.Serum aspartate transaminase (AST) and serum alanine transaminase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) .Total serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN\n* 12.Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN or creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min as calculated per Cockcroft Gault equation\n* 13.Urinary protein < 2+ by dipstick. If dipstick ≥ 2+, then a 24 hour urine collection can be done and the subject may enter only if urinary protein is < 1 g/24 hour\n* 14.Sexually active subjects must agree to utilize birth control method during treatment and for 18 weeks after the last dose of VK 2019.\n* 15.Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 2 or less.\n* 16.Ability to understand and the willingness to personally sign the written IRB approved informed consent document.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* 1.Prior therapy restrictions.\n* 2.Concurrent treatment with systemic cancer directed therapy including complementary, alternative, herbal or nutritional supplement based treatments whose purpose is for anti cancer effect\n* 3.Severe or active symptomatic cardiopulmonary diseases, including unstable angina, congestive heart failure, or peripheral vascular disease within 12 months prior to study drug administration; and/or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation or other respiratory illness requiring hospitalization within 4 weeks prior to study drug administration.

Subjects with cranial nerve or base of skull involvement without the above are eligible. Subjects with CNS metastases that are stable on imaging at least 1 month following focal treatment with radiation are eligible\n* 5.Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) unless the HIV positive subjects has:\n\n  1.
