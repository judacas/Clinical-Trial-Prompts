Women of childbearing potential includes pre-menarchal girls with evidence of puberty onset, and adult women through the end of the first 2 years of the onset of menopause. Testing should be completed ≤ 7 days prior to Day 1 of study.\n* Fertile men and women of childbearing potential must agree to use an effective method of birth control from Day 1 of study and for 5 months after last dose of nivolumab or for 8 weeks after last dose of regorafenib, whichever is longer.\n* Effective methods of birth control include: surgical sterility (subject or subject's partner), barrier device (condom, diaphragm), contraceptive coil (IUD), abstinence, or oral contraception.\n* Patients with central nervous system (CNS) disease are eligible if they have received prior radiotherapy or surgery to sites of CNS metastatic disease and are without evidence of progression for at least 4 weeks after CNS therapy.\n\nPatients >18 years must be willing to undergo tumor biopsy at study entry and post-treatment biopsy for biologic correlates. If biopsy is contra-indicated, enrollment must be approved by study PI and archival tissue must be available.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 5 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Patients with prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment has the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen in this trial.\n* Patients with severe and/or uncontrolled concurrent medical disease that in the opinion of the investigator could cause unacceptable safety risks or compromise compliance with the protocol\n* Major surgery (thoracotomy or laparotomy, etc.), laparoscopic biopsy, or significant traumatic injury within 28 days prior to Day 1 of study or who have not recovered adequately from prior surgery\n* Women who are pregnant or nursing/breastfeeding.\n* Known hypersensitivity to excipients of the formulations of regorafenib or nivolumab or similar agents\n* Inability to comply with protocol required procedures\n* Prior therapy with an immune checkpoint inhibitor or a tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting VEGF\n* Patients with autoimmune disease.\n* Chronic use of immunosuppressive therapies\n* Received any investigational drug within 28 days of study enrollment\n* Uncontrolled infection\n* Known active HIV.
