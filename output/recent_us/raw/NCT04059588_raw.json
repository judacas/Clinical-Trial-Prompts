Patients can have any PTEN mutation or deletion status, but MUST have PTEN loss by IHC\n\n  * NOTE: For patients entering the study, all patients must have PTEN IHC performed as described in the MATCH Master Protocol. This includes patients entering the study via the outside assay process\n* Patients must not have co-existing aberrations in the MAPK or PI3K/MTOR pathways as determined by the MATCH screening assessment in NRAS, HRAS, KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, AKT or mTOR\n* Patients must have an electrocardiogram (ECG) within 8 weeks prior to treatment assignment and must have no clinically important abnormalities in rhythm, conduction or morphology of resting ECG (e.g. complete left bundle branch block, third degree heart block)\n* Patients must not have known hypersensitivity to copanlisib or compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition\n* Patients must not have had prior treatment with copanlisib or other PI3K inhibitors, AKT inhibitors or mTOR inhibitors\n* Patients must not be on strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 within two weeks prior to start of study treatment and for the duration of study treatment\n* Patients should stop using herbal medications at least 7 days prior to the first dose of copanlisib. Herbal medications include, but are not limited to: St. John's Wort, Kava, ephedra, gingko biloba, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), yohimbe, saw palmetto, black cohosh and ginseng\n* Patients with type I or II diabetes mellitus must have a hemoglobulin (Hb) A1c ≤ 8.5% within 28 days from registration\n* Patients must not have uncontrolled hypertension defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) greater than 160 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (BP) greater than 100 mmHg or use of more than 2 anti-hypertensive medications\n* Patients must not have HER2 positive (3+ by IHC or fluorescence in situ hybridization [FISH] ratio ≥ 2) breast cancer\n* Patients must not have indolent NHL (Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma) or DLBCL (diffuse large B cell lymphoma) because other studies are ongoing with this agent in this group patients\n* Patients must not be on anti-arrhythmic therapy other than digoxin or beta-blockers\n* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 10^9 /L\n* Platelets ≥ 100x10^9 /L\n* Hemoglobulin (Hgb) > 9 g/dl\n* Total serum bilirubin < 2.0 mg/dL\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (ALT) and Alanine aminotransferase (AST) < 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) (< 5 x ULN in patients with liver metastases)\n* Serum creatinine < 1.5 x ULN\n* Patients with non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture are not eligible\n* Patients with history of or current interstitial pneumonitis are not eligible. NOTE: For solid tumors, CMV PCR can be obtained at the discretion of treating physician or local institutional guidelines\n* Patients must agree not to conceive or father children by agreeing to use contraception while receiving study treatment and for 1 month after the last dose of copanlisib\nHealthy volunteers allowed",
