Primary, histologically confirmed facial isSCC lesion suitable for excision with a minimum diameter of 0.5 cm and with a maximum diameter of 2.0 cm.\n3. Histological diagnosis of a qualified isSCC skin lesion (evidenced by a confirmatory histopathology report) made no more than 6 months prior to the screening visit.\n4. No other dermatological disease in the isSCC target lesion or surrounding area, which in the opinion of the investigator, could interfere with the study.\n5. Willing to refrain from using non-approved lotions or creams on the target lesion and surrounding area during the treatment period (sunscreen and moisturizers allowed).\n6. Willing to refrain from exposure to excessive direct sunlight or ultraviolet light and to avoid the use of tanning parlors for the duration of the study.\n7.

Ability to follow study instructions and likely to complete all study requirements.\n9. Written informed consent obtained, including consent for tissue to be examined and stored by the Central Histology Lab.\n10. Written consent to allow photographs of the target isSCC lesion to be used as part of the study data and documentation.\n11. For female subjects of childbearing potential, a negative pregnancy test at screening and using an acceptable form of birth control (oral / implantable / injectable / transdermal contraceptives, intrauterine device, condom, diaphragm, abstinence, or a monogamous relationship with a partner who has had a vasectomy at least 6 months prior to screening).\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA\n\n1. Pregnant, lactating, or planning to become pregnant.\n2. Presence of known or suspected systemic cancer.\n3.

History of recurrence of the target isSCC lesion.\n5. Concurrent disease or treatment that suppresses the immune system.\n6. Subjects with baseline QT corrected interval QTc > 480 msec using Fridericia's formula.\n7. Chronic medical condition that in the judgment of the investigator(s) would interfere with the performance of the study or would place the patient at undue risk.\n8. Known sensitivity to any of the ingredients in the study medication including an allergy to trehalose.\n9. Use of a tanning bed or other excessive or prolonged exposure to ultraviolet light or direct sunlight during the study.\n10. Treatment with systemic chemotherapeutic agents within the 6 months prior to the screening visit.\n11. Use of systemic retinoids within the 6 months prior to the screening period.\n12. Treatment with systemic immunomodulators or immunosuppressants within the 6 months prior to the screening period.\n13. Use of topical immunomodulators within 2 cm of the target isSCC lesion within the 4 weeks prior to the screening period.\n14. Treatment with the following topical agents within 2 cm of the target isSCC lesion within the 4 weeks prior to the screening visit: aminolevulinic acid, 5-fluorouracil, corticosteroids, retinoids, diclofenac, ingenol mebutate, tirbanibulin, or imiquimod.\n15. Treatment with liquid nitrogen, surgical excision, or curettage within 2 cm of the target isSCC lesion during the 4 weeks prior to the screening visit.\n16. Evidence of current chronic alcohol or drug abuse that, in the opinion of the investigator, would impair the subject's ability to comply with study schedule.\n17. Current enrollment in an investigational drug or device study or participation in such a study within 4 weeks of the screening visit.\n18. In the investigator's opinion, evidence of unwillingness, or inability to follow the restrictions and requirements of the protocol and complete the study.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
