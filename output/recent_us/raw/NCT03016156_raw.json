Has any clinically significant medical disorder, condition, disease (including active or potentially recurrent dermatological conditions other than AD or HS), significant physical examination or laboratory findings that may interfere with study objectives, in the Investigator's opinion (eg, conditions or findings that may expose a patient to unacceptable risk by study participation, confound the evaluation of treatment response or adverse events, or otherwise interfere with a patient's ability to complete the study).\n2. Has an active systemic or soft tissue infection, including known actively-infected AD or HS skin lesion.\n3. Treatment with an investigational product within 30 days or 5 half-lives preceding the first dose of investigational product (whichever is longer).\n4.
