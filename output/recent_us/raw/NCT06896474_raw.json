Evidence of progression within 6 months prior to screening according to one of the following:\n\n   (i) Radiographic disease progression in soft tissue based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours Version 1.1 criteria with or without PSA progression as per Prostate Cancer Working Group Criteria 3 (PCWG3) (ii) Radiographic disease progression in bone defined as the appearance of 2 or more new bone lesions on bone scan as per Prostate Cancer Working Group Criteria 3 (PCWG3).\n\n   (iii) Evidence of disease progression in bone according to PSMA PET scan results in tandem with PSA progression according to PCWG3 criteria.\"\n3.

For participants with pathogenic mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2, they must also have received a PARP-inhibitor or be intolerant of this therapy. For participants with non-BRCA HRR deficiency disease, treatment with a PARP-inhibitor is at the discretion of the Investigator based on a risk/benefit analysis and discussion with the participant.\n5.

Fresh baseline and on-treatment biopsies are required unless these are deemed medically unfeasible. If the participant is unable to undergo fresh biopsy, an archival tumour sample will be required (age of biopsy cannot be greater than 10 years).\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be MALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 130 Years",
