    "inclusion_criteria": "Healthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Ampullary cancer was excluded\n* Significant acute or chronic infections\n* Active autoimmune disease that might deteriorate when receiving an immunostimulatory agent\n* Interstitial lung disease or its history\n* Participants who were not eligible for or have not been treated with 1L systemic chemotherapy\n* Anticancer treatment within 21 days before the start of study intervention\n* Concurrent treatment with nonpermitted drugs\n* Prior participation in a M7824 clinical trial\n* Prior therapy with other immunotherapy or checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti-PD 1, anti PD L1, anti- cytotoxic T-cell lymphocyte-4 (CTLA-4) antibodies.\n* Pregnancy or breast feeding\n* Systemic anticancer treatment after failing 1L platinum-based chemotherapy\n* Other protocol defined exclusion criteria could apply",
    "miscellaneous_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria\n\n* Are participants with histologically or cytologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic BTC.\n* Availability of tumor (primary or metastatic) archival material or fresh biopsies is mandatory\n* Participants with BTC must have failed or be intolerant to 1L systemic platinum-based chemotherapy administered for locally advanced or metastatic disease. Only one prior treatment line is allowed\n* Disease must be measurable with at least 1 unidimensionally measurable lesion by RECIST 1.1\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS) of 0 to 1\n* Life expectancy >= 12 weeks as judged by the Investigator\n* Adequate hematological function defined by white blood cell (WBC) count >= 3 * 10^9/Litre with absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >= 1.5 * 109/Litre, lymphocyte count >= 0.5 * 10^9/Litre, platelet count >=75 * 10^9/Litre, and hemoglobin (Hgb) >= 9 grams/decilitre\n* Adequate hepatic function defined by a total bilirubin level =< 1.5 * upper limit of normal (ULN), an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level =< 2.5 * ULN, and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level =<2.5 * ULN. For participants with liver involvement in their tumor, AST =< 5.0 * ULN and ALT =< 5.0 * ULN is acceptable\n* Adequate coagulation function defined as prothrombin time (PT) or international normalized ratio (INR) =< 1.5 * ULN unless the participant is receiving anticoagulant therapy\n* Albumin >= 3.0 grams/decilitre\n* Hepatitis B virus (HBV) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) positive participants must be treated and on a stable dose of antivirals\n* Adequate renal function defined by either creatinine =< 1.5 * ULN or an estimated creatinine clearance (CCr) > 40 milliliter (mL) per minute (min) according to the Cockcroft-Gault formula or by measure of CCr from 24-hour urine collection\n* Other protocol defined inclusion criteria could apply"
