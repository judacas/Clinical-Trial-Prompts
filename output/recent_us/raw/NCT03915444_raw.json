    "inclusion_criteria": "* Signed informed consent form (ICF)\n* Previously untreated patients (except for one prior cycle of CHOP+R) with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) as determined by local pathology. World Health Organization (WHO) histologies will include:\n\n  * Double hit lymphoma (DHL) or triple hit lymphoma (THL) confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) testing by local pathology (defined as MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements)\n  * High grade B-cell lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements\n  * Double expressor lymphoma (DEL) defined as overexpression of MYC(> or = to 40%) and BCL2 (> or = to 50%) identified by immunohistochemistry (IHC)\n  * High grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBL) NOS subtype\n* Availability of archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks or 15 unstained slides serial sections (3-5 um in thickness) prior to study enrollment. The pathology report must be available for review and a tissue block sent for retrospective central confirmation of diagnosis. If central confirmation is unable to be performed on submitted material, stained slides used for diagnosis and/or additional tumor tissue specimens may also be requested\n\n  * For clarification: Only availability of tumor sample must be verified prior to C1D1 however treatment can commence prior to completion of central review. The adequacy of the tissue will be confirmed if possible (ie. if it will not delay treatment).\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1, or 2\n* Life expectancy of at least 24 weeks\n* At least one bi-dimensionally measurable lesion > 1.5 cm in its longest dimension as measured by CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\n* Ability and willingness to comply with the study protocol procedures\n* Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) >= 45% on cardiac multiple-gated acquisition (MUGA) scan or cardiac echocardiogram (ECHO)\n* Hemoglobin >= 8.0 g/dL without packed RBC transfusion during 14 days before first treatment (unless due to underlying disease, as established by extensive bone marrow involvement or due to hypersplenism secondary to the involvement of the spleen by DLBCL per the investigator)\n* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >= 1,000/uL (unless due to underlying disease, as established by extensive bone marrow involvement or due to hypersplenism secondary to the involvement of the spleen by DLBCL per the investigator)\n* Platelet count >= 75,000/uL (unless due to underlying disease, as established by extensive bone marrow involvement or due to hypersplenism secondary to the involvement of the spleen by DLBCL per the investigator)\n* For women of childbearing potential: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive methods that result in a failure rate of < 1% per year during the treatment period and for at least 12 months after the last dose of study treatment\n\n  * A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is post-menarcheal, has not reached a postmenopausal state (>= 12 continuous months of amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone surgical sterilization (removal of ovaries and/or uterus)\n  * Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of < 1% per year include bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, hormonal contraceptives that inhibit ovulation, hormone-releasing intrauterine devices, and copper intrauterine devices\n  * Women must refrain from donating eggs during the same period\n  * The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception\n* For women of childbearing potential, a negative serum pregnancy test result within 7 days prior to commencement of dosing. Women who are considered not to be of childbearing potential are not required to have a pregnancy test\n* For men: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use a condom, and agreement to refrain from donating sperm, as defined below:\n\n  * With female partners of childbearing potential or pregnant female partners, men must remain abstinent or use a condom during the treatment period and for at least 5 months after the last dose of polatuzumab vedotin, 3 months after the last dose of rituximab, and for at least 6 months after the last dose of cyclophosphamide to avoid exposing the embryo for the duration of the pregnancy. Men must refrain from donating sperm during this same period\n* Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. Male patients considering preservation of fertility should bank sperm before study treatment\n* CRITERIA FOR TISSUE SUBMISSION:\n* Eligible patients must have available at the study site a representative formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor specimen that enabled the definitive diagnosis of DLBCL\n\n  * The specimen must contain adequate evaluable tumor cells (>= 20% for excisional biopsy and >= 50% if sample is a core biopsy) to enable relevant biomarker analysis\n  * A tissue block (preferred) or 15 serial, freshly cut, unstained slides plus punch biopsy of the tissue block accompanied by an associated pathology report will be requested. Punch biopsy is required only with the slide submission. Cytological or fine-needle aspiration samples are not acceptable\n  * If the archival tissue is unavailable or insufficient on the basis of the above criteria, the patient may still be eligible if the patient is willing to provide tissue from a pretreatment core or excisional/incisional biopsy of the tumor. Cytological or fine-needle aspiration samples are not acceptable. The sample should be shipped according to instructions provided in the laboratory manual. Tissue collected on study will not be returned to sites. If needed, additional slides from previously collected samples may be requested. Cases received from each of the participating institutes should be histological confirmed according to the 2016 WHO classification of tumors of hematopoietic and lymphoid neoplasm. The evaluation process by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) requires the possession of representative amount of tissues in a paraffin embedded block to be sent to the primary testing institution (Karmanos Cancer Center, Detroit, Michigan). Shipped slides should be placed in proper containers to avoid breakage during shipping. Blocks of paraffin embedded tissue or slides should be sent with a tracking number the address. In addition, the participation institution should call the laboratory at 313-576-8351 (Julie Boerner) for any sample that they ship and provide tracking number\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
