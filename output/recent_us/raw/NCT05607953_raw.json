    "official_title": "A Randomized, Placebo-controlled, Parallel Phase 2a Dose-ranging Study to Investigate the Efficacy, Safety, and Tolerability of Topical HT-001 for the Treatment of Skin Toxicities Associated With Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Inhibitors",
    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Adult patient (ie, ≥ 18 years of age at Screening/Baseline [V1]) prescribed an approved EGFRI to treat cancer (indication within the approved labeling for the EGFRI).\n2. Patient has developed a rash or symptoms of a rash (papular and/or pustular eruptions) or symptoms of a rash (cutaneous burning), as assessed by both Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grading and ARIGA scales (severity\n\n   ≤ 3) with overall involvement ≤ 30% BSA.\n3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 2.\n4. Predicted life expectancy ≥ 3 months.\n5. Patient is able and willing to comply with contraceptive requirements.\n6. Patient must have the ability and willingness to attend the necessary visits (telehealth and in person).\n7. Patient must be willing and able to provide written informed consent after the nature of the study has been explained and prior to the commencement of any study procedures.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Patient has severe cutaneous toxicity (severity = 4 on the CTCAE grading and ARIGA scales) or cutaneous toxicity involvement that is > 30% BSA, or other severe systemic toxicity (severity > 3 on the CTCAE v5.0 scale) as a result of EGFRI therapy.\n2. Patient has any underlying physical or psychological medical condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would make it unlikely that the patient would comply with the protocol or complete the study per protocol.\n3. Patient has a history of other skin disorders (eg, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, recurrent skin infections), or history of illness that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would confound results of the study or pose unwarranted risk in administering study drug to the patient.\n4. Patient has abnormal laboratory values at Screening/Baseline (V1):\n\n   1. Absolute neutrophil count < 1000/mm3 and WBC count < 3000/mm3\n   2. Platelet count < 50,000/mm3\n   3. Aspartate transaminase (AST) > 2.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN)\n   4. Alanine transaminase (ALT) > 2.5 × ULN\n   5. Bilirubin > 1.5 × ULN\n   6. Creatinine > 1.5 × ULN\n5. Patient has a prescribed cancer treatment plan that requires radiation treatment to the head, neck, or upper trunk concurrent with EGFRI therapy or has previously received radiation therapy within 4 weeks prior to Screening/Baseline (V1).\n6. Patient has received aprepitant or other neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist within 4 weeks prior to Screening/Baseline (V1).\n7. Patient has had prior treatment with an investigational drug within 4 weeks prior to Screening/Baseline (V1), or at least 8 half-lives of the drug, whichever is longer.\n8. Patient has an active infection (eg, pneumonia) or any uncontrolled disease except for the malignancy that, in the opinion of the Investigator, might confound the result or the study or pose unwarranted risk in administering the study drug to the patient.\n9. Patient has received non-stable escalating doses of topical antibiotics, topical steroids, or other topical treatments within 14 days prior to Screening/Baseline (V1). Patients who have been on stable doses of topical antibiotics, topical steroids, or other topical treatments for 14 days or more are allowed to be enrolled and to stay on their current prescription. Reduction in dose due to improvement in EGFRI-related toxicities is allowed.\n10. Patient has used non-stable escalating doses of systemic steroids within 14 days prior to Screening/Baseline (V1) excluding low-dose systemic corticosteroids as part of standard of care for prevention or treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting; acceptability of the steroid and dose is to be determined by the study Investigator. Patients who have been on a stable dose of systemic steroids for 14 days or more are allowed to be enrolled and to stay on their current prescription. Reduction in dose due to improvement in EGFRI-related toxicities is allowed. Use of steroid inhalers and nasal corticosteroids is allowed.\n11. Patient has received non-stable escalating dose treatment with a systemic antibiotic within 14 days prior to Screening/Baseline (V1). Patients who have been on stable doses of systemic antibiotics for 14 days or more are allowed to be enrolled and to stay on their current prescription. Reduction in dose due to improvement in EGFRI-related toxicities is allowed.\n12. Patient has received concomitant treatment with pimozide, moderate to strong cytochrome p450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitors (diltiazem, ketoconazole, itraconazole, nefazodone, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, nelfinavir), or strong CYP3A4 inducers (rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin) within 30 days of Screening/Baseline (V1).\n13. Patient has a history of hypersensitivity to aprepitant or any component of HT-001.\n14. Patient is pregnant or lactating at Screening/Baseline (V1) or planning to become pregnant (self or partner) at any time during the study, including the follow-up period.",
