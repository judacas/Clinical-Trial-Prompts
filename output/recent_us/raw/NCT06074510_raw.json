Chronic kidney disease, as defined by glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 30/mL/min/1.73m2, due to the risk of decreased drug excretion.\n6. Liver dysfunction, as defined by the following laboratory values, due to the risk of decreased drug metabolism: Total bilirubin more than 1.5 mg/dL, aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) more than 2.5 X upper limit of normal*. (*AST and ALT more than 5 X upper limit of normal if hepatic metastases are present).\n7.
