    "exclusion_criteria": "* Any of the following:\n\n  * Pregnant women\n  * Nursing women\n  * Men or women of childbearing potential who are unwilling to employ adequate contraception\n* Co-morbid systemic illnesses or other severe concurrent disease which, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study or interfere significantly with the proper assessment of safety and toxicity of the prescribed regimens\n* Immunocompromised patients and patients known to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive and currently receiving antiretroviral therapy. * NOTE: Patients known to be HIV, but without clinical evidence of an immunocompromised state, are eligible for this trial\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements\n* Prior open neurosurgery for malignancy\n* Known or clinically suspected primary germ cell tumor, small cell carcinoma, or lymphoma\n* History of whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT)\n* Known allergy to gadolinium, pacemaker, or other contraindication such as metal implant that is not safe for MRI. Patients with MRI-compatible implants including MRI compatible pacemakers are eligible\n* Leptomeningeal metastasis/disease\n* A brain metastasis that is located =< 5 mm of the optic chiasm\n* Any brain metastasis > 5 cm in size\n* > 10 brain metastases\n* Indication for surgical resection of >= 2 brain metastases\n* Indication for long-term (anticipated greater than 4 weeks) 4 mg dexamethasone equivalent of steroids or bevacizumab\n* Actively enrolled on another brain metastases trial that is assessing the efficacy of either radiation or surgical interventions",
