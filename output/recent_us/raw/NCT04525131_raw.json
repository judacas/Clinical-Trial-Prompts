Patients who have received prior BCMA-directed bi-specific antibodies or antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) are not excluded.\n* Autologous HSCT within 6 weeks prior to enrollment or any prior history of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT)\n* Chemotherapy or any concomitant anti-cancer therapies (other than protocol prescribed lymphodepletion (LD) chemotherapy) within 2 weeks prior to apheresis\n* Treatment with small molecule targeted antineoplastics within 2 weeks of apheresis collection or 5 half-lives whichever is shorter\n* Have received antibodies or immunotherapies (other than daratumumab) within 4 weeks prior to apheresis collection. Daratumumab within 3 weeks prior to apheresis collection.",
