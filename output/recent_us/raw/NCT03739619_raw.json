Pregnancy tests must be medically supervised with a minimum sensitivity of 25mIU/ml. NOTE: a female of childbearing potential is a female who: 1) has achieved menarche at some point, 2) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or 3) has not been naturally postmenopausal (amenorrhea following cancer therapy does not rule out childbearing potential) for at least 24 consecutive months, i.e. has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months. Documentation of postmenopausal status must be provided. Further information on pregnancy testing and the definition of a female of childbearing potential located in the CC-99282 pregnancy prevention plan document\n* Females of childbearing potential are required to use 2 forms of effective methods of contraception or to agree to practice complete abstinence from the time of informed consent, without interruption, at least 28 days before starting CC-99282, throughout the entire duration of CC-99282, during dose interruptions and for at least 6 months and 2 weeks after the last dose of golcadomide (BMS-986369)/CC-99282.
