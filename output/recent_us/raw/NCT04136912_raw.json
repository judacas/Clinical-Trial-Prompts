We will exclude anyone with more than three hospitalizations and/or have a terminal diagnosis because of the acuity of their conditions which may limit the effectiveness of the intervention. Physical therapy may impact the outcomes of the intervention and having impaired cognition may make it difficult for participants to engage in the nurse visits, set goals and participate in the ACT sessions.",
