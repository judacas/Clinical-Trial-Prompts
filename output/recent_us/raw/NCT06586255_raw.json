    "official_title": "A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Phase 2 Dose Ranging Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of 2 Dose Regimens of Intravenous TAK-954 for the Prophylaxis and Treatment of Postoperative Gastrointestinal Dysfunction in Patients Undergoing Large- and Small-Bowel Resection",
    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Participant is scheduled to undergo a laparoscopic-assisted or open partial small- or large-bowel resection.\n2. Participant's American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification is ASA 1 to 3.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Has significant mechanical bowel obstruction that is not expected to resolve after the surgery, short bowel syndrome, pre-existing clinically significant GI motility disorder (example, gastroparesis, scleroderma, chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction), uncontrolled diabetes (glycosylated hemoglobin [HbA1c] greater than [>] 10 percent [%]), has an active gastric pacemaker, or requires parenteral nutrition.\n2. Had previous major abdominal surgery (example, gastrectomy, gastric bypass, gastric sleeve, lap banding, Whipple, pancreatic resection, total/subtotal colectomy, hemicolectomy, extensive bowel resection).\n3. Had a history of radiation therapy to the abdomen or pelvis.\n4. Scheduled to undergo any of the following surgeries: low anterior resection, total or subtotal colectomy, colostomy, ileostomy or reversal of stoma, or has a diagnosis that requires rectal resection (eg, tumors in the anorectum) and will likely require lower anterior resection surgery. Participants with planned surgery for which there is no anticipated significant rectal resection and is, therefore, likely to preserve anorectal function and continence postsurgery, will likely be eligible for inclusion in the study if they meet all the study inclusion/exclusion criteria (eg, participants with lesions not involving the rectum [sigmoid colon and above]).\n5. Has pre-existing hepatic disease that meets Child-Pugh Class B (moderate; total score 7 to 9 points) or C (severe; total score 10 to 15 points).\n6. Has received alvimopan, erythromycin, prucalopride, metoclopramide, domperidone, cisapride, mosapride, renzapride, or azithromycin in the 24 hours prior to starting study drug.\n7. Participant has known COVID-19 infection, or suspected COVID-19 infection.\n8. Scheduled for abdominal surgery that is classified as emergency.",
