Sexually active men, and women using oral contraceptive pills, should also use barrier contraception. Azoospermic male patients and women of childbearing potential who are continuously not heterosexually active are exempt from contraceptive requirements.\n\nAdditional Inclusion Criteria - Arms 1b and 2 only\n\n* Histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced or metastatic HNSCC that has progressed during or after a platinum-based chemotherapy and/or a programmed cell death receptor (PD)-1 or PD ligand 1 (PD-L1) targeting agent (separately or in combination therapy).\n* Metastatic or locoregionally recurrent HNSCC malignancy that is incurable by surgery or radiotherapy.\n* Arm 1b only, participants must have tumor tissue that is accessible for pretreatment and on-treatment tumor biopsy in the opinion of the Investigator and be willing and consent to undergo pretreatment and on-treatment biopsies per protocol.\n\nAdditional Inclusion Criteria - Arm 3 only\n\n* Histologically or cytologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic HNSCC (primary tumor location of oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx). Participants may not have a primary tumor site of nasopharynx (any histology).\n* Participants should have been treated with anti-PD-1/PD-L1-directed systemic therapy for incurable recurrent, advanced, or metastatic disease and experienced progressive disease. targeting agent (separately or in combination therapy).\n* Metastatic or locoregionally recurrent HNSCC malignancy that is incurable by surgery or radiotherapy.\n* Consent to provide HPV status assessed by p16 and results from baseline PD-L1 IHC assay score.\n* Consent to provide tumor tissue samples is required for enrollment.\n\nKey Exclusion Criteria - Arms 1a, 1b, 2, and 3\n\n* Previously received an anti-CCR8 antibody or anti-CCR8 targeted therapy.\n* History of Grade 4 allergic or anaphylactic reaction to any monoclonal antibody therapy or any excipient in the study drugs.\n* Major surgery within 4 weeks prior to Screening.\n* Unstable or severe uncontrolled medical condition (eg, unstable cardiac function, unstable pulmonary condition including pneumonitis and/or interstitial lung disease, uncontrolled diabetes, symptomatic fistula) or any important medical illness or abnormal laboratory finding that would, in the Investigator's judgment, increase the risk to the patient associated with his or her participation in the study.\n\nAdditional Exclusion Criteria - Arms 1b and 2 only\n\n* Received > 4 prior systemic regimens for advanced/metastatic disease.\n* Nasopharyngeal carcinoma or nasal cavity malignancies other than HNSCC (eg, adenocarcinoma and variants, neuroendocrine tumors, mucosal melanoma).\n* Receiving chronic anti-coagulation therapy (eg, warfarin, enoxaparin) that cannot be safely discontinued temporarily for the required biopsies (only for patients who provide tumor biopsies).\n\nAdditional Exclusion Criteria - Arm 3\n\n• Received ≥ 2 prior systemic regimens for advanced/metastatic disease.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
