Patients receiving hematopoietic growth factor support, including erythropoietin, darbepoetin, G-CSF, GM-CSF, and platelet stimulators (e.g., eltrombopag, romiplostim, or interleukin-11) must have a 2-week interval between growth factor support and the Screening assessments, but they may receive growth factor support during the study.\n\n  13. Patients must have:\n* At least a 2-week interval from the last red blood cell (RBC) transfusion prior to the start of study treatment\n* At least a 1-week interval from the last platelet transfusion prior to the start of study treatment\n* However, patients may receive RBC and/or platelet transfusions as clinically indicated per institutional guidelines during the study 14. Patients must be registered into the mandatory REVLIMID REMS™ program and be willing and able to comply with the requirements of the REVLIMID REMS™ program.\n\n  15. Female patients of childbearing potential (FCBP) must have a negative serum pregnancy test at Screening.
