    "exclusion_criteria": "* Involvement in the planning and/or conduct of the study (applies to both AstraZeneca staff and/or staff at the study site)\n* Previous enrollment in this study\n* Participation in another clinical study with an investigational product during the last 3 weeks\n* Any previous treatment with poly-adenosine diphosphate ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, including olaparib\n* Other malignancy unless curatively treated with no evidence of disease for ≥ 5 years except: adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer\n* Resting electrocardiogram (ECG) indicating uncontrolled, potentially reversible cardiac conditions, as judged by the investigator (e.g. unstable ischemia, uncontrolled symptomatic arrhythmia, congestive heart failure, Fridericia's corrected QT interval [QTcF] prolongation > 500 ms, electrolyte disturbances, etc.), or patients with congenital long QT syndrome\n* Patients receiving any systemic chemotherapy or radiotherapy (except for palliative reasons) within 3 weeks prior to study treatment\n* Concomitant use of known strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g. itraconazole, telithromycin, clarithromycin, protease inhibitors boosted with ritonavir or cobicistat, indinavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, boceprevir, telaprevir) or moderate CYP3A inhibitors (e.g. ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, diltiazem, fluconazole, verapamil); the required washout period prior to starting olaparib is 2 weeks\n* Concomitant use of known strong (e.g. phenobarbital, enzalutamide, phenytoin, rifampicin, rifabutin, rifapentine, carbamazepine, nevirapine and St John's wort) or moderate CYP3A inducers (e.g. bosentan, efavirenz, modafinil); the required washout period prior to starting olaparib is 3 weeks for enzalutamide, 5 weeks for phenobarbital and 3 weeks for other agents\n* Persistent toxicities (> Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event [CTCAE] grade 2) caused by previous cancer therapy, excluding alopecia\n* Patients with myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia or with features suggestive of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/acute myeloid leukemia (AML)\n* Patients with symptomatic uncontrolled brain metastases; a scan to confirm the absence of brain metastases is not required; the patient can receive a stable dose of corticosteroids before and during the study as long as these were started at least 4 weeks prior to treatment; patients with spinal cord compression unless considered to have received definitive treatment for this and evidence of clinically stable disease for 28 days\n* Major surgery within 2 weeks of starting study treatment and patients must have recovered from any effects of any major surgery\n* Patients considered a poor medical risk due to a serious, uncontrolled medical disorder, non-malignant systemic disease or active, uncontrolled infection; examples include, but are not limited to, uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia, history of prior myocardial infarction, uncontrolled major seizure disorder, uncontrolled hypertension (blood pressure [BP] ≥ 160/100), history of prior stroke, uncontrolled diabetes (glycosylated hemoglobin [hgb A1C] > 7), unstable spinal cord compression, superior vena cava syndrome, extensive interstitial bilateral lung disease on high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan or any psychiatric disorder that prohibits obtaining informed consent\n* Patients unable to swallow orally administered medication and patients with gastrointestinal disorders likely to interfere with absorption of the study medication\n* Immunocompromised patients, e.g., patients who are known to be serologically positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\n* Patients with a known hypersensitivity to olaparib or any of the excipients of the product\n* Patients with a known hypersensitivity to the testosterone cypionate or any of the excipients of the product\n* Patients with known active hepatitis (i.e., hepatitis B or C) due to risk of transmitting the infection through blood or other body fluids\n* Previous allogenic bone marrow transplant or double umbilical cord blood transplantation (dUCBT)\n* Whole blood transfusions in the last 120 days prior to entry to the study (packed red blood cells and platelet transfusions are acceptable)\n* Evidence of serious and/or unstable pre-existing medical, psychiatric or other condition (including laboratory abnormalities) that could interfere with patient safety or provision of informed consent to participate in this study\n* Any psychological, familial, sociological, or geographical condition that could potentially interfere with compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule\n* Evidence of disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, would put the patient at risk from testosterone therapy (e.g. femoral metastases with concern over fracture risk, spinal metastases with concern over spinal cord compression, lymph node disease with concern for ureteral obstruction)\n* Patients with pain attributable to their prostate cancer\n* Tumor causing urinary outlet obstruction that requires catheterization for voiding; patients that require catheterization to void secondary to benign strictures or other non-cancer causes will be permitted to enroll\n* Prior history of deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism within 5 years prior to enrollment in the study and not currently on systemic anticoagulation\n* Patients with NYHA (New York Heart Association) class III or IV heart failure or history of a prior myocardial infarction (MI) prior to enrollment in the study",
