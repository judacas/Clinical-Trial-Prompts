    "inclusion_criteria": "* Male or female subjects ≥18 years old or other legal maturity age according to the country of residence\n* Confirmed GI (colorectal, pancreatic, gastric, esophageal, gastro-esophageal junction or hepatobiliary) or confirmed GU (renal, ureteral, bladder, prostate, or urethra) cancers if:\n\n  * Unresectable, locally advanced, metastatic, or non-metastatic GI/GU cancer and\n  * No intended curative surgery during the study\n* Confirmed symptomatic or incidental proximal lower limb deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (i.e., popliteal, femoral, iliac, and/or inferior vena cava vein thrombosis) and/or a confirmed symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE), or an incidental PE in a segmental, or larger pulmonary artery. Patients are eligible within 120 hours from diagnosis of the qualifying VTE.\n* Anticoagulation therapy with LMWH for at least 6 months is indicated\n* Able to provide written informed consent\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Thrombectomy, insertion of a caval filter, or use of a fibrinolytic agent to treat the current (index) occurrence of DVT and/or PE\n* More than 120 hours of pre-treatment with therapeutic doses of UFH, LMWH, or other anticoagulants\n* An indication to continue treatment with therapeutic doses of an anticoagulant other than for VTE treatment prior to randomization (e.g., atrial fibrillation, mechanical heart valve, prior VTE)\n* PE leading to hemodynamic instability (systolic BP <90 mmHg or shock).\n* Acute ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke or intracranial hemorrhage, in the last 4 weeks preceding screening.\n* Brain trauma, or cerebral or a spinal cord surgery or spinal procedures such as lumbar puncture or epidural/spinal anesthesia within 4 weeks of screening\n* Need for aspirin in a dosage of more than 100 mg/day or, any other antiplatelet agent alone or in combination with aspirin\n* Bleeding requiring medical attention at the time of randomization or in the preceding 4 weeks\n* Planned brain, spinal cord, cardiac, vascular, major thoracic and/or major abdominal surgery in the 4 weeks following randomization\n* History of heparin induced thrombocytopenia\n* Infective acute or subacute endocarditis at the time of presentation\n* Primary brain cancer or untreated intracranial metastasis\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 3 or 4 at screening\n* Life expectancy of <3 months at randomization\n* Calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl) <30 mL/min at the screening visit\n* Platelet count <50,000/ mm3 at the screening visit\n* Hemoglobin <8 g/dL at the screening visit\n* Acute hepatitis, chronic active hepatitis, liver cirrhosis; or an alanine aminotransferase ≥3 times and/or bilirubin ≥2 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) at the screening visit in the absence of clinical explanation\n* Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure [BP] > 180 mm Hg or diastolic BP >100 mm Hg despite antihypertensive treatment)\n* Women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) who are unwilling or unable to use highly effective contraceptive measures during the study from screening up to 3 days after last treatment of dalteparin or 100 days after administration of abelacimab\n* Sexually active males with sexual partners of childbearing potential must agree to use a condom or other reliable contraceptive measure up to 3 days after last treatment of dalteparin or 100 days after administration of abelacimab\n* Pregnant or breast-feeding women\n* History of hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs (including dalteparin) or its excipients, to drugs of similar chemical classes, or any contraindication listed in the label for dalteparin\n* Subjects with any condition that in the judgement of the Investigator would place the subject at increased risk of harm if he/she participated in the study\n* Use of other investigational (not-registered) drugs within 5 half-lives prior to enrollment or until the expected pharmacodynamic effect has returned to baseline, whichever is longer. Participation in academic non-interventional studies or interventional studies, comprising testing different strategies or different combinations of registered drugs is permitted.",
