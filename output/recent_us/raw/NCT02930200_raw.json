    "official_title": "A Single Arm, Open-label, Phase IIb Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of the Combination of Cediranib and Olaparib Tablets in Women With Recurrent Platinum Resistant Epithelial Ovarian Cancer, Including Fallopian Tube and/or Primary Peritoneal Cancer Who do Not Carry a Deleterious or Suspected Deleterious Germline BRCA Mutation",
    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Ability and willingness to provide written informed consent, and to comply with the requirements of the protocol\n2. Females aged ≥18 years with previous histologically proven diagnosis of high grade serous, high grade endometroid or clear cell ovarian cancer, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal carcinoma\n3. No evidence of deleterious or suspected deleterious germline mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes\n4. Recurrent platinum-resistant disease, defined as disease progression within 6 months (182 days) of the last receipt of platinum-based chemotherapy\n5. CT/MRI evidence of measurable disease as per RECIST 1.1 defined as at least one lesion, not previously irradiated, that can be accurately measured at baseline as ≥ 10 mm in the longest diameter (except lymph nodes which must have short axis ≥ 15 mm) and which is suitable for accurate repeated measurements\n6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2\n7. Life expectancy ≥12 weeks\n8. Prior receipt of antiangiogenic treatment, including but not limited to bevacizumab, is optional. If used, it can be used in the first line or recurrent setting.\n9. At least three prior lines of therapy for advanced ovarian cancer as defined in the protocol\n10. Confirmation of the availability of a tumor sample from the primary or recurrent cancer must be provided\n11. Patients must have adequate organ and bone marrow function\n12. Adequately controlled blood pressure\n13. Adequately controlled thyroid function, with no symptoms of thyroid dysfunction\n14. Able to swallow and retain oral medications and without gastrointestinal illnesses that would preclude absorption of cediranib or olaparib\n15. Postmenopausal or evidence of non-childbearing status for women of childbearing potential as confirmed by a negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to start of IPs\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be FEMALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 120 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Involvement in the planning and/or conduct of the study (applies to both AstraZeneca staff and/or staff at the study site).\n2. Previous enrollment in the present study.\n3. Exposure to any IP during the last 4 weeks prior to enrollment.\n4. Previous treatment with PARP inhibitor. For this study, BSI-201 (iniparib) is not considered as PARPi\n5. Recent cancer-directed therapies: Radiotherapy (RT) within 4 weeks, chemotherapy or other systemic anti-cancer therapy within 4 weeks, or prior anti-angiogenic treatment (e.g., bevacizumab) within 6 weeks prior to starting treatment\n6. Cancer antigen-125 (CA-125) only disease without RECIST 1.1 measurable disease\n7. Major surgical procedure within 2 weeks prior to starting treatment; patients must have recovered from any effects of any major surgery and surgical wound should have healed prior to starting treatment\n8. Clinically significant signs and/or symptoms of bowel obstruction within 3 months prior to starting treatment\n9. History of intra-abdominal abscess within 3 months prior to starting treatment\n10. History of GI perforation. Patients with a history of abdominal fistula will be considered eligible if the fistula was surgically repaired, there has been no evidence of fistula for at least 6 months prior to starting treatment, and patient is deemed to be at low risk of recurrent fistula\n11. Other malignancy within the last 5 years\n12. Persisting ≥Grade 2 CTCAE toxicity (except alopecia and Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy) from previous anti-cancer treatment(s)\n13. Central nervous system metastases\n14.

Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < lower limit of normal (LLN) per institutional guidelines, or <55%, if threshold for normal not otherwise specified by institutional guidelines, for patients with the following risk factors: Prior treatment with anthracyclines; Prior treatment with trastuzumab; Prior central thoracic RT, including exposure of heart to therapeutic doses of ionizing RT; History of myocardial infarction within 6-12 months prior to start of IPs; Prior history of other significant impaired cardiac function\n16. History of stroke or transient ischemic attack within 6 months\n17. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness\n18. Patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/ treatment-related acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML) or with features suggestive of MDS/AML\n19. No prior allogenic bone marrow transplant or double umbilical cord blood transplantation\n20. Known active human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C infection on antiviral treatment\n21. Concomitant use of known strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors\n22.
