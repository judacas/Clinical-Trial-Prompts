    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Histologically confirmed, metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Patients with adenosquamous carcinoma and mixed adenocarcinoma/neuroendocrine carcinoma (MANEC) of the pancreas are eligible, but pure neuroendocrine neoplasms are excluded.\n2. Progression of disease or intolerance to at least one standard line of chemotherapy.\n\n   1. Patients who are candidate for an anti-PD-1 antibody due to Microsatellite instability -High (MSI-H) or tumor mutational burden (TMB)-high status must have been treated with this drug before being eligible for this trial.\n   2. Prior treatment with an anti-PD(L)-1 antibody is allowed unless this therapy was stopped due to an immune-related adverse event.\n   3. Patients who are candidate for a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor due to a germline BRCA1/2 mutation must have been treated with this drug before being eligible for this trial.\n3. At least one tumor measurable by CT scan. Measurable disease is defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for non-nodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as >20 mm with conventional techniques or >10 mm with spiral CT scan.\n4. Adult patients (≥ 18 years of age).\n5. Male or non-pregnant and non-lactating female. Men and women with intact reproductive potential must agree to use contraception as outlined in Section 4.9.\n6. Adequate biological parameters as demonstrated by the following blood counts at Screening (obtained ≤ 21 days prior to enrollment) and at Baseline-Day 0:\n\n   1. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.0 × 10^9 cells/L.\n   2. Platelet count ≥ 100,000 cells/mm3 (100 × 10^9 cells/L).\n   3. Hemoglobin (Hgb) ≥ 9 g/dL.\n7. Adequate blood chemistry levels at Screening (obtained ≤ 21 days prior to enrollment) and at Baseline-Day 0:\n\n   1. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) - serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT); alanine transaminase (ALT) - serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) range, unless liver metastases are present, then ≤ 5 × ULN is allowed.\n   2. Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × ULN.\n   3. Estimated creatinine clearance of > 60 mL/min (per Cockcroft-Gault formula).\n   4. Albumin ≥ 3.0 g/dL.\n8. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status from 0 to ≤ 1 (see APPENDIX A: PERFORMANCE STATUS SCALES).\n9. At least two weeks since the last anti-cancer therapy (e.g., chemotherapy, radiation therapy).\n10. All toxicities from the last anti-cancer therapy should be resolved to < grade 1.\n11. Patient has been informed about the nature of the study, has agreed to participate in the study, and signed the Informed Consent Form (ICF) prior to participation in any study-related activities.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Patients with pure neuroendocrine neoplasms of the pancreas.\n2. Brain metastases.\n3. Uncontrolled ascites.\n4. Increase of ECOG to > 1 between screening and enrollment.\n5. Corrected QT interval (QTcF) > 450 msec.\n6. Active, uncontrolled bacterial, viral, or fungal infection(s) requiring systemic therapy.\n7. History of HIV and/or Hepatitis B or C infection.\n8. History of active autoimmune disease that, in the opinion of the Investigator, could deteriorate upon treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor.\n9. Concurrent use of systemic corticosteroids equivalent to or greater than prednisone 10 mg/day within two weeks of start of study therapy.\n10. Receipt of a live vaccine within 30 days prior to enrollment.\n11. Patients who are not up to date on FDA-approved coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination series will be excluded.\n12. Any impairment of gastrointestinal function or gastrointestinal disease that may significantly alter the absorption of the study drugs (e.g., ulcerative diseases, uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome, or extensive small bowel resection).\n13. History of interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis.\n14. History of liver disease as follows:\n\n    1. Cirrhosis\n    2. Autoimmune hepatitis\n    3. Portal hypertension\n    4. Drug-induced liver steatosis\n15. Clinically significant, uncontrolled heart disease and/or cardiac repolarization abnormality, including any of the following:\n\n    1. History of myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, symptomatic pericarditis, or coronary artery bypass graft within six months prior to study entry\n    2. Documented cardiomyopathy\n    3. Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) <50% as determined by Multiple Gated acquisition (MUGA) scan or echocardiogram (ECHO)\n16. Long QT syndrome or family history of idiopathic sudden death or congenital long QT syndrome or any of the following risk factors for Torsades de Pointe, including uncorrected hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, history of cardiac failure, or history of clinically significant/symptomatic bradycardia.\n17. Concomitant medication(s) with a known risk to prolong the QT interval and/or known to cause Torsades de Pointe that cannot be discontinued or replaced by safe alternative medication (e.g., within five half-lives or seven days prior to starting study drug).\n18. Clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias (e.g., ventricular tachycardia), complete left bundle branch block, high-grade arterioventricular block (e.g., bifascicular block, Mobitz type II, and third-degree atrioventricular block).\n19.
