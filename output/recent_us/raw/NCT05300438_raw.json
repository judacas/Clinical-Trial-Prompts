    "official_title": "Phase 1, Open Label Clinical Trial to Treat Stage IV Cancer Patients With Multiple Patient-specific Mutated Cell Surface Proteins With Chimeric Antibodies",
    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Subjects 18 years of age or older who have biopsy proven cancer. The following types of malignancy will be eligible:\n\n   Stage IV cancer of the following types: breast cancer, colon cancer, esophageal cancer, kidney cancer, lung cancer, lymphoma, melanoma, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, bladder urothelial carcinoma, and stomach cancer.\n2. Subjects who have refractory or progressive disease after at least 1 line of systemic treatment or who have declined additional curative standard of care therapy(ies).\n3. Subjects willing to consent to obtaining a blood sample and archived tumor tissue for tumor extraction and amplification. If archived tumor tissue is not available, a new biopsy sample will be required. If sequencing was previously completed under Moonshot Antibodies IRB protocol #20233336, these results and samples may be used and duplicative tumor sequencing will not be necessary.\n4. Subjects must have measurable disease as defined per section 7 at the time of biopsy. Archived tumor must be available or tumor must be accessible for biopsy.\n5. Karnofsky Score must be ≥ 60\n6. Hematological:\n\n   1. ANC (Absolute neutrophil count) ≥ 1000/µl (unsupported)\n   2. Platelets ≥ 100,000/µl (can be transfused)\n   3. Hemoglobin > 8 g/dL (can be transfused)\n7. Renal: Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of institutional normal.\n8. Adequate liver function must be demonstrated, defined as:\n\n   1. Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN)\n   2. ALT (SGPT) ≤ 3 times upper limit of normal (ULN)\n   3. AST (SGOT) ≤ 3 times upper limit of normal (ULN)\n9. A negative serum pregnancy test is required for female participants of childbearing potential (≥13 years of age or after onset of menses)\n10. Both male and female post-pubertal study subjects need to agree to use one of the more effective birth control methods during treatment and for six months after treatment is stopped. These methods include total abstinence (no sex), oral contraceptives (\"the pill\"), an intrauterine device (IUD), levonorgestrel implants (Norplant), or medroxyprogesterone acetate injections (Depo-Provera shots). If none of these can be used, contraceptive foam with a condom is recommended.\n11. Informed Consent: All subjects must sign informed written consent.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Insufficient tumor tissue for whole exome sequencing.\n2. Known human immunodeficiency virus infection.\n3. Subjects who have received any cytotoxic treatment within 3 weeks of antibody treatment.\n4. Subjects who have received any radiotherapy to the primary sample site within the last 14 days (radiation may be included in treatment decision after biopsy).\n5. Subjects who have received live vaccines within 30 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment and while participating in the trial. Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster, yellow fever, rabies, BCG, and typhoid vaccine.\n6. Subjects who are currently receiving or have received systemic therapeutic corticosteroids ≤2 weeks prior to starting treatment.\n7. Subjects receiving any investigational drug concurrently.\n8. Subjects with chronic active autoimmune diseases undergoing treatment.\n9. Subjects who have had prior organ transplant.\n10. Subjects who have developed allergic responses to chimeric antibodies.\n11. Subjects with symptomatic known brain metastases < 4 weeks from radiation treatment\n12. Subjects with significant (>Grade 2 toxicity) renal, cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic or other organ dysfunction.\n13. Subjects with secondary cancers that require systemic treatment.\n14. Subjects that are pregnant or breastfeeding.\n15. Subjects with uncontrolled serious infections or a life-threatening illness (unrelated to tumor) including, but not limited to symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia.\n16. Subjects with any other medical condition, including malabsorption syndromes, mental illness or substance abuse, deemed by the Investigator to be likely to interfere with the interpretation of the results or which would interfere with a subject's ability to sign the informed consent, and subject's ability to cooperate and participate in the study.\n17. Adult subjects lacking capacity to consent.",
