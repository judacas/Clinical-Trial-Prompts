    "official_title": "A Phase 1/2 Single Arm Open-Label Clinical Trial of Gavocabtagene Autoleucel (Gavo-cel) in Patients With Advanced Mesothelin-Expressing Cancer",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Patient is at least 18 years of age at the time the Informed Consent is signed.\n* Patient has a pathologically confirmed diagnosis of either Malignant Pleural/Peritoneal Mesothelioma (MPM), Serous Ovarian Adenocarcinoma, Cholangiocarcinoma, or Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) at screening.\n* Patient's tumor has been pathologically reviewed by the central laboratory. For Serous Ovarian Adenocarcinoma, patients must have confirmed positive MSLN expression on >/= 30% of tumor cells that are 1+, 2+, and/or 3+ by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Ovarian patients will subsequently be stratified into two groups: high MSLN expression (>/= 50% of tumor cells that are 2+ and/or 3+) or low MSLN expression (>/= 30% of tumor cells that are 1+, 2+, and/or 3+ not meeting criteria for the high MSLN expression group). MPM patients must have MSLN expression of >/= 50% of tumor cells that are 2+ and/or 3+ by IHC. Cholangiocarcinoma and NSCLC patients must have MSLN expression of >/= 30% of tumor cells that are 1+, 2+, and/or 3+ by IHC.\n* Prior to gavo-cel infusion, patients must have received at least 1 systemic standard of care therapy for metastatic or unresectable disease, with the exception of Cholangiocarcinoma patients who may have elected not to pursue standard frontline therapy. Regardless of tumor type, patients must not exceed 5 prior lines of therapy (excluding bridging therapy and surgical procedures). More details provided in the clinical protocol.\n* Patient has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 or 1.\n* Patient has a left ventricular ejection fraction > 45% as measured by resting echocardiogram, with no clinically significant pericardial effusion.\n* Patient is fit for leukapheresis and has adequate venous access for the cell collection.\n* Patient must have adequate organ function as indicated by the laboratory values in the clinical protocol\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
