    "official_title": "Effectiveness of Two Different Forms of Marine Oil, Derived From the New Zealand Green Lipped Mussel and Krill Oil, on Indirect Markers of Muscle Damage and Soreness During Recovery From Muscle Damaging Exercise in Untrained Men",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Subjects will include males (18 to 30 years), determined to be low risk (as determined by ACSM's Guidelines for Exercise Testing and Prescription (American College of Sports Medicine., Thompson, Gordon, & Pescatello, 2010)\n* BMI<30 (not obese) by a modified physical activity readiness questionnaire (PAR-Q),\n* Classified as 'untrained' defined by not habitually exercising more than 3x/week. In order to participate subjects would be allowed to exercise not more than three days a week. Each of the exercise sessions must not be longer than 30 minutes and cannot include downhill or uphill running.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be MALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 30 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* History of asthma or exercise-induced asthma, COPD, interstitial lung diseases, or cystic fibrosis, dyspnea\n* History of downhill running training or other eccentric endurance exercise within the past 3 months\n* History of fish oil or other omega-3 nutritional supplements within the last 3 months\n* History of significant pain in hips or knees\n* Current participation in a strength training program or having participated in a strength training program within 60 days before the study\n* Regular use of anti-inflammatory medication or nutritional supplements (e.g. ketorolac, celecoxib, creatine, protein drinks, amino acids, fish oil or vitamins)\n* Current daily use of anti-inflammatory medication such as Tylenol, Advil, or Aleve.\n* Allergies to fish, seafood, or shellfish\n* Family or personal history of cardiac, peripheral vascular, or cerebrovascular disease.\n* A diabetic or experience shortness of breath as determined by the modified PAR_Q.\n* In addition to screening subjects for known cardiovascular disease, or signs and symptoms of pulmonary metabolic disease, subjects will be excluded if their values are outside ACSM's guidelines for cardiovascular disease risk as outlined in Figure 2. This would place subjects as low risk. Researchers will be screening based on age, family history of heart attacks, exposure to cigarette smoke, obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia and pre-diabetes. Since subjects are recruited as sedentary, this a positive risk factor for CVD. Subjects will be screened for dyslipidemia and will be accepted into the study if their values are for low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C) cholesterol less than 130 mg dL-1 (3.37 mmol·L-1) or a total serum cholesterol value of less than 200 mg·dL-1 (5.18mmol L-1) or and HCL-C is greater or equal to 40 mg·dL-1 (1.55mmol L-1). Please note that this will not change the subjects risk status and they will be still classified as low risk. Subjects should not be currently taking and cholesterol lowering medication such as: Atorvastatin (Lipitor), Fluvastatin (Lescol), Lovastatin (Mevacor), Pravastatin (Pravachol), Simvastatin (Zocor), Rosuvastatin (Crestor)",
