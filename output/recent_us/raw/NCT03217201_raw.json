Females not of reproductive potential include females who have been in natural menopause for at least 24 consecutive months, or who have had a hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy, or female children who have not started menstruating\n* Agree to use effective contraception during study treatment and for 4 weeks after last dose of lenalidomide and for 3 months after last dose of tafasitamab (whichever is longer) Females of reproductive potential must commit either to abstain continuously from heterosexual sexual intercourse or to use two methods of reliable birth control simultaneously: one highly effective form of contraception - tubal ligation, intrauterine device (IUD), hormonal (birth control pills, injections, hormonal patches, vaginal rings, or implants), or partner's vasectomy, and one additional effective contraceptive method - male latex or synthetic condom, diaphragm, or cervical cap. Contraception should continue during therapy, during dose interruptions, and for 4 weeks following discontinuation of lenalidomide and for 3 months after discontinuation of tafasitamab (whichever is longer). Reliable contraception is indicated even where there has been a history of infertility, unless due to hysterectomy. If needed, females of reproductive potential should be referred to a qualified provider of contraceptive methods Males must always use a latex or synthetic condom during any sexual contact with females of reproductive potential during trial therapy, during dose interruptions, and for 4 weeks following discontinuation of lenalidomide and for 3 months after discontinuation of tafasitamab (whichever is longer), even if they have undergone a successful vasectomy.
