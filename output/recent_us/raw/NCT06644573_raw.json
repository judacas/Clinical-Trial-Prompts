Men must agree to not donate sperm during and for 90 days after the last dose of study drug\n* Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum (beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [B-hCG]) pregnancy test at screening. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding are ineligible for this study\n* Sign (or their legally-acceptable representatives must sign) an informed consent document indicating that they understand the purpose of and procedures required for the study, including biomarkers, and are willing to participate in the study\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Known active central nervous system lymphoma or leptomeningeal disease\n* Follicular lymphoma with evidence of diffuse large B-cell transformation\n* Grade 3b follicular lymphoma\n* Any prior history of other malignancy besides follicular lymphoma, unless the patient has been free of disease for >= 5 years and felt to be at low risk for recurrence by the treating physician, except:\n\n  * Adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer or lentigo maligna without evidence of disease\n  * Adequately treated cervical carcinoma in situ without evidence of disease\n* Any life-threatening illness, medical condition, or organ system dysfunction which, in the investigator's opinion, could compromise the subject's safety, interfere with the absorption or metabolism of ibrutinib capsules, or put the study outcomes at undue risk\n* History of severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions to monoclonal antibody therapy (e.g., patients in whom dosing with obinutuzumab would be contraindicated for safety reasons)\n* Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), active hepatitis C virus, active hepatitis B virus infection, or known bacterial, viral, fungal, mycobacterial, parasitic active systemic infection requiring treatment with IV antibiotics or hospitalization within 4 weeks prior to the start of cycle 1\n\n  * Patients with inactive hepatitis B infection must adhere to hepatitis B reactivation prophylaxis unless contraindicated\n* Patients with a history of confirmed progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), positive test results for human T-lymphotropic 1 virus, or suspected active or latent tuberculosis\n* Clinically significant cardiovascular disease such as uncontrolled or symptomatic arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, or myocardial infarction within 6 months of screening, or any class 3 (moderate) or class 4 (severe) cardiac disease as defined by the New York Heart Association Functional Classification\n* Significant screening electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities including left bundle branch block, 2nd degree atrioventricular (AV) block, type II AV block, or 3rd degree block.
