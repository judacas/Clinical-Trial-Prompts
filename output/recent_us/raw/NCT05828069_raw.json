Patients who have received prior EGFR treatments for lung cancer\n10. Patients who have received prior treatment with an EGFR TKI including in the adjuvant setting\n11. Patients who have received previous treatment for metastatic or stage IV disease\n12. Prior treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy for advanced NSCLC\n13. Patients with a history of cancer that has been completely treated, with no evidence of malignant disease currently cannot be enrolled in the study if their chemotherapy was completed less than 6 months prior and/or have received a bone marrow transplant less than 2 years before the first day of study treatment\n14. Any unresolved toxicities from prior therapy greater than CTCAE grade 1 at the time of starting study treatment with the exception of alopecia and grade 2, prior platinum-therapy related neuropathy\n15. Any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic diseases, including uncontrolled hypertension and active bleeding diatheses or active infection (eg, patients receiving treatment for infection) including hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or active uncontrolled Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.\n16. Patients who have had a surgical procedure unrelated to the study within 14 days or major surgery within 1 month prior to the administration of the study drug\n17. Past medical history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), drug-induced ILD, radiation pneumonitis\n18. Any of the following cardiac criteria: Mean resting QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) more than 470 msec, obtained from 3 ECGs, using the screening clinic ECG machine derived QTc value. Any clinically important abnormalities in rhythm, conduction or morphology of resting ECG e.g. complete left bundle branch block, third degree heart block and second degree heart block. Any factors that increase the risk of QTc prolongation or risk of arrhythmic events such as heart failure, hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia, hypocalcaemia, congenital long QT syndrome, family history of long QT syndrome or unexplained sudden death under 40 years of age in first degree relatives or any concomitant medication known to prolong the QT interval\n19.
