    "inclusion_criteria": "* Histologically or cytologically confirmed, locally advanced (Stage III-IV) head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) undergoing surgical-based treatment with curative intent that is HPV-unrelated disease, defined as SCC of the oral cavity, larynx, or hypopharynx, p16 negative SCC of the oropharynx.\n* At least 18 years of age.\n* ECOG performance status ≤ 1\n* Normal bone marrow and organ function as defined below:\n\n  * Leukocytes ≥ 3.0 K/cumm\n  * Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 K/cumm\n  * Platelets ≥ 100 K/cumm\n  * Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x IULN\n  * AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤ 3.0 x IULN\n  * Creatinine clearance > 50 mL/min by Cockcroft-Gault\n* Able to swallow study drug\n* The effects of pyrimethamine on the developing human fetus are unknown.

    "exclusion_criteria": "* Prior therapy for this cancer.\n* A history of other malignancy with the exception of malignancies for which all treatment was completed at least 2 years before registration and the patient has no evidence of disease.\n* Prior treatment with pyrimethamine in the year prior to HNSCC diagnosis.\n* Currently receiving any other investigational agents.\n* A history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to pyrimethamine or other agents used in the study.\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, current use of systemic immunosuppressive medications, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, or cardiac arrhythmia.\n* Documented megaloblastic anemia due to folate deficiency.\n* Treatment with anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy in the year prior to HNSCC diagnosis.\n* Pregnant and/or breastfeeding.
