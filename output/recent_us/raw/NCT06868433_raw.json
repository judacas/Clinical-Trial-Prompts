    "exclusion_criteria": "* Prior allogeneic bone marrow transplantation or solid organ transplantation\n* Chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 2 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to cycle 1 day 1. However, the following therapies are allowed: * Hormone-replacement therapy or oral contraceptives * Herbal therapy intended as anticancer therapy must be discontinued for at least 1 week prior to enrollment)\n* Any subject who have not recovered to at least grade 2 from adverse events (other than alopecia) due to agents administered more than 2 weeks earlier. Treatment with any other investigational agent within 3 weeks\n* Currently taking FWG\n* Treatment with systemic immunostimulatory agents (for example, interferon [IFN]-alpha or interleukin [IL]-2) within 6 weeks prior\n* Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medications (for example, corticosteroid, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate, thalidomide, calcineurin inhibitors, and anti-tumor necrosis factor [anti-TNF] agents) within 14 days prior to first dose of FWG. The following are exceptions to this criterion: * Intranasal, inhaled, topical or local steroid injections (e.g., intra-articular injection); steroids as premedication for hypersensitivity reactions; systemic corticosteroid at physiologic doses not to exceed 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent may be enrolled * Patients who have received acute, low dose, systemic immunosuppressant medications (e.g., a one-time dose of dexamethasone for nausea) may be enrolled * The use of inhaled corticosteroids and mineralocorticoids (e.g., fludrocortisone) for patients with orthostatic hypotension or adrenocortical insufficiency is allowed\n* Patients taking bisphosphonate therapy for hypercalcemia. Use of bisphosphonate therapy for other reasons (e.g., bone metastasis or osteoporosis) is allowed\n* Known history of allergic reactions or sensitivity attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to the study agent (e.g., gluten)\n* Active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders (including inflammatory bowel disease [e.g., colitis, Crohn's disease], diverticulitis with the exception of a prior episode that has resolved or diverticulosis, celiac disease, irritable bowel disease, or other serious gastrointestinal chronic conditions associated with diarrhea; systemic lupus erythematosus; Wegener's syndrome [granulomatosis with polyangiitis]; myasthenia gravis; Graves' disease; rheumatoid arthritis; hypophysitis; uveitis; etc.) within the past 3 years prior to the start of treatment.
