    "inclusion_criteria": "* Histologically documented advanced (metastatic and/or unresectable) disease as appropriate per cohort.\n\n  * Phase 1a Dose Escalation: High-grade serous epithelial carcinoma of the ovary, fallopian tube, or peritoneum, adenocarcinoma of the lung, or clear-cell renal cell carcinoma.\n  * Phase 1b Expansion:\n\n    * Cohort 1: High grade serous, endometrioid, or clear cell epithelial carcinoma of the ovary, fallopian tube, or peritoneum.\n    * Cohort 2: Squamous-cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma of the lung.\n    * Cohort 3: Clear cell or papillary RCC.\n* Disease must have unequivocally progressed during or after at least 1 prior line of systemic therapy that must include the following parameters (by indication):\n\n  * Phase 1a dose escalation and Phase 1b Cohort 1: Participants with EOC whose disease has progressed during or after 1 prior line (at least 4 cycles) of platinum-based chemotherapy and had disease progression within 6 months from the last dose of the platinum agent. Participants who received 2 or more lines of platinum therapy must have disease which has progressed on or within 6 months after the date of the last dose of the platinum agent. Participants with BRCA-mutated EOC must have received previous PARP inhibitor therapy.\n  * Phase 1a dose escalation and Phase 1b Cohort 2: Participants with NSCLC whose disease has progressed after 1 prior line of platinum-based doublet chemotherapy and a CPI. Participants with targetable mutations (e.g. EGFR/ALK/KRAS) are required to have progressed on targeted therapy in addition to a platinum-based doublet chemotherapy\n  * Phase 1a dose escalation and Phase 1b Cohort 3: Participants with RCC whose disease has progressed after 1 prior line of antiangiogenic therapy and a PD-1-axis inhibitor.\n* Medically suitable for surgical resection of tumor tissue\n* Following tumor resection for TIL harvest, will have, at minimum, 1 remaining measurable lesion as identified by CT or MRI per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1\n* Adequate bone marrow and organ function\n\nKey\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* History of another primary malignancy within the previous 3 years\n* Phase 1a:\n\n  * EOC of the following subtypes: low-grade, endometrioid, clear cell, mucinous, sarcomatous, or mixed.\n  * NSCLC of the following subtypes: squamous, neuroendocrine differentiation.\n  * RCC of the following subtypes: nonclear-cell RCC\n* Phase 1b:\n\n  * Cohort 1: Participants with mucinous, sarcomatous, and low-grade EOC.\n  * Cohort 2: Participants with small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC with neuroendocrine differentiation\n  * Cohort 3: Participants with nonclear-cell RCC, except papillary RCC\n* Previously received an allogeneic stem cell transplant or organ allograft\n* Previously received TIL or engineered cell therapy (eg, CAR T-cell)\n* Significant cardiac disease\n* Stroke or transient ischemic attack within 12 months of enrollment\n* History of significant central nervous system (CNS) disorder\n* Symptomatic and/or untreated CNS metastases\n* History of significant autoimmune disease within 2 years prior to enrollment\n* Known history of severe, immediate hypersensitivity reaction attributed to cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), human serum albumin (HAS), phosphate buffer or gentamycin",
