Has adequate liver function:\n\n   * Total bilirubin below ULN (except for patients with Gilbert's Syndrome who must have a total bilirubin <3 × ULN).\n   * Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤2.5 × ULN (in patients with liver metastases, <5 × ULN is allowed).\n   * Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) <5 × ULN in patients with documented liver or bone metastases, or ALP < 2 × ULN in patients without documented metastases.\n10. Has adequate renal function (creatinine clearance ≥50 mL/min by Cockcroft-Gault formula) or patients with normal plasmatic creatinine despite creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min as per Cockcroft-Gault formula are eligible for the study.\n11. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) and women who have ≤ 2 years amenorrhea after start of menopause: has a negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1.\n12. Contraception requirements:\n\n    * Female patients of childbearing potential must agree to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use a highly effective contraceptive method (Pearl Index failure rate <1% per year) during the treatment period and for at least 6 months after the last dose of study drug.\n    * Male patients with female partners of childbearing potential must agree to using 2 acceptable methods of contraception (Pearl Index failure rate <1% per year), including a barrier method (with or without spermicide) during the treatment period and for at least 6 months after the last dose of study drug.\n    * Male patients must agree to refrain from sperm donation during the treatment period and for at least 6 months after the last dose of study drug.\n13. All patients should have peripheral veins or central line that are, in the opinion of the Investigator or delegate, suitable for peripheral or central intravenous infusion of AVA6000.\n14.
