    "inclusion_criteria": "* Documented informed consent of the participant and/or legally authorized representative\n\n  * Assent, when appropriate, will be obtained per institutional guidelines\n  * For research participants who do not speak English, a short form consent may be used with a City of Hope (COH) certified interpreter/translator to proceed with screening, while the request for a translated full consent is processed\n* Agreement to allow the use of archival tissue from diagnostic tumor biopsies\n\n  * If unavailable, exceptions may be granted with Study principal investigator (PI) approval\n* Age: >= 18 years\n* Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) >= 70\n* Life expectancy >= 16 weeks at the time of enrollment\n* Prior allogeneic transplant allowed if > 6 months prior to study enrollment\n* Participant must have a confirmed diagnosis of active CD33+ AML de novo, or secondary OR participants who are at a high risk for disease recurrence\n\n  * Relapsed AML is defined as patients that had a first complete response (CR) before developing recurrent disease (increased bone marrow blasts)\n  * Refractory AML is defined as patients that have not achieved a first CR after induction chemotherapy. For patients with AML evolving from myelodysplastic syndrome, they should have completed at least one cycle of induction chemotherapy\n* Research participants must have bone marrow and/or peripheral blood samples available for confirmation of diagnosis of AML\n\n  * CD33 positivity must be confirmed by either flow cytometry or immunohistochemistry within 90 days of study entry. Cytogenetics, flow cytometry, and molecular studies (such as FLT-3 status) will be obtained as per standard practice\n  * Research participants who are at a high risk of disease recurrence, they must have historical bone marrow and/or peripheral blood samples available for confirmation of diagnosis of AML\n* No known contraindications to lymphodepleting agents, steroids, tocilizumab and/or cetuximab, or the investigational agent\n* Total serum bilirubin =< 2.0 mg/dL\n* Participants with Gilbert syndrome may be included if their total bilirubin is =< 3.0\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) =< 3 x the upper limit of normal (ULN)\n* Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) =< 3 x ULN\n* Estimated creatinine clearance of >= 60 mL/min per the Cockcroft-Gault formula, and the participant is not on hemodialysis\n* Left ventricular ejection fraction >= 50% within 8 weeks before enrollment\n* Oxygen (O2) saturation > 92% not requiring oxygen supplementation\n* Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP): negative urine or serum pregnancy test\n* If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required\n* Agreement by females and males of childbearing potential to use an effective method of birth control or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course of the study through at least 6 months after the last dose of protocol therapy\n\n  * Childbearing potential defined as not being surgically sterilized (men and women) or have not been free from menses for > 1 year (women only)\n* Research participants must have a potential donor or stem cell source identified for allogeneic transplantation, either related (7/8 or 8/8 allele matched or haploidentical)\n* DONOR: The identified donor must be the original donor whose stem cells were used for the research participant's allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT)\n* DONOR: The donor must be HIV negative\n* DONOR: KPS >= 70\n* DONOR: Documented body weight\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Prior allogeneic transplant if < 6 months prior to enrollment\n* Concurrent use of systemic steroids or chronic use of immunosuppressant medications should be stopped 28-days prior to enrollment. Recent or current use of inhaled or topical steroids in standard doses is not exclusionary. Physiologic replacement of steroids (prednisone =< 7.5 mg/day, or equivalent doses of other corticosteroids) is allowed\n* Participants with active autoimmune disease, including graft versus host disease (GvHD), requiring systemic immune suppressive should be stopped 28-days prior to enrollment\n* Participants may not be receiving any other investigational agents and are not dependent on concurrent biological therapy, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy\n\n  * With exception to Hydrea which must be stopped prior to initiation of lymphodepletion\n* Research participants on active systemic antifungal treatment within 8 weeks of enrollment are not eligible. However, participants on antifungal prophylaxis are eligible\n\n  * Not applicable at the time of enrollment if the research participant's donor is undergoing leukapheresis\n* Subjects with >= Grade 2 myelofibrosis on bone marrow biopsy\n* Subjects with clinically significant arrhythmia or arrhythmias not stable on medical management within two weeks of screening if the patient is undergoing leukapheresis. Patients with controlled atrial arrythmia is allowed\n* Known bleeding disorders (e.g., von Willebrand's disease) or hemophilia\n* History of stroke or intracranial hemorrhage within 6 months prior to screening\n* Subjects with presence of other active malignancy, however, research participants with history of prior malignancy treated with curative intent and in complete remission are eligible\n* Clinically significant uncontrolled illness\n* Active infection requiring antibiotics\n* Research participants who have tested human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive, or have active hepatitis B or C infection based on testing performed within 4 weeks of enrollment\n* Active viral hepatitis\n* Females only: Pregnant or breastfeeding\n* Any other condition that would, in the Investigator's judgment, contraindicate the subject's participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns with clinical study procedures\n* Prospective participants who, in the opinion of the investigator, may not be able to comply with all study procedures (including compliance issues related to feasibility/logistics)",
