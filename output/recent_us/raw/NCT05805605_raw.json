Otherwise, she must agree to use, and be able to comply with two forms of contraception: one highly effective, and one additional effective (barrier) measure of contraception without interruption 28 days prior to starting mosunetuzumab, during the study treatment (including dose interruptions), and for at least 3 months after the completion of treatment.\n\nApproved methods of birth control are as follows: Hormonal contraception (i.e. birth control pills, injection, implant, transdermal patch, vaginal ring), Intrauterine device (IUD), Tubal Ligation or hysterectomy, Subject/Partner post vasectomy, Implantable or injectable contraceptives, and condoms plus spermicide. Not engaging in sexual activity for the total duration of the trial and the drug washout period is an acceptable practice; however periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of birth control. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.\n\nMale subjects must:\n\nA male subject who is sexually active with a female with reproductive potential must agree to use a barrier method of birth control, eg, either condom with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository or partner with occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/ suppository (including dose interruptions), even if they have undergone a successful vasectomy, from the time of signing consent and for at least 3 months after the completion of treatment. A male subject must agree not to donate sperm or semen, while taking treatment, during breaks (dose interruptions), and for at least 3 months after the completion of treatment.\n\nSign an informed consent document indicating that they understand the purpose of and procedures required for the study, including biomarkers, and are willing to participate in the study.\n\nThe investigator is responsible for: ensuring that the patient understands the potential risks and benefits of participating in the study; ensuring that informed consent is given by each patient, this includes obtaining the appropriate signatures and dates on the informed consent document prior to the performance of any study procedures and prior to the administration of study treatment; answering any questions the patient may have throughout the study and sharing in a timely manner any new information that may be relevant to the patient's willingness to continue his or her participant in the trial. Subjects will undergo a brief physical exam including a brief exam to determine cognitive review. No one without capacity to personally consent will be enrolled. Patients have medical decision-making capacity if they can demonstrate understanding of the situation, appreciation of the consequences of their decision, and reasoning in their thought process, and if they can communicate their wishes.\n\nA determination of lack of decision-making capacity shall be made after an appropriate medical evaluation that concludes there is little or no likelihood that the participant will regain decision-making capacity in a reasonable period of time.\n\n§A FCBP is a female who: 1) has achieved menarche at some point, 2) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy, or 3) has not been naturally postmenopausal (amenorrhea following cancer therapy does not rule out childbearing potential) for at least 24 consecutive months (ie, has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months).\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
