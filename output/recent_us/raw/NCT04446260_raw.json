    "official_title": "Prospective, Multicenter Study for the Evaluation of Safety and Performance of the Interscope EndoRotor Endoscopic Mucosal Resection System for the Removal of Alimentary Tract Mucosa in the Colon",
    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Subjects aged ≥18 to ≤85 years.\n2. At least one recurrent flat or sessile colorectal lesion measuring up to 6 cm in diameter and/or length.\n3. Presence of recurrent flat or sessile lesion where the EndoRotor may be used to resect recurrent neoplasia.\n4. Favorable anatomy that allows the investigator to access the lesion.\n5. Subject is able and willing to comply with site standard medical follow-up, including the 90-day follow-up visit.\n6. Subject has been informed of the nature of the study, agrees to participate and has signed the consent form.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 85 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Inability to give informed consent.\n2. Subject age is <18 years of age or >85 years of age.\n3. Presence of a lesion that represents cancer or has a high chance of harboring submucosal invasive cancer.\n4. Presence of synchronous lesions intended for resection that would require use of a concomitant resection modality\n5. Medical reasons the procedure cannot be performed (i.e. labile blood pressure, anticoagulation laboratory levels that are too high and risk excessive bleeding, systemic infection, etc.)\n6. Active antiplatelet therapy (Plavix , 325mg aspirin therapy) - patient off treatment for < 1 week.\n7. Inability to undergo a procedure under propofol sedation or General Anesthesia.\n8. Female patients who are known to be pregnant.\n9. Co-morbid conditions that place the subject at an unacceptable surgical risk (e.g., severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hepatic failure, cardiac disease, autoimmune disorders or conditions of severe immunosuppression).\n10. Any clinical evidence that the investigator feels would place the subject at increased risk with the deployment of the device.\n11. Subject is participating in another study of a device, medication, biologic, or other agent within 90 days and could, in the opinion of the investigator, impact the results of this study.\n12. Subject has other medical, social or psychological problems that in the opinion of the investigator would preclude them from receiving this treatment and the procedures and participating in evaluations pre- and post-treatment.",
