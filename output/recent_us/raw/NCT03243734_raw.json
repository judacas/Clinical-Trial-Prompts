Treatment with any MF-directed therapy within 14 days prior to treatment Day 1\n7. Prior treatment with more than one JAK2 inhibitor\n8. Prior treatment with with ruxolitinib, if BOTH of the following conditions are met:\n\n   i. exposure to higher-dose ruxolitinib (>10 mg daily) within 120 days prior to treatment Day 1 AND ii. total duration of treatment with higher-dose ruxolitinib (>10 mg daily) was >90 days, from first to last exposure (i.e., this 90-day period starts on the date of first administration of ruxolitinib at a total daily dose of >10 mg and continues for 90 calendar days, regardless of whether higher-dose ruxolitinib is administered continuously or intermittently).\n9. Prior treatment with any JAK2 inhibitor other than ruxolitinib, irrespective of dose, with a duration of >90 days. The 90-day period starts on the date of first administration of JAK2 inhibitor therapy and continues for 90 calendar days, regardless of whether therapy is administered continuously or intermittently.\n10. Treatment with an experimental therapy, including MF-directed experimental therapies within 28 days prior to treatment Day 1\n11. Systemic treatment with a strong CYP 3A4 inhibitor or a strong CYP 3A4 inducer within 14 days prior to treatment Day 1.

Significant recent bleeding history defined as National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade ≥2 within 3 months prior to treatment Day 1, unless precipitated by an inciting event (eg, surgery, trauma, or injury)\n13. Systemic treatment with medications that increase the risk of bleeding, including anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents (except for aspirin dosages of ≤100 mg per day),and daily use of cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) inhibiting non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) within 14 days prior to treatment Day 1.

Any history of CTCAE grade ≥2 non-dysrhythmia cardiac conditions within 6 months prior to treatment Day 1. Patients with asymptomatic grade 2 non-dysrhythmia cardiovascular conditions may be considered for inclusion, with the approval of the Medical Monitor, if stable and unlikely to affect patient safety.\n16. Any history of CTCAE grade ≥2 cardiac dysrhythmias within 6 months prior to treatment Day 1. Patients with non-corrected QT interval CTCAE grade 2 cardiac dysrhythmias may be considered for inclusion, with the approval of the Medical Monitor, if the dysrhythmias are stable, asymptomatic, and unlikely to affect patient safety.\n17. QT corrected by the Fridericia method (QTcF) prolongation >450 ms or other factors that increase the risk for QT interval prolongation (eg, hypokalemia [defined as serum potassium <3.0 mEq/L that is persistent and refractory to correction], or history of long QT interval syndrome).\n18.
