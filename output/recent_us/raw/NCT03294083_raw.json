    "inclusion_criteria": "* Histologically confirmed ACC or CRC\n* Radiographically measurable disease as assessed per RECIST 1.1, with at least 1 site of disease that is measurable and that has not been previously irradiated; or, if the patient has had previous radiation to the target lesion(s), there must be evidence of progression since the radiation\n* Patients with locally relapsed/refractory (R/R) advanced or metastatic ACC not amenable to potentially curative surgery or radiotherapy and progression of disease within 12 months at study entry\n* Patients with CRC must have locally R/R advanced or metastatic disease not amenable to potentially curative surgery or radiotherapy; must have been previously treated with, or are not considered candidates for, available therapies including fluoropyrimidines-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-based chemotherapies, anti-VEGF agents, and if RAS wild-type, an anti-EGFR therapy.\n* Adequate hematologic status, organ function, renal function, liver function and prothrombin time (PT) or INR ≤ 1.5 × ULN and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) or activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) ≤ 1.5 × ULN\n* Resolved acute effects of any prior therapy to baseline\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Major surgery or significant traumatic injury within 28 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1\n* Chemotherapy within 14 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1\n* Use of nitrosoureas or mitomycin C within 6 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day 1\n* Radiation therapy within 21 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1\n* Investigational drug use, targeted therapy, or biologic therapy within 28 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter, prior to Cycle 1 Day 1\n* Ongoing systemic infection requiring treatment with antibiotic, antiviral, or antifungal treatment\n* Active known second malignancy\n* Clinically significant cardiac disease\n* Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 or HIV-2 unless it's well-controlled HIV (eg, cluster of differentiation 4 [CD4] > 350/mm3 and undetectable viral load)\n* Current active liver disease including hepatitis A (hepatitis A [HepA] virus immunoglobulin M [IgM] positive), hepatitis B (hepatitis B virus [HBV] surface antigen positive), or hepatitis C (hepatitis C virus [HCV] antibody positive, confirmed by HCV RNA)\n* Refractory nausea and vomiting, malabsorption, external biliary shunt, or significant small bowel resection that would preclude adequate absorption\n* Uncontrolled diabetes\n* Treatment with a long-acting hematopoietic growth factor within 14 days before Cycle 1 Day 1 or a short-acting hematopoietic growth factor within 7 days before Cycle 1 Day 1\n* Treatment with high-dose chemotherapy and stem-cell rescue (autologous stem cell transplant) or allogeneic stem cell transplant within 90 days before Cycle 1 Day 1\n* Patients with central nervous system (CNS) metastases are not eligible, unless they have completed local therapy and have discontinued the use of corticosteroid throughout this indication for at least 4 weeks before starting treatment in this study\n* History of solid organ transplantation\n* Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination within 14 days prior to first dose of study drug\n* Prior treatment with a MYB inhibitor",
