Please note, participants with SLL must have identifiable B-cells in peripheral blood or bone marrow consistent with CLL/SLL immuno-phenotype, based on flow-cytometry, in order to be enrolled\n4. Subject must have indications for treatment per the 2018 iwCLL Guidelines.\n5. Subject has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score of ≤ 2.\n6. Subject must have adequate organ function defined as:\n\n   1. Creatinine clearance ≥ 30 mL/min (as estimated by the Cockcroft-Gault equation or the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation, or as measured by nuclear medicine scan or 24-hour urine collection).\n   2. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase ≤ 2.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) unless due to CLL/SLL.\n   3. Serum total bilirubin < 3.0 × ULN (unless documented Gilbert's syndrome)\n7. Subject must have adequate bone marrow function and meet the below thresholds unless approved by sponsor if cytopenias are felt to be due to significant marrow involvement of CLL:\n\n   1. Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.0 x103/μL\n   2. Hemoglobin ≥ 7 g/dL (can be transfused up to 1 week prior to study enrollment)\n   3.

History of suspected or confirmed PML\n10. Clinically significant cardiovascular disease including the following:\n\n    1. Myocardial infarction within 6 months before screening.\n    2. Unstable angina within 3 months before screening.\n    3. New York Heart Association class III or IV congestive heart failure\n    4. History of clinically significant arrhythmias (eg, sustained ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, torsades de pointes).\n    5.

Patients with stroke or CNS hemorrhage within 6 months.\n12. Pregnant or breastfeeding.\n\n14. Major surgical procedure within 28 days of first dose of study drug. If a subject had surgery, they must have recovered adequately from any toxicity or complications before the first dose of study drug.\n\n15. Has difficulty with or is unable to swallow oral medication or has significant gastrointestinal disease that would limit absorption of oral medication.\n\n16. Subject is known to be positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). 17. Active hepatitis C, as confirmed by being positive for Hep C RNA by PCR. 18. Active hepatitis B infection documented by a positive PCR for Hep B DNA. If hepatitis B serology is positive for hepatitis B core antibody, but Hep B DNA PCR is negative, patient is eligible to enroll.\n\n19. Subject requires:\n\n1. Strong and moderate CYP3A inhibitors within 7 days prior to the initiation of study treatment.\n2. Strong and moderate CYP3A inducers within 7 days prior to the initiation of study treatment.\n3.
