The effects of adagrasib on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because the therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women and men, who are sexually active and of childbearing potential, must agree to use two highly effective forms of contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for 6 months following termination of the study treatment (MDA Policy CLN 1114). This includes all female participants, between the onset of menses between 18 and 55 years, unless the patient presents with an applicable exclusionary factor which may be one of the following: (i) Postmenopausal (no menses in greater than or equal to 12 consecutive months); (ii) History of hysterectomy or bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy; (iii) Ovarian failure (Follicle Stimulating Hormone and Estradiol in menopausal range, who have received Whole Pelvic Radiation Therapy); (iv) History of bilateral tubal ligation or another surgical sterilization procedure; (v) radiation-induced oophorectomy with last menses at least 1 year ago; and (vi) chemotherapy-induced menopause with at least 1 year interval since last menses. Approved methods of birth control are as follows: Hormonal contraception (i.e. birth control pills, injection, implant, transdermal patch, vaginal ring), Intrauterine device (IUD), Tubal Ligation or hysterectomy, Subject/Partner post vasectomy, Implantable or injectable contraceptives, and condoms plus spermicide. Not engaging in sexual activity for the total duration of the trial and the drug washout period is an acceptable practice; however periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of birth control. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.\n  14. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception and avoid donating sperm prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 6 months after completion of the trial.\n  15. Prior treatment with a therapy targeting PARP or KRAS G12C mutation is permitted.\n  16. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n  17. Willing to comply with clinical trial instructions and requirements.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
