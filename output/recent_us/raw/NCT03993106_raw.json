Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately\n* Participant must understand the investigational nature of this study and sign an Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board approved written informed consent form prior to receiving any study related procedure\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Prior treatment with TAS-102 or irinotecan\n* Anti-cancer therapy within 2 weeks of the planned first dose of study medication\n* Unresolved toxicities from prior therapy of > grade 1, excluding alopecia or similar toxicities which are not deemed to be clinically significant or put the participant at greater risk.
