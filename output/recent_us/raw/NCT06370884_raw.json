Serum creatinine ≤ 2.0 x ULN or calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 30 mL/min (≥ 0.5 mL/sec) using the Cockcroft-Gault equation:\n\n   [(140 - age) x weight (kg)/(serum creatinine [mg/dL] × 72)] × 0.85 i. Urine protein/creatinine ratio (UPCR) ≤ 1 mg/mg (≤ 113.2 mg/mmol).\n8. Capable of understanding and complying with the protocol requirements and must have signed the informed consent document.\n9. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) ie. sexually active fertile patients and their partners must agree to use medically accepted methods of contraception (e.g., barrier methods, including male condom, female condom, or diaphragm with spermicidal gel) during the course of the study and for 5 months after the last dose of study treatment.\n10. Females should not breastfeed while receiving treatment on trial.\n11. Female patients of childbearing potential must not be pregnant at screening. Females of childbearing potential are defined as premenopausal females capable of becoming pregnant (i.e., females who have had any evidence of menses in the past 12 months, with the exception of those who had a prior hysterectomy). However, women who have been amenorrheic for 12 or more months are still considered to be of childbearing potential if the amenorrhea is possibly due to prior chemotherapy, antiestrogens, low body weight, ovarian suppression, or other reasons.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be FEMALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Prior treatment with cabozantinib.\n2.

Radiation therapy for bone metastasis within 2 weeks, any other radiation therapy within 4 weeks before first dose of study treatment. Systemic treatment with radionuclides within 6 weeks before the first dose of study treatment. Patients with clinically relevant ongoing complications from prior radiation therapy are not eligible.\n5.

Eligible patients must be neurologically asymptomatic and without corticosteroid treatment at the time of first dose of study treatment.\n6. Concomitant anticoagulation with coumarin agents (e.g., warfarin), direct thrombin inhibitors (e.g., dabigatran), direct factor Xa inhibitor betrixabin, or platelet inhibitors (e.g., clopidogrel). Allowed anticoagulants are the following:\n\n   1. Prophylactic use of low-dose aspirin for cardio-protection (per local applicable guidelines) and low-dose low molecular weight heparins (LMWH).\n   2. Therapeutic doses of LMWH or anticoagulation with direct factor Xa inhibitors rivaroxaban, edoxaban, or apixaban in subjects without known brain metastases who are on a stable dose of the anticoagulant for at least 1 week before first dose of study treatment without clinically significant hemorrhagic complications from the anticoagulation regimen or the tumor.\n7. The patient has prothrombin time (PT)/INR or partial thromboplastin time (PTT) test ≥ 1.3 X the laboratory ULN within 7 days before the first dose of study treatment.\n8. The patient has uncontrolled, significant intercurrent or recent illness including, but not limited to, the following conditions:\n\n   a. Cardiovascular disorders: i. Congestive heart failure New York Heart Association Class 3 or 4, unstable angina pectoris, serious cardiac arrhythmias.\n\n   ii.

Cavitating pulmonary lesion(s) or known endotracheal or endobronchial disease manifestation.\n\n   e. Lesions invading or encasing any major blood vessels. f.

Inability to swallow tablets.\n12. Previously identified allergy or hypersensitivity to components of the study treatment formulations.\n13. Diagnosis of another malignancy within 2 years before first dose of study treatment, except for superficial skin cancers, or localized, low-grade tumors deemed cured and not treated with systemic therapy.\n14. Patients with concurrent cytotoxic chemotherapy or radiation therapy are excluded.\n15. Patients with a serious chronic or acute illness, such as cardiac disease (NYHA class III or IV), hepatic disease, or other illness considered by the Principal Investigator as unwarranted high risk for investigational drug treatment.\n16. Patients with a medical or psychological impediment to probable compliance with the protocol should be excluded.\n17. Presence of a known active acute or chronic infection including: a urinary tract infection, HIV or viral hepatitis; however, it is acceptable to treat an acute infection and then re-screen or re-evaluate eligibility.\n18.
