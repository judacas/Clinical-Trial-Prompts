The local HER2 result must be from a tumour sample obtained in the metastatic setting.\n  3. Is documented as hormone receptor-positive (estrogen or progesterone receptor) or negative in the metastatic setting\n* Patient must have adequate tumor sample from the metastatic setting for biomarker assessment\n* ECOG Performance Status of 0 or 1\n* Part 1\n\n  1. Disease progression on or after the last systemic therapy prior to starting study treatment\n  2. At least 1 prior treatment line in metastatic setting required.\n* Part 2 (Modules 0 - 5)\n\n  a) No prior lines of therapy for advanced/MBC allowed\n* Part 2 (Module 6 and 7) a) Zero or one prior lines of therapy for advanced/MBC allowed\n\nCNS Inclusion\n\n* Modules 0 - 5 Patients must have no brain metastases or stable brain metastases.\n* Module 6 and 7 Patients must have untreated brain metastases not needing local therapy or previously treated brain metastases that have progressed since prior local therapy\n\nKey\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Uncontrolled or significant cardiovascular disease\n* Active or prior documented (non-infectious) ILD/pneumonitis that required steroids, or suspected ILD/pneumonitis that cannot be ruled out by imaging at screening\n* Lung-specific intercurrent clinically significant illnesses\n* Uncontrolled infection requiring IV antibiotics, antivirals, or antifungals\n* Spinal cord compression or a history of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis\n* Prior treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors\n* Prior treatment with an ADC containing a topoisomerase I inhibitor\n* Prior treatment with tucatinib\n\nCNS Exclusion\n\n* Modules 0 - 5: Has untreated brain metastasis\n* Module 6 and 7: Ongoing use of systemic corticosteroids for control of symptoms of brain metastases at a total daily dose of > 2 mg dexamethasone or any brain lesion thought to require immediate local therapy",
