Any significant medical condition, active infection (including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2) suspected or confirmed, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric illness that would prevent the subject from participating in the study.\n2. Any condition including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which places the subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study.\n3. Life expectancy ≤ 3 months.\n4. Diagnosis of lymphoblastic lymphoma.\n5. Aggressive lymphoma relapse requiring immediate cytoreductive therapy to avoid potential life-threatening consequences (eg, due to tumor location).\n6.
