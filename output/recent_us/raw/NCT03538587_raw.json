    "official_title": "A Phase 1b/2, Open Label, Dose Escalation Study of MGD007, a Humanized gpA33 × CD3 DART® Protein in Combination With MGA012, an Anti-PD-1 Antibody, in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Metastatic Colorectal Carcinoma",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Histologically proven, relapsed/refractory metastatic colorectal cancer\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1\n* Measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 criteria\n* Participants in the Dose Escalation Phase must have had recurrence, progression or intolerance to standard therapy consisting of at least 2 prior standard regimens (containing a fluoropyrimidine plus a platinum analogue and/or irinotecan) for metastatic disease. Participants in the Cohort Expansion portion will be allowed to participate after 1 prior standard regimen. Those who are inappropriate candidates for or have refused treatment with these regimens are also eligible. No more than 5 prior therapies are permitted. Patients previously treated with MGD007 on Study Protocol CP-MGD007-01 and who did not develop antibodies to MGD007 while on the CP-MGD007-01 study, may be enrolled. Patients that were previously treated on CP-MGD007-01 will only be treated on this study once MTD/MAD has been defined.\n* Availability of sufficient tumor specimens to enable retrospective determination of gpA33, CD3, PD-1, and PD-L1 expression\n* 30 participants in the Cohort Expansion portion must have lesions that are accessible for paired biopsies with acceptable clinical risk in the judgment of the investigator.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastases. No concurrent treatment for the CNS disease; no progression of CNS metastases on MRI or CT for at least 14 days after last day of prior therapy for the CNS metastases; no concurrent leptomeningeal disease or cord compression\n* History of known or suspected autoimmune disease with certain exceptions\n* History of prior allogeneic bone marrow, stem-cell, or solid organ transplantation.\n* Major surgery, systemic anti-neoplastic therapy, or investigational therapy within 4 weeks\n* Radiation therapy within 2 weeks\n* Systemic corticosteroids (≥ 10 mg per day prednisone or equivalent) or other immune suppressive drugs within the 14 days\n* History of Grade 3 or greater drug-related diarrhea/colitis during treatment with checkpoint inhibitors including anti-LAG-3, anti-PD-1, anti PD-L1, or anti-CTLA-4 antibodies\n* Clinically significant cardiovascular disease; gastrointestinal disorders; pulmonary compromise; viral, bacterial, or systemic fungal infections\n* History of positive testing for human immunodeficiency virus or history of acquired immune deficiency syndrome\n* History of hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection or known positive test for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B core antigen, or hepatitis C polymerase chain reaction.",
