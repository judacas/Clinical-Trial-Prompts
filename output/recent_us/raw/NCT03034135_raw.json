Post menopause is defined as amenorrhea >= 12 consecutive months. Note: women who have been amenorrheic for 12 or more months are still considered to be of childbearing potential if the amenorrhea is possibly due to prior chemotherapy, antiestrogens, ovarian suppression or any other reversible reason\n* No use of immunosuppressive medication within 7 days prior to randomization except:\n\n  * Intranasal, inhaled, topical steroids, or local steroid injections (e.g., intra-articular injection);\n  * Systemic corticosteroids at physiologic doses =< 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent;\n  * Steroids as premedication for hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., computed tomography [CT] scan premedication)\n* Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients on effective anti-retroviral therapy with undetectable viral load within 6 months are eligible for this trial\n* Patients with diabetes type I, vitiligo, psoriasis, or hypo or hyperthyroid disease not requiring immunosuppressive treatment are eligible\n* None of the following:\n\n  * Active autoimmune disease that might deteriorate when receiving the anti PD-L1 agent, avelumab.\n  * No known symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastases.

Baseline brain imaging with contrast-enhanced CT or MRI scans for subjects with known brain metastases is required to confirm eligibility.\n  * No major surgery within 4 weeks prior to randomization. Subjects must have complete wound healing from surgery before randomization. Subjects with clinically relevant ongoing complications from prior surgery are not eligible.\n  * No palliative radiotherapy within 48 hours prior to patient randomization.\n  * No hemoptysis of ≥ 0.5 teaspoon (2.5 mL) of red blood, clinically significant hematuria, hematemesis, coagulopathy, or other history of significant bleeding (eg.

The use of inactivated (killed) vaccines for the prevention of infectious disease is permitted. The use of COVID-19 vaccines is permitted.\n  * No uncontrolled, significant intercurrent or recent illness including, but not limited to, the following conditions:\n\n    * Cardiovascular disorders including:\n\n      * Congestive heart failure (CHF): New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III (moderate) or class IV (severe) at the time of screening.\n      * Concurrent uncontrolled hypertension defined as sustained blood pressure (BP) > 150 mm Hg systolic, or > 90 mm Hg diastolic despite optimal antihypertensive treatment.\n      * The patient has a known history of corrected QT interval calculated by the Fridericia formula (QTcF) > 500 ms and confirmed by electrocardiogram (ECG) within 28 days before randomization. Note: if initial QTcF is found to be > 500 ms, two additional electrocardiograms (EKGs) separated by at least 3 minutes should be performed. If the average of these three consecutive results for QTcF is ≤ 500 ms, the subject meets eligibility in this regard.\n      * Any history of congenital long QT syndrome.\n      * Stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), myocardial infarction, or other symptomatic ischemic event or thromboembolic event (eg, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism [DVT/PE]) within 6 months before randomization. Subjects with a diagnosis of incidental, subsegmental PE or DVT within 6 months are allowed if asymptomatic and stable at screening and treated with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or the direct factor Xa inhibitors rivaroxaban, edoxaban, or apixaban for at least 1 week before randomization. Non-symptomatic white matter disease in the brain is acceptable.\n    * No significant gastrointestinal disorders, particularly those associated with a high risk of perforation or fistula formation including unresolved active peptic ulcer disease, cholecystitis, diverticultis, symptomatic cholangitis or appendicitis, or malabsorption syndrome within 28 days of randomization.\n    * No other clinically significant disorders such as:\n\n      * Any active infection requiring systemic treatment within 14 days before randomization.
