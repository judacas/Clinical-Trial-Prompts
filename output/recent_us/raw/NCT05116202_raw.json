NMIBC with one solitary measurable tumor at the start of study, measuring ≥ 5 mm and ≤ 15 mm in greatest diameter (up to 4 additional low-grade Ta lesions, each measuring no more than 15 mm may be removed at screening provided a single lesion remains)\n5. Treatment-naïve or failed one previous regimen of intravesical therapy (BCG or chemotherapy)\n6. If recurrent disease, then more than 6 months from prior resection, more than 3 months from completion of last intravesical therapy with BCG, and more than 6 weeks from completion of last therapeutic intravesical therapy with chemotherapy\n7.

Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,500/mm3\n10. Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3\n11. Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN), or ≤ 3 x ULN in subjects with Gilberts disease\n12. Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN or creatinine clearance ≥ 30 mL/min\n13. Serum aspartate transaminase (AST) and serum alanine transaminase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 x ULN\n14. Willingness to participate in collection of pharmacokinetic samples\n15. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test.\n16. All subjects of childbearing potential must be willing to use effective contraception while on treatment and for 3 months after the last dose of VAX014\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Additional papillary disease at screening (in addition to the solitary low-grade Ta lesion detailed in the inclusion criteria) that\n\n   1. Consist of 6 or more lesions\n   2. Consists of any lesion with a maximal diameter of greater than 15 mm\n2. Confirmed or suspected perforated bladder\n3. History of difficult catheterization that in the opinion of the investigator will prevent administration of VAX014\n4. Presence or history of any high-grade urothelial cancer (including CIS) or high-grade urine cytology\n5. Intravesical chemo-or biological therapy within 6 months of first administration of VAX014\n6. UC of the ureters or urethra\n7. History of interstitial cystitis\n8. History of radiation to the pelvis\n9. History of vesicoureteral reflux or an indwelling urinary stent\n10. Other known active cancer(s) likely to require treatment or interfere with study objectives over the next two (2) years\n11. Active, uncontrolled bacterial, viral, or fungal infection(s) requiring systemic therapy\n12. Known HIV, Hepatitis B, or Hepatitis C infection\n13. Significant cardiovascular risk (e.g., coronary stenting within 8 weeks, myocardial infarction within 6 months)\n14.
