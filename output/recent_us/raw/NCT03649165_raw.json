SNOT-22 total score ≥ 30 at enrolment.\n\n   Patient must meet the following criteria (points 7-10) at the randomization visit:\n7. At least 8 days of evaluable daily diary data in the 14-day period prior to randomization (baseline bi-weekly mean score collected from study Day -13 to study Day 0).\n8. At randomization, a bi-weekly mean NBS ≥ 1.5.\n9. SNOT-22 total score ≥ 30 at randomization.\n10. At least 70% compliance with INCS during the run-in period based on daily diary.\n11.

Any disorder, including but not limited to: cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, neurological, musculoskeletal, infectious, endocrine, metabolic, haematological, psychiatric, or major physical impairment that is not stable in the opinion of the Investigator or AstraZeneca and could:\n\n   * Affect the safety of the patient throughout the study;\n   * Influence the findings of the studies or their interpretations;\n   * Impede the patient's ability to complete the entire duration of study.\n5. Patients experiencing an asthma exacerbation requiring systemic (oral and/or parenteral) corticosteroids treatment or hospitalization (>24hrs) for treatment of asthma within 4 weeks prior to V1.\n6.

Current malignancy, or history of malignancy, except for: - Patients who have had basal cell carcinoma, localized squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or in situ carcinoma of the cervix are eligible provided that patient is in remission and curative therapy was completed at least 12 months prior to V1; - Patients who have had other malignancies are eligible provided that the patient is in remission and curative therapy was completed at least 5 years prior to V1.\n\n    NOTE: Hormonal therapy is allowed. As long as the cancer is in remission for 5 years, the patient is eligible.\n11. Any clinically significant cardiac disease or any electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormality obtained during the screening/run-in period, which may put the patient at risk or interfere with study assessments.\n12. Positive hepatitis B surface antigen, or hepatitis C virus antibody serology (confirmed by additional testing, e.g. hepatitis C RNA test, if indicated), or a positive medical history for hepatitis B or C (Note: Patients with history of hepatitis B vaccination without history of hepatitis B are allowed to enroll).\n13.
