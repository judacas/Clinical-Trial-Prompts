    "official_title": "A Phase 3, Multicenter, Randomized, Open-Label Study of Guadecitabine (SGI-110) Versus Treatment Choice in Adults With Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) or Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia (CMML) Previously Treated With Hypomethylating Agents",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Adult participants ≥18 years of age who are able to understand and comply with study procedures and provide written informed consent before any study-specific procedure.\n* Cytologically or histologically confirmed diagnosis of MDS or CMML according to the 2008 World Health Organization (WHO) classification.\n* Performance status (ECOG) of 0-2.\n* Previously treated MDS or CMML, defined as prior treatment with at least one hypomethylating agent (HMA; azacitidine and/or decitabine) for intermediate or high risk MDS or CMML whose disease progressed or relapsed as follows:\n\n  1. Participant received HMA for at least 6 cycles and was still transfusion dependent.\n  2. Participant received HMA for at least 2 complete cycles and had disease progression prior to Cycle 6 defined as\n\n  i. ≥50% increase in bone marrow blasts from pre-HMA-treatment levels or from nadir post-HMA-treatment levels to >5% (for participants with pretreatment or nadir blasts ≤5%) or to >10% (for participants with pretreatment or nadir blasts >5%), and/or ii. Transfusion dependent and ≥2 gram/deciliter (g/dL) reduction of Hgb from pre-HMA-treatment levels.\n\nOther prior treatments for MDS such as lenalidomide, cytarabine, intensive chemotherapy, hydroxyurea, erythropoietin and other growth factors, or hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) are allowed.\n\n* Participants must have either:\n\n  1. Bone marrow blasts >5% at randomization, OR\n  2. Transfusion dependence, defined as having had transfusion (in the setting of active disease) of 2 or more units of RBC or platelets within 8 weeks prior to randomization.\n* Creatinine clearance or glomerular filtration rate ≥30 milliliter/minute (mL/min) estimated by the Cockroft-Gault (C-G) or other medically acceptable formulas such as MDRD (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease) or CKD-EPI (the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration).\n* Women of childbearing potential must not be pregnant or breastfeeding and must have a negative pregnancy test at screening. Women of childbearing potential and men with female partners of childbearing potential must agree to practice 2 highly effective contraceptive measures of birth control and must agree not to become pregnant or father a child (a) while receiving treatment with guadecitabine and for at least 3 months after completing treatment and (b) while receiving treatment with LDAC or IC and for at least 6 months after completing treatment or for the duration specified in local prescribing information, whichever is longer.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Participants who have been diagnosed as having AML with peripheral blood or bone marrow blasts of ≥20%.\n* Participants who may still be sensitive to repeated treatment with decitabine or azacitidine such as participants who had response to prior decitabine or azacitidine treatment, but relapsed >6 months after stopping treatment with these agents.\n* Prior treatment with guadecitabine.\n* Hypersensitivity to decitabine, guadecitabine, or any of their excipients.\n* Second malignancy currently requiring active therapy, except breast or prostate cancer stable on or responding to endocrine therapy.\n* Treated with any investigational drug within 2 weeks of the first dose of study treatment.\n* Total serum bilirubin >2.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) (except for participants with Gilbert's Syndrome for whom direct bilirubin is <2.5×ULN), or liver cirrhosis or chronic liver disease Child-Pugh Class B or C.\n* Known active HIV, HBV, or HCV infection. Inactive hepatitis carrier status or low viral hepatitis titer on antivirals is allowed.\n* Known significant mental illness or other condition such as active alcohol or other substance abuse or addiction that, in the opinion of the investigator, predisposes the participant to high risk of noncompliance with the protocol.\n* Refractory congestive heart failure unresponsive to medical treatment, active infection resistant to all antibiotics, or advanced non-MDS associated pulmonary disease requiring >2 liters per minute oxygen.\n* Life expectancy of less than one month\n* Participants with TP53 mutations",
