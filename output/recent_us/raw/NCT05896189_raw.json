    "official_title": "An Open-Label Preoperative Pilot Study Evaluating Nivolumab (Anti-PD-1 Antibody) Alone Versus Nivolumab Plus Ipilimumab (Anti-CTLA-4 Antibody) in Patients With Resectable (HCC)",
    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Patients must give written informed consent prior to initiation of therapy, in keeping with the policies of the institution. Patients with a history of major psychiatric illness must be judged able to fully understand the investigational nature of the study and the risks associated with the therapy.\n\n   Target population\n2. Patients with histologically confirmed HCC (Documentation of original biopsy for diagnosis is acceptable if tumor tissue is unavailable) or clinical diagnosis by AASLD criteria in cirrhotic subjects is required (presence of arterial hypervascularity with venous washout). For subjects without cirrhosis, histological confirmation is mandatory. The determination of resectability status will ultimately lie in the clinical judgment of the surgical oncologist and medical oncologist involved in the care of the patient.\n3. Patient must have measurable disease defined as a lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) and measures ≥ 15 mm with conventional techniques or ≥ 10 mm with more sensitive techniques such as MRI or spiral CT scan.\n4. Patient can have had prior treatment for HCC including prior surgery, radiation therapy, local-regional therapy (abalation or arterial directed therapies), and systemic therapy including sorafenib or chemotherapy (but not anti-PD-1 or anti-CTLA-4 therapy)\n5. ECOG performance status ≤ 1.\n6. Within 14 days of the first dose of study drug, patients must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:\n\n   * Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/μL\n   * Platelets ≥100,000/μL\n   * Hgb > 9.0 g/dL (may be transfused or receive epoetin alfa [e.g., Epogen®] to maintain or exceed this level)\n   * Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dl\n   * Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 times the upper limit of normal or estimated CrCL >40mL/min.\n   * AST (SGOT) and/or ALT (SGPT) ≤ 5 X institutional upper limit of normal Age and Sex\n7. Men and women ≥ 18 years of age\n8. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 24 hours prior to the start of study drug.\n9. Women must not be breastfeeding\n10. WOCBP must agree to follow instructions for method(s) of contraception from the time of enrollment for the duration of treatment with study drug (s) plus 5 half-lives of study drug (s) plus 30 days (duration of ovulatory cycle) for a total of 5 months post treatment completion.\n11. Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must agree to follow instructions for method(s) of contraception for the duration of treatment with study drug (s) plus 5 half-lives of study drug (s) plus 90 days (duration of sperm turnover) for a total of 7 months post-treatment completion.\n12. Azoospermic males and WOCBP who are continuously not heterosexually active are exempt from contraceptive requirements. However, WOCBP must still undergo pregnancy testing as described in these sections.\n\nInvestigators shall counsel WOCBP and male subjects who are sexually active with WOCBP on the importance of pregnancy prevention and the implications of an unexpected pregnancy Investigators shall advise WOCBP and male subjects who are sexually active with WOCBP on the use of highly effective methods of contraception. Highly effective methods of contraception have a failure rate of < 1% per year when used consistently and correctly.\n\nAt a minimum, subjects must agree to the use of two methods of contraception, with one method being highly effective and the other method being either highly effective or less effective as listed below:\n\nHIGHLY EFFECTIVE METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION\n\n* Male condoms with spermicide\n* Hormonal methods of contraception including combined oral contraceptive pills, vaginal ring, injectables, implants, and intrauterine devices (IUDs) such as Mirena by WOCBP subject or male subject's WOCBP partner.\n* Nonhormonal IUDs, such as ParaGard\n* Tubal ligation\n* Vasectomy\n* Complete Abstinence* *Complete abstinence is defined as complete avoidance of heterosexual intercourse and is an acceptable form of contraception for all study drugs. Abstinence is only acceptable when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, profession of abstinence for entry into a clinical trial, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. Subjects who choose complete abstinence are not required to use a second method of contraception, but female subjects must continue to have pregnancy tests. Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective contraception must be discussed in the event that the subject chooses to forego complete abstinence.\n\nLESS EFFECTIVE METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION\n\n* Diaphragm with spermicide\n* Cervical cap with spermicide\n* Vaginal sponge\n* Male Condom without spermicide*\n* Progestin only pills by WOCBP subject or male subject's WOCBP partner\n* Female Condom* *A male and female condom must not be used together\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "Any of the following criteria will disqualify the patient from participation:\n\nTarget Disease Exceptions\n\n1.
