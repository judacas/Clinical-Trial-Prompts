The investigator should evaluate the potential for contraceptive method failure in relationship to the first dose of study treatment. A WOCBP must have a negative highly sensitive pregnancy test within either 24 hours (urine) or 72 hours (serum) before the first dose of study treatment. If a urine test cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test is required. The investigator is responsible for review of medical history, menstrual history, and recent sexual activity to decrease the risk for inclusion of a woman with an early undetected pregnancy. Contraceptive use by women should be consistent with local regulations regarding the methods of contraception for those participating in clinical studies\n* Has adequate organ function\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be FEMALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
