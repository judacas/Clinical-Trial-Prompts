Consumed grapefruit, grapefruit products, Seville oranges, or star fruit within 3 days prior to starting venetoclax 14. Malabsorption syndrome or other conditions that preclude enteral route of administration 15. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that in the opinion of the investigator may increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and/or would make the participants inappropriate for enrollment into this study",
