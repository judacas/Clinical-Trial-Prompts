An HIV test will not be required, however, previous medical history will be reviewed\n  * Presence of active or suspected acute or chronic uncontrolled infection\n  * History of, or current alcohol misuse/abuse in the 12 month period prior to screening\n* Female patients who are pregnant or lactating, or are of childbearing potential and not practicing a medically acceptable method of birth control. If a woman is participating in the trial then one form of contraception is sufficient (pill or diaphragm) and the partner should use a condom. If oral contraception is used in addition to condoms, the patient must have been practicing this method for at least two months prior to screening and must agree to continue the oral contraceptive throughout the course of the study and for 3 months after the study has ended. Male patients who are sexually active are required to use condoms during the study and for three months afterwards as a precautionary measure (available data do not suggest any increased reproductive risk with the study drugs)\n* Patients who have participated in any clinical investigation with an investigational drug within 1 month prior to screening or patients who have previously been treated with seliciclib\n* Patients with any ongoing or likely to require additional concomitant medical treatment to treat CD\n* Patients who have received pituitary irradiation within the last 5 years prior to the baseline visit\n* Patients who have been treated with radionuclide at any time prior to study entry\n* Patients with known hypersensitivity to seliciclib\n* Patients with a history of non-compliance to medical regimens or who are considered potentially unreliable or will be unable to complete the entire study\n* Patients with hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg) positivity\n* Patients with hepatitis C antibody (anti-HCV) positivity\n* Patients with prolonged QTcF on screening electrocardiogram (QTcF >450 msec)\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
