Receipt of any estrogen therapy within 14 days prior to study entry for persons on oral FHT, or within 30 days prior to entry for persons on injectable FHT.\n7. Known HIV-1 resistance mutations that would preclude remaining on current ART or a switch to a study regimen, in the opinion of the site investigator.\n8.
