    "inclusion_criteria": "* LEUKAPHERESIS: Diagnosis of metastatic solid tumor\n* LEUKAPHERESIS: Tissue confirmation of solid tumor. Confirmation of diagnosis must be or have been performed by internal pathology review of archival biopsy material or other pathologic material at Fred Hutch/University of Washington Cancer Consortium (UWMC)\n* LEUKAPHERESIS: HLA-A*11:01 confirmed through HLA typing at a clinically accredited laboratory\n* LEUKAPHERESIS: Previously documented KRASG12V mutation in tumor or plasma cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid (cfDNA) specimens by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or next-generation sequencing (NGS) test\n* LEUKAPHERESIS: Measurable disease by RECIST 1.1 criteria: Participants must have measurable disease, defined as at least one target lesion that can be measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥ 10 mm, unless lymph node in which case short axis must be ≥ 15 mm. Baseline imaging (for example, diagnostic CT chest/abdomen/pelvis and imaging of the affected extremity as appropriate), brain imaging (MRI or CT scan) if clinically indicated, must be obtained within 8 weeks of the first planned T cell infusion.

Should there be no tumor tissue that is accessible for biopsy, subjects will still be considered for participation, at the discretion of the investigator.
