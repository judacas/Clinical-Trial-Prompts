    "official_title": "A Phase 2, Single-Arm, Multi-center Study of 177Lu-PSMA (177Lu-PNT2002) in Patients With PSMA-Positive Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Histologic confirmation of ACC (primary or metastatic tumor). Central review not required but local pathology review required (at Johns Hopkins or Stanford).\n* Patients must have recurrent or metastatic ACC with measurable disease per RECIST 1.1, not amenable to definitive surgery or radiotherapy.\n* Patients must have at least 1 lesion positive on PSMA-PET, as defined by standard uptake value (SUV) ratio of tumor to liver greater than one.\n* Patient can have any or no prior systemic therapies.\n* At least 28 days must have elapsed between last anti-cancer treatment administration and the initiation of study treatment, or at least 5 half-lives of the prior systemic therapy must have elapsed (whichever is shorter).\n* Patient must have resolution of all previous treatment related toxicities to CTCAE version 5.0 grade of ≤ 2.\n* Patient must be ≥ 18 years of age.\n* Patient must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 2.\n\nFor female patients with childbearing potential or male patients with partners of childbearing potential, agreement to use barrier contraceptive method (condom) and to continue its use for 6 months from receiving the last dose of 177Lu-PSMA. Female patients with childbearing potential will undergo a urine pregnancy test. Pregnant female participants are excluded.\n\n* Patient must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Spinal cord compression or impending spinal cord compression.\n* Suspected pulmonary and/or liver metastases (greater >10 mm in largest axis).\n* Unable to lie flat during or tolerate PET/CT.\n* Refusal to sign informed consent.\n* Any medical comorbidities that might preclude safe participation in the study.\n\nAdditional inclusion criteria only relevant if Cohort 2 participants enrolled:\n\n* Adequate bone marrow reserve and organ function as demonstrated by complete blood count and chemistry panel completed within the prior 28 days demonstrating:\n\n  1. Platelet count of >100 x109/L\n  2. White blood cell (WBC) count > 3,000/mL\n  3. Neutrophil count of > 1,500/mL\n  4. Hemoglobin ≥ 10 g/dL\n  5. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) > 50 mL/min based upon Chronic Kidney Disease- Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation. Due to safety concerns relating to renal clearance and toxicity of 177Lu-PSMA, patients with estimated GFR between 50 - 60 mL/min will require a 99mTc-TPA GFR test and only patients with non-obstructive pathology will be included in the study.\n  6. Aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤5 x upper limit of normal (ULN), total bilirubin < 3 x ULN\n  7. Total bilirubin < 3 x ULN (except if confirmed history of Gilbert's disease)\n  8. Serum albumin > 30 g/L\n\nAdditional exclusion criteria only relevant if Cohort 2 participants enrolled:\n\n* Inadequate bone marrow reserve and organ function as detailed in eligibility criteria.\n* Patient is participating in a concurrent investigative treatment protocol involving radiotherapy, surgery, or systemic anti-cancer agents.\n* Patient receiving any other investigational agents.",
