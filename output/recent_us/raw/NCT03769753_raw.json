    "exclusion_criteria": "* Prior radical prostatectomy or definitive radiotherapy with therapeutic intent for prostate cancer. Palliative radiotherapy is allowed providing any wide field radiation therapy is completed more than 4 weeks before the start of study treatment\n* Major surgery (excluding placement of vascular access, transurethral resection of prostate, bilateral orchiectomy, or internal stents) within 4 weeks of the start of study treatment\n* Brain metastases, or spinal cord compression (unless spinal cord compression is asymptomatic, treated and stable and not requiring steroids for at least 4 weeks prior to start of study treatment)\n* Past medical history of interstitial lung disease, drug-induced interstitial lung disease, radiation pneumonitis which required steroid treatment, or any evidence of clinically active interstitial lung disease\n* Any of the following cardiac criteria:\n\n  i. Mean resting corrected QT interval (QTc) > 470 msec obtained from triplicate ECGs ii. History of QT prolongation associated with other medications that required discontinuation of that medication.\n\niii. Family history of long QT syndrome, or unexplained sudden death under 40 years of age in first-degree relatives.\n\niv. Medical history significant for arrhythmia which is symptomatic or requires treatment, symptomatic or uncontrolled atrial fibrillation despite treatment, or asymptomatic sustained ventricular tachycardia.\n\nv. Any clinically important abnormalities in conduction or morphology of resting ECG (eg, complete left bundle branch block, third-degree heart block) vi. Any factors that increase the risk of QTc prolongation or risk of arrhythmic events such as hypokalaemia, potential for torsades de pointes, congenital long QT syndrome, or any concomitant medication known to significantly prolong the QT interval vii. Experience of any of the following procedures or conditions in the preceding 3 months: coronary artery bypass graft, angioplasty, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris.\n\nviii. Congestive heart failure NYHA Grade ≥ 2 ix. Symptomatic hypotension - systolic blood pressure (SBP) <90 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) <50 mmHg x. Uncontrolled hypertension (SBP ≥ 160 mmHg or DBP ≥ 95 mmHg).\n\n* Clinically significant abnormalities of glucose metabolism as defined by any of the following:\n\n  i. Patients with diabetes mellitus type 1 or diabetes mellitus type 2 requiring insulin treatment ii. HbA1c ≥8.0% (63.9 mmol/mol)\n* Inadequate bone marrow reserve or organ function as demonstrated by any of the following laboratory values:\n\n  i. Absolute neutrophil count < 1.5x 10^9/L ii. Platelet count < 100x 10^9/L iii. Haemoglobin < 9 g/dL (< 5.59 mmol/L) iv. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) > 2.5x upper limit of normal (ULN) if no demonstrable liver metastases or > 5x ULN in the presence of liver metastases. Elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is not exclusionary if due to the presence of bone metastases and liver function is otherwise considered adequate in the investigator's judgement v. Total bilirubin > 1.5x ULN (participants with confirmed Gilbert's syndrome may be included in the study with a higher value) vi. Creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min (measured or calculated by Cockcroft and Gault equation)\n* As judged by the investigator, any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic diseases, including active bleeding diatheses, or known active infection including hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV\n* unevaluable for both bone and soft tissue progression as defined by meeting both of the following criteria: i. a \"superscan\" of bone scan, and ii. no soft tissue lesion that can be assessed by RECIST criteria\n* Refractory nausea and vomiting, malabsorption syndrome, chronic gastrointestinal diseases, inability to swallow the formulated product or previous significant bowel resection, or other condition that would preclude adequate absorption of capivasertib\n* Any other disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding that, in the investigator's opinion, gives reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that contra-indicates the use of an investigational drug, may affect the interpretation of the results, render the patient at high risk from treatment complications or interferes with obtaining informed consent\n* Evidence of dementia, altered mental status, or any psychiatric condition that would prohibit understanding or rendering of informed consent\n* Previous allogeneic bone marrow transplant or solid organ transplant\n* History of another primary malignancy except for malignancy treated with curative intent with no known active disease ≥ 2 years before the first dose of study intervention and of low potential risk for recurrence. Exceptions include adequately resected non-melanoma skin cancer and curatively treated in situ disease.\n* Treatment with any of the following:\n\n  i.

Any other chemotherapy, immunotherapy, immunosuppressant medication (other than corticosteroids) or anticancer agents within 3 weeks of the first dose of study treatment. A longer washout may be required for drugs with a long half-life (eg, biologics) iv. Strong inhibitors or strong inducers of CYP3A4 within 2 weeks before the start of study treatment (3 weeks for St John's wort). Note that adequate washout or dose reduction may be required for some CYP3A substrates prior to initiating Capivasertib dosing.\n* Drugs known to significantly prolong the QT interval and associated with Torsades de Pointes within 5 half-lives of the first dose of study treatment\n* Participation in another clinical study with an investigational product administered in the last 30 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer.\n* History of hypersensitivity to active or inactive excipients of capivasertib, abiraterone, or drugs with a similar chemical structure or class.\n* Involvement in the planning and/or conduct of the study (applies to both AstraZeneca staff and/or staff at the study site).\n* Judgment by the investigator that the patient should not participate in the study if the patient is unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions and requirements.\n* Any restriction or contraindication based on the local prescribing information that would prohibit the use of abiraterone.",
