Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must have a negative serum pregnancy test and must either practice complete abstinence or agree to use a highly effective method of contraception.\n12. Male subjects must have had a successful vasectomy OR must either practice complete abstinence or agree to use a latex or synthetic condom during sexual contact with a female of childbearing potential (FCBP) during study treatment (including during dose interruptions), and for 3 months after study drug discontinuation.\n\n    NOTE: Male subjects must not donate sperm during study treatment (including during dose interruptions), and for 3 months after study drug discontinuation.\n13.

Uncontrolled concurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n6.
