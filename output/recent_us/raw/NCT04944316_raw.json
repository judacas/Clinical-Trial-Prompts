Lesions situated in a previously irradiated area are considered measurable if progression has been demonstrated in such lesions.\n* Participant consents to provide a tumor specimen in a tissue block or unstained serial slides obtained within 56 days prior to first dose of IP. If a recent tissue sample cannot be provided due to medical or safety concerns, enrollment into the study must be discussed with the medical monitor.\n* Participant consents to undergoing a tumor biopsy (core tissue biopsy or excision) during the treatment period as indicated in the schedule of assessments if predose biopsy is available and if medically feasible.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Participant weighs < 45 kg at screening.\n* Participant has received investigational therapy (other than an investigational EGFR TKI in a participant with EGFR activating mutations or ALK or BRAF inhibitor in a participant with an ALK mutation) within 21 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter, prior to start of IP.\n* Participant requires or has received systemic steroid therapy or any other immunosuppressive therapy within 14 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1. Participants using a physiologic replacement dose of hydrocortisone or its equivalent (defined as up to 30 mg per day of hydrocortisone up to 10 mg per day of prednisone) are allowed.\n* Participant has symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastases or participant has evidence of unstable CNS metastases even if asymptomatic (e.g., progression on scans). Participants with previously treated CNS metastases are eligible, if they are clinically stable and have no evidence of CNS progression by imaging for at least 4 weeks prior to start of IP and are not requiring immunosuppressive doses of systemic steroids (> 30 mg per day of hydrocortisone or > 10 mg per day of prednisone or equivalent) for longer than 2 weeks.\n* Participant has an active autoimmune disease. Participants with type 1 diabetes mellitus, endocrinopathies stably maintained on appropriate replacement therapy or skin disorders (e.g., vitiligo, psoriasis or alopecia) not requiring systemic treatment are allowed.\n* Participant was discontinued from prior immunomodulatory therapy due to a grade ≥ 3 toxicity that was mechanistically related (e.g., immune related) to the agent.\n* Participant has known history of serious hypersensitivity reaction to a known ingredient of ASP7517 or pembrolizumab or severe hypersensitivity reaction to treatment with another monoclonal antibody.\n* Participant has a known history of human immunodeficiency virus.\n* Participant with known history of positive hepatitis B surface antigen or isolated hepatitis B core antibody (including acute HBV or chronic HBV) or hepatitis C ([HCV] ribonucleic acid [RNA] detected by qualitative assay). Hepatitis C RNA testing is not required in participants with negative hepatitis C antibody testing.\n* Participant has received a live vaccine against infectious diseases within 28 days prior to initiation of IP.\n* Participant has a history of drug-induced pneumonitis (interstitial lung disease), a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids, radiation pneumonitis or currently has pneumonitis.\n* Participant has an infection requiring systemic therapy within 14 days prior to IP.\n* Participant has received a prior allogeneic bone marrow or solid organ transplant.\n* Participant is expected to require another form of antineoplastic therapy while on IP.\n* Participant has had a myocardial infarction or unstable angina within 6 months prior to the start of IP or currently has an uncontrolled illness including, but not limited to symptomatic congestive heart failure, clinically significant cardiac disease, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* Participant has a clinically significant abnormal electrocardiogram at screening.\n* Participant has symptomatic cardiovascular disease within the preceding 12 months unless cardiology consultation and clearance has been obtained for study participation, including but not limited to the following: significant coronary artery disease (e.g., requiring angioplasty or stenting), acute myocardial infarction or unstable angina pectoris < 3 months prior screening, uncontrolled hypertension, clinically significant arrhythmia or congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association grade ≥ 3).\n* Any condition that makes the participant unsuitable for study participation.\n* Participant has had a major surgical procedure and has not completely recovered within 28 days prior to the start of IP.\n* Participant has a prior malignancy active (i.e., requiring treatment of intervention) within the previous 2 years prior to the screening visit, except for locally curable malignancies that have been apparently cured, such as basal or squamous cell skin cancer, superficial bladder cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix or breast.
