ANC (absolute neutrophil count ) ≥ 1.0 × 109/L.\n   2. Hemoglobin ≥ 8.0 g/dL.\n   3. Platelet count ≥ 50 × 109/L.\n   4. Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × ULN (upper limit of normal ). Subjects with documented history of Gilbert's syndrome and in whom total bilirubin elevations are accompanied by elevated indirect bilirubin are eligible.\n   5. ALT(alanine aminotransferase) /AST (aspartate aminotransferase ) ≤ 3.0 ULN or ≤ 5 × ULN in the presence of liver involvement by lymphoma.\n   6. Calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 45 mL/min by the Cockcroft-Gault Equation70 or the estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥ 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula.\n10.

Woman of childbearing potential who has a negative serum pregnancy test at screening and who agrees to take appropriate precautions to avoid pregnancy (with at least 99% certainty) from screening through safety follow-up at least 9 months after the last dose of loncastuximab tesirine. Permitted methods that are at least 99% effective in preventing pregnancy should be communicated to the subject and their understanding confirmed.\n11. Man, who agrees to take appropriate precautions to avoid fathering children (with at least 99% certainty) from screening through at least 6 months after the last dose of study treatment.
