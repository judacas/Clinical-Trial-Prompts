Participants must have progressed on\n\n  * If applicable, an immune checkpoint inhibitor.\n  * If applicable, appropriate available therapies, including HER2-directed therapies.\n\nParticipants who are considered ineligible for or are intolerant of standard therapy per investigator are eligible.\n\n* For Part 4 only - Participants with history of advanced histopathologically or cytologically confirmed colorectal cancer (CRC) that does not harbor the BRAF V600E mutation and are not dMMR+/MSI-Hi with progression on:\n\n  * A fluoropyrimidine (e.g., 5-fluorouracil or capecitabine).\n  * Oxaliplatin.\n  * Irinotecan.\n  * If applicable, anti-EGFR (including, but not limited to cetuximab or panitumumab).\n  * If applicable, anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) monoclonal antibody (including but not limited to bevacizumab, ramucirumab, or aflibercept).\n  * If applicable, targeted therapy\n  * Participants who are considered ineligible for or are intolerant of standard therapy per investigator are eligible. Prior trifluridine/tipiracil (TAS-102) or Regorafenib treated participants are eligible.\n* For Part 5 only - participants with advanced histologically or cytologically confirmed solid tumors characterized by MET amplification who are not amenable to surgical resection and who have disease progression after at least one prior systemic therapy and/or who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options. Participants who are intolerant to standard treatment are eligible.\n\nFor Part 6 only - Participants with advanced histologically or cytologically confirmed solid tumors harboring MET mutations including: mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain, the juxtamembrane region and the extracellular domain (as locally determined by next-generation sequencing (NGS) or a validated qPCR on tissue), who are not amenable to surgical resection and who have disease progression after at least one prior systemic therapy and/or who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options.\n\n* Intolerant to the standard treatment are eligible\n* For Part 7 (CRC combination) only: Participants with history of advanced histopathologically or cytologically confirmed CRC that does not harbor the mutation and are not dMMR+/MSI-H with progression on:\n\n  * A fluoropyrimidine (e.g., 5-fluorouracil or capecitabine)\n  * Oxaliplatin\n  * Irinotecan\n  * If applicable, anti-EGFR (including, but not limited to cetuximab or panitumumab)\n  * If applicable, anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) monoclonal antibody (including but not limited to bevacizumab, ramucirumab, or aflibercept)\n  * If applicable, targeted therapy Participants who are considered ineligible for or are intolerant of standard therapy per investigator are eligible. Participants treated previously with TAS-102 or regorafenib are not eligible.\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0 or 1.\n* Laboratory values meeting the criteria outlined in the protocol.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* History of interstitial lung disease (ILD) or pneumonitis that required treatment with systemic steroids, nor any evidence of active ILD or on screening chest CT scan..\n* History of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, organizing pneumonia (e.g., bronchiolitis obliterans), drug-induced pneumonitis, or idiopathic pneumonitis.\n* History of clinically significant, intercurrent lung-specific illnesses, as noted in the protocol.\n* For Part 7 only: Prior TAS-102 or regorafenib treated participants are not eligible.",
