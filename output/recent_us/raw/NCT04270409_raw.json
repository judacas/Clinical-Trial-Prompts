    "inclusion_criteria": "Healthy volunteers allowed\nMust have maximum age of 21 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Known primary immunodeficiency\n* History of HIV infection\n* Severe intercurrent uncontrolled bacterial, viral or fungal infection (e.g. active hepatitis B or C infection or adenovirus infection)\n* History of hypersensitivity reactions to murine protein-containing products\n* Patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL, t (15;17))\n* Known contraindication to the protocol defined lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimen of fludarabine/cyclophosphamide.\n\nInclusion Criteria for Treatment:\n\n* Age≤21 years old\n* Detectable disease that is CD123+ (at least MRD+ disease)\n* Estimated life expectancy of >8 weeks\n* Karnofsky or Lansky (age-dependent) performance score≥50\n* Patients with a history of prior allogeneic HCT must be clinically recovered from prior HCT therapy, have no evidence of active GVHD and have not received a donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) within the 28 days prior to planned infusion\n* Patient must have an identified, suitable HCT donor\n* Adequate cardiac function defined as left ventricular ejection fraction >40%, OR shortening fraction ≥25%\n* EKG without evidence of clinically significant arrhythmia\n* Adequate renal function defined as creatinine clearance or radioisotope GFR ≥50 ml/min/1.73m2 (GFR ≥40 ml/min/1.73m2 if < 2 years of age)\n* Adequate pulmonary function defined as forced vital capacity (FVC)≥50% of predicted value; or pulse oximetry≥92% on room air if patient is unable to perform pulmonary function testing\n* Total Bilirubin≤3 times the upper limit of normal for age, except in subjects with Gilbert's syndrome\n* Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) OR aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤5 times the upper limit of normal for age\n* Has recovered from all NCI CTAE grade III-IV, non-hematologic acute toxicities from prior therapy\n* For females of child-bearing age\n\n  * Not lactating with intent to breastfeed\n  * Not pregnant with negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to enrollment\n* If sexually active, agreement to use birth control until 3 months after T- cell infusion. Male partners should use a condom.\n* Available autologous transduced T-cell product that has met GMP release criteria\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Known primary immunodeficiency\n* History of HIV infection\n* Severe intercurrent uncontrolled bacterial, viral or fungal infection\n* History of hypersensitivity reactions to murine protein-containing products\n* History of severe hypersensitivity reactions to cornstarch or hydroxyethyl starch.\n* Receiving systemic steroids therapy exceeding the equivalent of 0.5 mg/kg/day of methylprednisolone, in the 7 days prior to CD123-CAR T- cell infusion\n* Receiving systemic therapy in the 14 days prior to CD123-CAR T-cell infusion, which will interfere with the activity of the CD123-CAR T cells in vivo (in the opinion of the study PI(s))\n* Receiving rituximab therapy in the 30 days prior to CD123-CAR T cell infusion. (This exclusion criterion is intended to prevent premature exposure of CD123-CAR T cells to rituximab, which would activate the safety switch and promote CAR T-cell apoptosis).\n* Receiving intrathecal chemotherapy in the 7 days prior to CD123-CAR T cell infusion.\n* Known contraindication to the protocol defined lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimen of fludarabine/cyclophosphamide.\n* Active CNS disease",
