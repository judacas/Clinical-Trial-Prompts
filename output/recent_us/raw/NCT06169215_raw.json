    "exclusion_criteria": "* Actively receiving cancer directed, systemic therapy\n* Prior systemic treatment for pancreatic adenocarcinoma within 2 weeks of first study treatment\n* Known active auto-immune disease or immunodeficiency requiring systemic steroid equivalent to prednisone >= 10 mg/day or immunosuppressive therapy within 14 days or 5 half-lives prior to first dose of trial therapy\n* History of non-infectious pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease\n* Active infection requiring systemic therapy defined as ongoing signs/symptoms related to the infection without improvement despite appropriate antibiotics, antiviral therapy, and/or other treatment\n* Pregnant or lactating women\n* Live attenuated vaccine received =< 30 days before first dose of trial therapy\n* Known history of positive test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or known acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)\n* Contraindications to radiotherapy including but not limited to radiation sensitivity syndromes e.g., xeroderma pigmentosum, ataxia telangiectasia\n* Any significant medical condition including additional active malignancies, laboratory abnormalities, or psychiatric illness that would prevent the subject from participating and adhering to study related procedures in the view of the principal investigator",
