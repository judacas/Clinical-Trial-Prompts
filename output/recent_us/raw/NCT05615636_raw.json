    "official_title": "Phase 1/2b Trial of Autologous Humanized CD19-Directed Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-Cells Manufactured Using the CliniMACS Prodigy Platform for the Treatment of Pediatric B Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (B-ALL)",
    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Signed Informed Informed Consent\n2. Subjects with documented CD19+ ALL or Lly:\n\n   1. Cohort A: Subjects with relapsed or refractory ALL or Lly\n   2. Cohort B: Subjects with poor response to prior B cell directed engineered cell therapy,\n3. Subjects with prior or current history of CNS3 disease will be eligible if Central Nervous System (CNS) disease is responsive to therapy (at infusion, must meet criteria in Section 7.6.2).\n4. Documentation of CD19 tumor expression in bone marrow, peripheral blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), or tumor tissue by flow cytometry. If the subject has received CD19-directed therapy, flow cytometry should be obtained after this therapy to demonstrate CD19 expression.\n5. Age 0-29 years\n6. Adequate organ function\n7. Adequate performance status defined as Lanksy or Karnofsky performance score â‰¥50\n8. Subjects of reproductive potential must agree to use acceptable birth control methods.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 0 Years\nMust have maximum age of 29 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Active hepatitis B or active hepatitis C\n2. HIV infection\n3. Active acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) requiring systemic therapy.\n4. Concurrent use of systemic steroids or immunosuppression at the time of cell infusion or cell collection, or a condition, in the treating physician's opinion, that is likely to require steroid therapy or immunosuppression during collection or after infusion. Steroids for disease treatment at times other than cell collection or at the time of infusion are permitted. Use of physiologic replacement hydrocortisone or inhaled steroids is permitted as well.\n5. CNS disease that is progressive on therapy, or with CNS parenchymal lesions that might increase the risk of CNS toxicity.\n6. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women.\n7. Uncontrolled active infection.\n8. History of seizure disorder that requires ongoing anti-epileptic therapy.\n9. If the subject has received previous CAR T cell therapies, history of grade 3 or higher ICANS following administration of a CAR T cell product.",
