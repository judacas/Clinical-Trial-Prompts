Arm A (treatment naïve): Patients who are newly diagnosed and treatment naïve. Patient who underwent curative intent chemotherapy and/radiation in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting are allowed to enroll if tumor recurrence occurred greater than 6 months from completion of therapy. Patients with NSCLC tumor known to harbor a genomic aberration for which FDA approved treatment is available (i.e, non-resistant EGFR mutations, EGFR T790M mutation, ALK rearrangement, ROS rearrangement, BRAF V600E mutation) are allowed to enroll if they have received prior treatment with the FDA approved targeted therapy.\n  * B.)

This will not apply to patients with confirmed Gilbert's syndrome (persistent or recurrent hyperbilirubinemia that is predominantly unconjugated in the absence of hemolysis or hepatic pathology), who will be allowed only in consultation with their physician.\n  * Serum creatinine CL ≤ 1.5 X ULN or creatinine clearance > 45 mL/min by the Cockcroft-Gault formula (Cockcroft and Gault 1976) or by 24-hour urine collection for determination of creatinine clearance.\n* Have archival tissue where available.\n* In addition, patients enrolled on the clinical trial must be willing and able to provide tissue from a newly obtained core or excisional biopsy of a tumor lesion. Patients for whom newly obtained samples cannot be provided may submit an archived specimen only upon agreement from the Sponsor.\n* Female participants of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum pregnancy within 72 hours before receiving the first dose of study medication. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required.\n* Ability to understand and willingness to provide written informed consent signed and dated prior to admission to the study in accordance with International Conference on Harmonisation-Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP) guidelines and to the local legislation.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
