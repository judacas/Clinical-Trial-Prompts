    "exclusion_criteria": "* Presence of extensive or multifocal metastatic extrahepatic or peritoneal disease. Clinical or radiographic evidence of metastatic disease to regional lymph nodes will be allowed, as will limited pulmonary disease at the discretion of the OHSU PI\n* Prior treatment with floxuridine, oxaliplatin, or irinotecan\n* Prior treatment with hepatic arterial infusion therapy\n* Known to have experienced an allergic reaction or other signs of intolerance to implanted devices\n* Body size that is insufficient to accommodate the physical size of the pump\n* Diagnosis of sclerosing cholangitis\n* Diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy\n* Clinical evidence of portal hypertension (ascites, gastroesophageal varices, or portal vein thrombosis) or hepatic venous wedge pressures > 8 mmHg if available\n* History of multiple abdominal operations that would preclude HAI pump placement\n* Active infection\n* Current biliary obstruction requiring placement of endoscopic or transhepatic stents for biliary decompression\n* Presence of aberrant or replaced hepatic arterial anatomy not amenable to placement of a hepatic arterial infusion pump catheter as judged by the operating surgeon\n* History of peripheral neuropathy > grade 1\n* Allergies to iodine contrast medium, that cannot be premedicated with steroids per institutional radiology guidelines (e.g., dexamethasone)\n* Uncontrolled severe coagulation disorders (INR > 1.5 in patients not on warfarin therapy)\n* Pregnant or lactating women\n* History of malignancy other than cholangiocarcinoma within 5 years prior to screening, with the exception of:\n\n  * Malignancies with a negligible risk of metastasis or death (e.g., 5-year overall survival [OS] rate > 90%), such as adequately treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix, non-melanoma skin carcinoma, melanoma in situ, localized prostate cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ, or\n  * Stage I uterine cancer or a malignancy whose natural history or treatment has, in the opinion of the principal investigator, the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the intervention under investigation\n* Life expectancy =< 12 weeks\n* Inability to comply with study and/or follow-up procedures\n* Emotional or psychiatric problems that would preclude successful participation in the hepatic arterial infusion program as judged by the one of the study investigators, and further corroborated by the mandatory interview and assessment with medical oncology social worker\n* EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR TREATMENT PERIOD 2\n* Participants with radiographic evidence of extrahepatic disease\n* Evidence of extrahepatic disease found at laparoscopy during open surgical exploration for HAI pump implantation.
