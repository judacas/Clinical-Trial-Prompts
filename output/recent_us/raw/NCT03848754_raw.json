Inhaled or topical steroids, and adrenal replacement steroid doses > 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent, are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease\n* Prior allogeneic organ transplantation\n* Surgical intervention within 4 weeks prior to study treatment, except for minor procedures such as port placement or biopsies\n* Concurrent malignancy other than the diagnosis of rectal cancer, with the exception of curatively resected non-melanoma skin cancer, cervical cancer in situ, prostate cancer Gleason 6 or below that is localized to the prostate, or any other curatively resected cancer from which the patient remains in remission for at least 2 years without treatment\n* Unstable cardiac disease as defined by one of the following:\n\n  * Cardiac events such as myocardial infarction (MI) within the past 6 months\n  * NYHA (New York Heart Association) heart failure class III-IV\n  * Uncontrolled atrial fibrillation\n* Clinically significant uncontrolled illness\n* Females only: Pregnant or breastfeeding\n* Prior allergic reaction or hypersensitivity to any of the study drug components\n* Active autoimmune disease or history of autoimmune disease that required systemic treatment within 2 years before starting treatment, i.e., with use of disease-modifying agents or immunosuppressive drugs (excluding hypothyroidism, vitiligo, and psoriasis that is controlled with topical management)\n* History of acute thrombotic venous events in the last 30 days before enrollment. If within 30 days, the patient should be on anticoagulants and without symptoms\n* Any evidence of current interstitial lung disease (ILD) or pneumonitis or a prior history of ILD or non-infectious pneumonitis requiring high-dose glucocorticoids\n* Psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the study\n* History or current evidence of any condition, co-morbidity, therapy, any active infections (requiring antibiotics), or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the patient's participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of the patient to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator\n* Known previous severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection within 10 days for mild or asymptomatic infections or 20 days for severe/critical illness prior to cycle 1 day 1 (C1D1)\n* Uncontrolled infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
