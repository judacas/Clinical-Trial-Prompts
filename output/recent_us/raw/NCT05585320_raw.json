    "official_title": "A Phase 3, Randomized Study Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of TAR-210 Erdafitinib Intravesical Delivery System Versus Single Agent Intravesical Chemotherapy in Participants With Intermediate-risk Non-muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer (IR-NMIBC) and Susceptible FGFR Alterations",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Have a histologically confirmed diagnosis (within 90 days of randomization) of IR-NMIBC with at least one of the following criteria fulfilled: a. Ta low grade (LG)/ Grade 1 (G1): primary or recurrent, b. Ta LG/G2: primary or recurrent and c. Greater than or equal to (>=) 1 of the following risk factors: i. Multiple Ta LG tumors, ii. Solitary LG tumor >= 3 cm, iii. Early recurrence (less than [<] 1 year), iv. Frequent recurrence (greater than [>] 1 per year), v. Recurrence after prior adjuvant intravesical treatment (single perioperative dose of chemotherapy does not fulfill this risk factor)\n* Have a susceptible fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) mutation or fusion either by urine testing or tumor tissue testing (from TURBT tissue), as determined by central or local testing\n* Participants must be willing to undergo all study procedures (e.g., multiple cystoscopies from Screening through the end of study and TURBT for assessment of recurrence/progression) and receive the assigned treatment, including intravesical chemotherapy if randomized into that arm.\n* Visible papillary disease must be fully resected prior to randomization and absence of disease must be documented at Screening cystoscopy\n* Can have a prior or concurrent second malignancy (other than the disease under study) which natural history or treatment is unlikely to interfere with any study endpoints of safety or the efficacy of the study treatment\n* Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 2\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to any study component or its excipients, including: a. Erdafitinib excipients; b.TAR-210 drug delivery system constituent materials ; c. urinary placement catheter materials; d. MMC or chemically related drugs; e. Gemcitabine or chemically related drugs\n* Presence of any bladder or urethral anatomic feature (that is, urethral stricture) that, in the opinion of the investigator, may prevent the safe insertion, indwelling use, removal of TAR-210 or passage of a urethral catheter for intravesical chemotherapy\n* Polyuria with recorded 24-hour urine volumes > 4000 milliliters (mL)\n* Current indwelling urinary catheters, however, intermittent catheterization is acceptable\n* Had major surgery or had significant traumatic injury and/or not fully recovered within 4 weeks before first dose (TURBT is not considered major surgery)",
