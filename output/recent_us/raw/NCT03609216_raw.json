In dose expansion Cohort 2, patients must have histology documented locally advanced or metastatic HER2-negative/HER2-low breast cancer (IHC 0, IHC 1, or IHC 2+/ in situ hybridization negative) breast cancer. Participants should have received at least one prior line of therapy in the advanced setting. Participants with metastatic TNBC that is PD-L1 positive will be expected to have prior immunotherapy unless contraindicated. Participants with HR-positive disease will be expected to have received a prior cyclin- dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor in the metastatic or adjuvant setting.\n6.

WOCBP must have a negative urine pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to the start of lymphodepleting chemotherapy. If a WOCBP has a urine pregnancy test that cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum (beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [β-hCG]) pregnancy test will be required.\n12. Participants must have measurable disease per the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 (Appendix 3).\n13. Participants must have adequate organ function as defined below within 10 days prior to the start of lymphodepleting chemotherapy:\n\n    Table 1. Adequate Organ Function Laboratory Values Systemic Function Test Laboratory Value Hematologic ANC ≥1500/µL Platelets ≥100,000/µL Hemoglobin ≥9.0 g/dLa Renal Creatinine OR CrCl by Cockcroft-Gault formula ≤1.5 × ULNb\n\n    ≥45 mL/min for patients with creatinine >1.5 × ULNb Hepatic Total bilirubin ≤1.5 × ULN OR direct bilirubin ≤ ULN for patients with total bilirubin levels >1.5 × ULN AST and ALT ≤2.5 × ULN (≤5 × ULN for patients with liver metastases) Coagulation PT/INR aPTT ≤1.5 × ULN unless participant is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or aPTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants\n\n    ALT=alanine aminotransferase; ANC=absolute neutrophil count; aPTT=activated partial thromboplastin time; AST=aspartate aminotransferase; CrCl=creatinine clearance; INR=international normalized ratio; PT=prothrombin time; ULN=upper limit of normal.\n    1. Criteria must be met without erythropoietin dependency and without packed red blood cell transfusion within last 2 weeks of the screening test. Participants may be on a stable dose of erythropoietin (≥ approximately 3 months).\n    2. Serum creatinine and CrCl should be interpreted and calculated per institutional standard.\n14. Left ventricular ejection fraction >50%.\n15. Adequate respiratory reserve defined as dyspnea Grade 0 or 1 and saturated oxygen >92% in room air.\n16. Prior treatment with TROP2-targeted therapy will be allowed.\n17. Willing to undergo mandatory blood collections and biopsies as required by the study.\n18. Willing to sign consent for long-term follow-up on protocol PA17-0483.\n19. Willing to stay within a 2-hour drive (approximately 100-mile radius) of the study site during the first 2 weeks after the TROP2-NK cell infusion.\n\nExclusion Criteria\n\nParticipants who meet any of the following criteria will not be eligible:\n\n1. Pregnant, breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive within the projected duration of the study, starting with the screening visit through 6 months post TROP2-CAR-NK cell infusion.\n2. Has received systemic anticancer therapy within 2 weeks or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter, prior to the start of lymphodepleting chemotherapy. For participants treated with monoclonal antibodies, at least 3 weeks must have elapsed prior to the start of lymphodepleting chemotherapy. Participants who have entered the follow-up phase of an investigational study may participate as long as it has been 3 weeks after the last dose of the previous investigational agent.\n3. Participants must have recovered from all AEs due to previous therapies to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline. Participants with ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy, alopecia, or other non-relevant AEs may be deemed eligible at the discretion of the principal investigator (PI)/co-PIs. If a participant received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to the start of lymphodepleting chemotherapy.\n4. Has received prior radiotherapy within 2 weeks of the start of lymphodepleting chemotherapy.

A 1-week washout is permitted for palliative radiation (≤2 weeks of radiotherapy) to non-CNS disease.\n5.

Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster (chicken pox), yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus Calmette-Guérin, and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza and COVID- 19 vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., FluMist®) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.\n6.

Patients with previously treated brain metastases may participate if they completed radiation therapy, are clinically stable, and without requirement of steroid treatment for at least 2 weeks prior to study enrollment.\n10.

Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is allowed.\n11. History of interstitial lung disease (ILD) that required steroids or has current pneumonitis/ILD.\n12. Active infection requiring systemic therapy.\n13. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.\n14. Known active or chronic hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus infection.\n15. Known history of active tuberculosis (Mycobacterium Tuberculosis).\n16. History or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the participant's participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of the patient to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.\n17.
