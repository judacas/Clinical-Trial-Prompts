Sites include all oral cavity as well as oropharyngeal dysplasia that is accessible in the outpatient clinic.\n2.

History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical composition to Curcumin (turmeric).\n9. Active or chronic liver disease, evidence of hepatitis (infectious or autoimmune), cirrhosis or portal hypertension. Exceptions to this Exclusion Criteria can be made if patient status is deemed not clinically significant by the PI.\n10. Severe thrombocytopenia increasing the risk of biopsy.\n11.
