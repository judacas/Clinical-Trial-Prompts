Subjects with diseases without known effective options, and subject who have declined standard or care therapy prior to study introduction are also eligible\n* Any prior palliative radiation therapy must have been completed at least 14 days prior to the start of study drugs, and patients must have recovered from any acute adverse effects prior to the start of study treatment\n* Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected (HIV1/2 antibody-positive) patients may participate if they meet all the following eligibility requirements:\n\n  * They must be on an anti-retroviral regimen with evidence of at least two undetectable viral loads within the past 6 months on this same regimen; the most recent undetectable viral load must be within the past 12 weeks\n  * They must have a CD4 count >= 250 cells/uL over the past 6 months on this same anti-retroviral regimen and must not have had a CD4 count < 200 cells/ul over the past 2 years, unless it was deemed related to the cancer and/or chemotherapy-induced bone marrow suppression.

If viral load proves undetectable at this time, continue CD4 and viral load checks every 8 weeks (q8w). If 2 consecutive viral load tests are undetectable, revert to q12w testing for CD4 and viral load testing\n    * If an opportunistic infection occurs with a CD4 count of < 200 cells/ul, hold study treatment. Initiate treatment of the infection and continue to hold study treatment; once clinically stable, CD4 count is > 200 cells/ul and viral load has remained undetectable, reinitiate study treatment\n* Patients with a past or resolved hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (defined as the presence of hepatitis B core antibody and absence of HBsAg) are eligible.

If elevated, check creatinine clearance (CrCl) with cut off >= 51 mL/min as calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault method or based on a 24-hour urine test (confirmation of creatinine clearance is only required when serum creatinine is > 1.5 X institutional ULN)\n* Estimated CrCl (glomerular filtration rate [GFR]) = (140-age [years]) x (weight [kg]) x Fa (72 x serum creatinine mg/dL) (a where F = 0.85 for females and F = 1 for males)\n* The effects of AZD1775 and olaparib on the developing human fetus are either unclear or are known to be teratogenic, women of childbearing potential and their partners, who are sexually active, must agree to the use of TWO highly effective forms of contraception in combination. This should be started from the signing of the informed consent and continue throughout the period of taking study treatment and for at least 1 month after last dose of study drug(s), or they must totally/truly abstain from any form of sexual intercourse. Male patients must use a condom during treatment and for 3 months after the last dose of study drug when having sexual intercourse with a pregnant woman or with a woman of childbearing potential. Female partners of male patients should also use a highly effective form of contraception if they are of childbearing potential. Male patients should not donate sperm throughout the period of taking study drugs and for 3 months following the last dose of study drugs.\n\n  * Acceptable non-hormonal birth control methods include:\n\n    * Total/True abstinence: When the patient refrains from any form of sexual intercourse and this is in line with their usual and/or preferred lifestyle; this must continue for the total duration of the trial and for at least 1 month after the last dose of study drug for women of child bearing potential. For male patients, 3 months after last dose. (Periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods, or declaration of abstinence solely for the duration of a trial] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.)\n    * Vasectomized sexual partner PLUS male condom. With participant assurance that partner received post-vasectomy confirmation of azoospermia\n    * Tubal occlusion PLUS male condom\n    * Intrauterine device (IUD) PLUS male condom.

Women are considered post-menopausal and not of childbearing potential if they have had 12 or more months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea following cessation of exogenous hormonal treatment with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy). In the case of oophorectomy alone, she will be considered not of childbearing potential only when her reproductive status has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment\n* Male patients will be advised to arrange for the freezing of sperm samples prior to the start of the study should they wish to father children while on study drugs or during the 3 months after stopping study drugs\n* Male or female patient >= 18 years of age. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of AZD1775 in combination with olaparib in patients < 18 years of age, children are excluded from this study, but will be eligible for future pediatric trials\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) score of 0-1 (Karnofsky >= 70%)\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

Subjects with brain metastases must have completed treatment, either surgery or radiation, and be stable for at least 28 days off steroid prior to screening. A brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrating there is no current evidence or progressive brain metastases is required in subjects with previous brain metastasis. Patients with breast tissue expanders may have brain computed tomography (CT) for assessment\n* Patients with either previous or current myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or features suggestive of MDS/AML (e.g., persistent anemia or other blood dyscrasias) are excluded because olaparib and AZD1775 are agents with the potential to induce MDS/AML\n* AZD1775 should not be given to patients who have a history of Torsades de pointes (TdP) unless all risk factors that contributed to TdP have been corrected\n* Any of the following cardiac diseases currently or within the last 6 months:\n\n  * Unstable angina pectoris\n  * Acute myocardial infarction\n  * Congestive heart failure >= class 2 (as defined by New York Heart Association [NYHA])\n  * Conduction abnormality not controlled with pacemaker or medication\n  * Significant ventricular or supraventricular arrhythmias (patients with chronic rate-controlled atrial fibrillation in the absence of other cardiac abnormalities are eligible)\n* Participants with a mean resting corrected QT interval (QTc) >= 480 msec at study entry, as calculated by the Frederica formula (QTcF) by institutional standards obtained from an electrocardiogram (ECG) or congenital long QT syndrome.
