Subjects with prior CNS involvement may be enrolled into the study if effective treatment of their CNS disease was completed at least 3 months prior to Day 1 with no evidence of disease clinically and at least stable findings on relevant CNS imaging.\n\nNon-malignant CNS disease such as stroke, epilepsy, CNS vasculitis, or neurodegenerative disease or receipt of medications for these conditions in the 2-year period leading up to study enrollment\n\nCurrently receiving or likely to require immunosuppressive therapy (e.g., prednisone >5 mg daily) for any reason during the treatment period, with the exception of inhaled corticosteroids.\n\nClinically significant infections, including:\n\n* HIV positive by serology\n* HBV positive by serology or PCR\n* HCV positive by serology or PCR\n\nLive vaccine <6 weeks prior to start of conditioning\n\nReceipt of an allograft organ transplant\n\nOngoing requirement for systemic graft -versus-host disease therapy\n\nPlasma cell leukemia defined as a plasma cell count >2000/mm^3\n\nPrior malignancy (other than current indication including any antecedent hematologic disorder) within the 2 years prior to enrollment except for the following: basal or squamous cell carcinomas of the skin, carcinoma in situ of the cervix or breast treated with curative intent, or localized prostate cancer treated with curative intent, or malignancy that, in the opinion of the investigator and Sponsor's Medical Monitor, is considered cured with minimal risk of recurrence within 3 years.\n\nWashout periods from prior therapies:\n\n- Chemotherapy, or radiation therapy, except for palliative purposes, within 14 days prior to the first dose of FT576 (Day 1) or five half-lives, whichever is shorter; Investigational therapy within 30 days prior to the first dose of FT576 study treatment or five half-lives, whichever is shorter; Biologic therapy (e.g., anti-CD38 mAbs or anti-SLAMF7 monoclonal antibodies), including autologous cellular immunotherapy (e.g. CAR-T/ CAR-NK), antibody-drug conjugates or bi-specific immune-cell engaging antibody within 30 days prior to first dose of FT576 (Day 1) or half -lives whichever is shorter. prior allogenic HSCT or allogenic CAR-T/CAR-NK within 6 months of first dose of FT576 (Day1).\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
