    "inclusion_criteria": "* Unequivocal histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of metastatic or locally advanced NSCLC not amenable to treatment with surgical resection or combined chemoradiation\n* Disease progression during or after treatment with at least one prior systemic therapy but no more than three lines of prior systemic therapy in the advanced or metastatic setting\n* Measurable disease according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1\n* Documentation of the presence of a KRAS G12C mutation\n* Availability of a representative formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor specimen in a paraffin block (preferred) or 10-15 (15 preferred) unstained, freshly cut, serial slides with an associated pathology report\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1\n* Life expectancy of >= 12 weeks\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Known hypersensitivity to any of the components of divarasib, or sotorasib or adagrasib\n* Malabsorption syndrome or other condition that would interfere with enteral absorption\n* Known concomitant second oncogenic driver\n* Mixed small-cell lung cancer or large cell neuroendocrine histology\n* Known and untreated, or active central nervous system (CNS) metastases\n* Leptomeningeal disease or carcinomatous meningitis\n* Uncontrolled pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, or ascites requiring recurrent drainage procedures biweekly or more frequently\n* Any infection that, in the opinion of the investigator, could impact patient safety, or treatment with therapeutic oral or IV antibiotics within 14 days prior to Day 1 of Cycle 1\n* Prior treatment with any KRAS G12C inhibitor or pan-KRAS/RAS inhibitor\n* More than 30 Gy of radiotherapy to the lung within 6 months of randomization\n* Uncontrolled tumor-related pain\n* Unresolved toxicities from prior anticancer therapy\n* History of malignancy within 5 years prior to screening, with the exception of the cancer under investigation in this study and malignancies with a negligible risk of metastasis or death (e.g., 5-year OS rate >90%), such as adequately treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix, nonmelanoma skin carcinoma, localized prostate cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ, or Stage I uterine cancer",
