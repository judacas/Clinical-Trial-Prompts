(Periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception). If patient is female and of childbearing potential, she must have a negative serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin (β-HCG) test < 14 days prior to registration and consent to ongoing pregnancy testing during the course of the study.\n* Male patients, even if surgically sterilized (i.e., status post-vasectomy), must agree to one of the following\n\n  * Practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study treatment period and through 90 days after the last dose of study drug, OR\n  * Practice true abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of he subject. (Periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception).\n* Subjects must have the willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan, laboratory tests, study procedures, and research procedures.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* MGRS associated with diseases other than plasma cell dyscrasia (e.g. CLL, B-cell neoplasm, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia...)\n* Plasma cell leukemia, AL amyloidosis, or POEMS syndrome.\n* Treatment with prior drugs aimed at the plasma cell dyscrasia.\n* Treatment with prior or concurrent investigational agents aimed at the plasma cell dyscrasia.\n* Female patients who are lactating or have a positive serum pregnancy test during the screening period.\n* Major surgery ≤ 14 days before registration.\n* Focal radiation therapy within 14 days prior to registration with the exception of palliative- radiotherapy for symptomatic management but not on measurable extramedullary plasmacytoma.\n* Disease-related central nervous system involvement.\n* The subject has uncontrolled significant intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection.\n* Clinically significant cardiac disease, including:\n\n  * Myocardial infarction within 6 months before randomization, or unstable or uncontrolled disease/condition related to or affection cardiac function (e.g., unstable angina, congestive heart failure, New York Heart Association Class III-IV)\n  * Uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia\n* Any serious medical or psychiatric illness that could, in the investigator's opinion, potentially interfere with the completion of treatment according to this protocol.\n* Known allergy to any of the study medications, their analogues, or excipients in the various formulations of any agent.\n* Concurrent malignancy except for treated non-melanoma skin cancer, cervical carcinoma in situ and low-risk prostate CA being monitored without treatment.\n* Grade 2 or higher peripheral neuropathy on clinical examination during the screening period.\n* Chemotherapy ≤ 14 days of registration.\n* Exposure to an investigational drug (including investigational vaccine) or invasive investigational medical device for any indication within 4 weeks or 5 pharmacokinetic halflives, whichever is longer.\n* Patients with known chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) <50% of predicted normal; moderate or severe persistent asthma within the past 2 years. Note that FEV1 testing is required for participants suspected of having COPD and participants must be excluded if FEV1 is <50% of predicted normal\n* Moderate or severe persistent asthma within the past 2 years, or uncontrolled asthma of any classification. Note that participants who currently have controlled intermittent asthma or controlled mild persistent asthma are allowed to participate.\n* Patients who have a contraindication to the use of any form of anticoagulation or antiplatelet agents.\n* The use of strong CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 inducers or inhibitors will not be allowed while patients are treated on this study.\n* Patients with Hepatic Child-Pugh score B and C.

Subjects with resolved infection (ie, subjects who are HBsAg negative but positive for antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen [anti-HBc] and/or antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen [anti-HBs]) must be screened using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) measurement of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA levels. Those who are PCR positive will be excluded. EXCEPTION: Subjects with serologic findings suggestive of HBV vaccination (anti-HBs positivity as the only serologic marker) AND a known history of prior HBV vaccination, do not need to be tested for HBV DNA by PCR.\n  * Seropositive for hepatitis C (except in the setting of a sustained virologic response [SVR], defined as aviremia at least 12 weeks after completion of antiviral therapy).\n  * Vaccination with live attenuated vaccines within 4 weeks of first study agent administration.\n  * Plasmapheresis within 28 days before randomization.",
