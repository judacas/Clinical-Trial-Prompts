    "official_title": "A Phase 3 Study of the Efficacy, Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Ustekinumab as Open-label Intravenous Induction Treatment Followed by Randomized Double-blind Subcutaneous Ustekinumab Maintenance in Pediatric Participants With Moderately to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Medically stable on the basis of physical examination, medical history, and vital signs, performed at screening. Any abnormalities must be consistent with the underlying illness in the study population and this determination must be recorded in the participant's source documents and acknowledged by the investigator\n* Must have had UC diagnosed prior to screening\n* Have moderately to severely active UC, defined as a baseline Mayo score of 6 through 12, inclusive, with a screening Mayo endoscopy subscore greater than or equal to (>=) 2 as determined by a central review of the video of the endoscopy\n* A participant who has had extensive colitis for >= 8 years, or disease limited to the left side of the colon for >= 10 years, must: a) have had a full colonoscopy to assess for the presence of dysplasia within 1 year before the first administration of study intervention or b) have a full colonoscopy with surveillance for dysplasia as the baseline endoscopy during the screening period. Results from these surveillance biopsies must be negative for dysplasia (low-grade, high-grade, or indeterminant) prior to the first administration of study intervention\n* Females of childbearing potential must have a negative highly sensitive urine pregnancy test at screening and at Week I-0 prior to study intervention administration\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 2 Years\nMust have maximum age of 17 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Have UC limited to the rectum only or to less than (<) 20 centimeter (cm) of the colon\n* Presence or history of colonic or small bowel obstruction within 6 months prior to screening, confirmed by objective radiographic or endoscopic evidence of a stricture with resulting obstruction (dilation of the colon or small bowel proximal to the stricture on barium radiograph or an inability to traverse the stricture at endoscopy)\n* Have a history of latent or active granulomatous infection, histoplasmosis, or coccidioidomycosis, or have had a nontuberculous mycobacterial infection prior to screening\n* Presence or history of any malignancy including presence or history of lymphoproliferative disease including lymphoma, or signs and symptoms suggestive of possible lymphoproliferative disease, such as lymphadenopathy of unusual size or location (example, nodes in the posterior triangle of the neck, infraclavicular, epitrochlear, or periaortic areas) and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, or clinically significant hepatomegaly or splenomegaly\n* Has known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to ustekinumab or its excipients",
