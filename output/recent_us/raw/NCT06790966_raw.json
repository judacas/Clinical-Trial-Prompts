    "exclusion_criteria": "An individual who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation in this study:\n\n* Participant has uncontrolled inter-current illness, including but not limited to poorly controlled hypertension or diabetes, ongoing or active systemic infection (ie, has discontinued all antibiotics for at least one week prior to first dose of study drug), diagnosed or suspected viral infection (except for HIV), or psychiatric illness/social situation that would limit compliance with study requirements, including ability to self-care for anticipated toxicities (eg. rash or paronychia).\n* Participants with medical conditions requiring chronic continuous oxygen therapy are excluded.\n* Participants with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with grade ≥3 breathlessness on the modified medical research council (mMRC) dyspnea scale are excluded.\n* Have known moderate or severe persistent asthma within the past 2 years, or current uncontrolled asthma of any classification.\n* Participant has a history of clinically significant cardiovascular disease including, but not limited to:\n\n  * Diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug, or any of the following within 6 months prior to the first dose of study drug: myocardial infarction, unstable angina, stroke, transient ischemic attack, coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft, or any acute coronary syndrome. Clinically non-significant thrombosis, such as non-obstructive catheter-associated clots, are not exclusionary.\n  * Prolonged QTcF interval >480 msec or clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia or electrophysiologic disease (eg, placement of implantable cardioverter defibrillator or atrial fibrillation with uncontrolled rate). Note: Participants with cardiac pacemakers who are clinically stable are eligible.\n  * Uncontrolled (persistent) hypertension: systolic blood pressure >180 mm Hg; diastolic blood pressure >100 mm Hg\n  * Congestive heart failure defined as New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III-IV or Hospitalization for congestive heart failure (any NYHA class) within 6 months of study Day 1\n  * Pericarditis/clinically significant pericardial effusion\n  * Myocarditis\n* Participant has had prior chemotherapy, targeted cancer therapy, or treatment with an investigational anti-cancer agent within 2 weeks or 4 half-lives, whichever is longer, before the first administration of study drug; or participant has received prior immunotherapy within 6 weeks before the first administration of study drug.

Those who are PCR positive will be excluded. EXCEPTION: Subjects with serologic findings suggestive of HBV vaccination (anti-HBs positivity as the only serologic marker) AND a known history of prior HBV vaccination, do not need to be tested for HBV DNA by PCR.\n  * Positive hepatitis C antibody (anti-HCV). Note: Participants with a prior history of HCV, who have completed antiviral treatment and have a sustained virologic response, defined as aviremia at least 12 weeks after completion of antiviral therapy are eligible.
