    "inclusion_criteria": "* Patients must have histologically confirmed invasive breast cancer with stage IV disease, either biopsy proven or with unequivocal evidence of metastatic disease by physical examination or radiological study.\n* Cohorts 1 and 2: Documented germline (Cohort 1) or somatic mutation or homozygous deletion (Cohort 2) in one of the DNA repair genes listed below that is deleterious or suspected to be deleterious, and no germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. The mutation may be identified through any CLIA approved NGS panel.\n\n  * ATM, ATR, BARD1, BRIP1 (FANCJ), CHEK2 , FANCA, FANCC, FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, FANCM, MRE11A, NBN, PALB2, RAD50, RAD51C, RAD51D, plus other HR-related genes at the discretion of Dr. Tung with the key study collaborators (see details below in italics). (Cohorts 1 or 2)\n\n    --- OR\n  * Documented somatic mutation (deleterious or suspected deleterious) in BRCA1 or BRCA2 through any CLIA approved lab only if in addition to the lack of a germline BRCA1/2 mutation is demonstrated through a CLIA approved lab. Patients with germline mutations in BRCA1/2 are NOT eligible for this study.

Mutations must be reviewed and confirmed by Dr. Tung to meet eligibility prior to registration.\n* Cohort 2a: somatic mutation of BRCA 1 or BRCA 2\n\n  -- The mutation must be identified through a CLIA-approved NGS panel. Mutations must be reviewed and confirmed by Dr. Tung to meet eligibility prior to registration. Documentation of absence of germline mutation in BRCA 1/2 is required.\n* All deep (homozygous) deletions, frameshift mutations and truncating mutations in the genes listed above are eligible as well as missense variants in these genes that have previously been reported as pathogenic or likely pathogenic.

For a lesion to be considered as measurable, it must be one that can be accurately measured at baseline as ≥ 10 mm in the longest diameter (except lymph nodes which must have short axis ≥ 15 mm) with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and which is suitable for accurate repeated measurements\n* Patients may not have progressed on more than two chemotherapy regimens in the metastatic setting.\n* The following will NOT be counted as a prior line of cytotoxic chemotherapy:\n\n  * If a patient discontinued a cytotoxic regimen due to toxicity (e.g., hypersensitivity or neuropathy) but had not progressed on that regimen, or if a prior chemotherapy regimen was discontinued after response achieved, it will not be counted in the number of prior chemotherapy regimens allowed.\n  * Prior hormonal therapy and non-hormonal targeted therapy; including the combination of an aromatase inhibitor and everolimus.\n  * Targeted and biologic therapies.\n  * The patient can receive a stable dose of bisphosphonates or denosumab for bone metastases, before and during the study as long as this was started at least 5 days prior to study treatment.\n* The most recent cytotoxic, biologic or targeted therapy received must have been completed at least 21 days prior to study treatment; hormonal therapy must have been completed at least 7 days prior, unless otherwise noted.\n* Prior therapy is allowed as follows:\n\n  * Platinum chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting is allowed, if the last platinum dose was > 12 months before identification of metastatic disease. Platinum-based chemotherapy in the metastatic setting is not permitted.\n  * History of prior anthracycline (e.g. doxorubicin, epirubicin) and taxane-based (e.g. paclitaxel, docetaxel) chemotherapy in the neo-adjuvant / adjuvant or metastatic setting is preferred, but not required.\n  * Patients with hormone receptor-positive (estrogen and/or progesterone receptor-positive) disease must have received and progressed on at least one endocrine therapy (adjuvant or metastatic), or have disease that the treating physician believes to be inappropriate for endocrine therapy. Endocrine therapy must have been completed at least 7 days before study treatment.\n  * Prior radiation is allowed; radiation therapy must have been completed at least 21 days before study treatment.\n  * Prior treatment with FDA approved or investigational biologics (other than PARP inhibitors) and novel molecularly targeted therapies, including oral or IV formulations, shall not exclude patients from participation.\n  * For agents with ambiguous categorization, final determination of patient eligibility will be made by the Protocol Chair prior to enrollment.\n  * Prior PARP inhibitor use is not allowed for this study\n* Age ≥ 18 years.\n* ECOG performance status 0-1 (Karnofsky ≥60%, see Appendix A) Life expectancy ≥16 weeks\n* Participants must have normal organ and bone marrow function measured within 28 days prior to registration as defined below:\n\n  * absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mcL\n  * white blood cells > 3,000/mcL\n  * platelets ≥100,000/mcL\n  * hemoglobin ≥ 10.0 g/dL with no blood transfusions (packed red blood cells in the past 28 days is permitted)\n  * total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal\n  * AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤2.5 × institutional upper limit of normal\n  * Serum or plasma creatinine ≤ 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)\n\n    --- OR\n  * creatinine clearance ≥51 mL/min/1.73 m2 for participants\n  * Estimated creatinine clearance = (140-age [years]) x weight (kg) (x F)a serum creatinine (mg/dL) x 72 ---- a where F=0.85 for females and F=1 for males.\n* Willingness to undergo biopsy.\n* Patients with a history of treated CNS metastases are eligible, provided they meet all of the following criteria: Disease outside the CNS is present; no clinical evidence of progression since completion of CNS-directed therapy; minimum of 2 weeks between completion of radiotherapy and Cycle 1 Day 1 and recovery from significant (Grade ≥3) acute toxicity with no ongoing requirement for > 10mg of prednisone per day or an equivalent dose of other corticosteroid.
