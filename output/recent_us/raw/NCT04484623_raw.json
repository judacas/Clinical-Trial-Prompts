Renal function: Calculated creatinine clearance (CrCL) > 30 mL/min (Cockroft-Gault Equation)\n    3. Liver function i. AST and ALT ≤ 2.5×ULN; AST or ALT ≤ 5×ULN if liver metastases are present ii. Total bilirubin (TBIL) ≤ 1.5×ULN; ≤3 X ULN for patients with Gilbert's disease\n    4. Coagulation function i. International normalized ratio (INR) or prothrombin time (PT)≤ 1.5×ULN (unless the patient is on stable dose of oral anticoagulant) ii. Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT)≤ 1.5×ULN\n11. Women of childbearing potential must confirm a negative serum pregnancy test within 3 days prior to the initiation of study treatment and begin use of an effective birth control directly after testing negative for pregnancy; Fertile patients and their partners must agree to use acceptable contraception for the duration of study drug use and for 120 days after the last administration of study treatment.\n\n    Acceptable contraception Single method i. Intrauterine device (IUD) ii. Vasectomy of a female subject's male partner iii. Contraceptive rod implanted into the skin Combined method (requires the use of two of the following) i.
