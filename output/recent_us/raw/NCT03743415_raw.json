    "official_title": "A Phase II Study of Definitive Therapy for Newly Diagnosed Men With Oligometastatic Prostate Cancer After Prostatectomy",
    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Willing and able to provide written informed consent.\n2. Age ≥ 18 years\n3. Eastern cooperative oncology group (ECOG) performance status ≤2\n4. Documented histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate\n5. Willing to undergo the following therapy: (1st) Systemic chemo-hormonal therapy with up to 6-months (~24 weeks) of neoadjuvant androgen deprivation and up to 6 cycles of chemotherapy, (2nd) definitive local tumor control with adjuvant radiation therapy, and (3rd) consolidative stereotactic radiation to oligometastatic lesions. Additionally, must be willing to be treated with a full two years of androgen deprivation.\n6. Oligometastatic prostate cancer: Stage T1-4, N0-1 and/or M1a-b (up to 5 metastatic lesions- including bone lesions and non-regional lymph nodes seen on bone scan, contrast enhanced CT scan, or positron emission tomography PET scan)\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be MALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 80 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Prior local non-surgical therapy to treat prostate cancer (e.g. radiation therapy, brachytherapy)\n2. Prior therapy to a metastatic site.\n3. Prior or ongoing systemic therapy for prostate cancer including, but not limited to:\n\n   1. Hormonal therapy (e.g. leuprolide, goserelin, triptorelin, degarelix)\n   2. CYP-17 (cytochrome P450 17α-hydroxy/17,20-lyase) inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole)\n   3. Antiandrogens (e.g. bicalutamide, nilutamide)\n   4. Second generation antiandrogens (e.g. enzalutamide, abiraterone)\n   5. Immunotherapy (e.g. sipuleucel-T, ipilimumab)\n   6. Chemotherapy (e.g. docetaxel, cabazitaxel) *Note: may be enrolled if hormone therapy was recently initiated (<90 days duration)). In the event that hormone therapy was initiated prior to study enrollment, the clock for 2 years of androgen deprivation would begin at the time of therapy initiation, rather than at study enrollment.\n4. Evidence of serious and/or unstable pre-existing medical, psychiatric or other condition (including laboratory abnormalities) that could interfere with patient safety or provision of informed consent to participate in this study.\n5. Any psychological, familial, sociological, or geographical condition that could potentially interfere with compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule.\n6. Abnormal bone marrow function [absolute neutrophil count (ANC)<1500/mm3, platelet count <100,000/mm3, hemoglobin <9 g/dL]\n7. Abnormal liver function (bilirubin >ULN ( upper limit of normal); AST (aspartate aminotransferase), ALT (alanine transaminase) > 2.5 x upper limit of normal)\n8. Creatinine clearance of ≥ 30 mL/min. CrCl (Creatinine clearance) should be calculated suing the Cockcroft-Gault formula.\n9. Active cardiac disease defined as active angina, symptomatic congestive heart failure, or myocardial infarction within previous six months.\n10. Prior history of malignancy in the past 3 years with the exception of basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. Other malignancies that are considered to have a low potential to progress may be enrolled at discretion of PI.",
