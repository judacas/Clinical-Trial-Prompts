    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Men and women ≥ 18 years of age.\n2. ECOG performance status of 0 to 2.\n3. Diagnosis of CLL that meets published diagnostic criteria (Hallek 2008):\n\n   1. Monoclonal B-cells (either kappa or lambda light chain restricted) that are clonally co-expressing ≥ 1 B-cell marker (CD19, CD20, or CD23) and CD5.\n   2. Prolymphocytes may comprise ≤ 55% of blood lymphocytes.\n   3. Presence of ≥ 5 x 10^9 B lymphocytes/L (5000/μL) in the peripheral blood (at any point since initial diagnosis).\n4. Must have documented CD20-positive CLL.\n5. Active disease meeting ≥ 1 of the following IWCLL 2008 criteria for requiring treatment:\n\n   1. Evidence of progressive marrow failure as manifested by the development of, or worsening of, anemia (hemoglobin < 10 g/dL) and/or thrombocytopenia (platelets < 100,000/μL).\n   2. Massive (i.e., ≥ 6 cm below the left costal margin), progressive, or symptomatic splenomegaly.\n   3. Massive nodes (i.e., ≥ 10 cm in the longest diameter), progressive, or symptomatic lymphadenopathy.\n   4. Progressive lymphocytosis with an increase of > 50% over a 2-month period or a LDT of < 6 months. LDT may be obtained by linear regression extrapolation of ALC obtained at intervals of 2 weeks over an observation period of 2 to 3 months. In subjects with initial blood lymphocyte counts of < 30 x 10^9/L (30,000/μL), LDT should not be used as a single parameter to define indication for treatment. In addition, factors contributing to lymphocytosis or lymphadenopathy other than CLL (e.g., infections) should be excluded.\n   5. Autoimmune anemia and/or thrombocytopenia that is poorly responsive to standard therapy.\n   6. Constitutional symptoms documented in the subject's chart with supportive objective measures, as appropriate, defined as ≥ 1 of the following disease-related symptoms or signs:\n\n   i. Unintentional weight loss ≥ 10% within the previous 6 months before screening.\n\n   ii. Significant fatigue (ECOG performance score 2; inability to work or perform usual activities).\n\n   iii. Fevers higher than 100.5°F or 38.0°C for ≥ 2 weeks before screening without evidence of infection.\n\n   iv. Night sweats for > 1 month before screening without evidence of infection.\n6. Meet the following laboratory parameters:\n\n   1. ANC ≥ 750 cells/μL (0.75 x 10^9/L), or ≥ 500 cells/μL (0.50 x 10^9/L) in subjects with documented bone marrow involvement, and independent of growth factor support 7 days before assessment.\n   2. Platelet count ≥ 50,000 cells/μL (50 x 10^9/L), or ≥ 30,000 cells/μL (30 x 10^9/L) in subjects with documented bone marrow involvement, and without transfusion support 7 days before assessment. Subjects with transfusion-dependent thrombocytopenia are excluded. If an Investigator has chosen bendamustine/rituximab as the Arm B treatment, platelets must be ≥ 75,000 cells/μL (75 x 10^9/L).\n   3. Serum AST and ALT ≤ 2.0 x ULN.\n   4. Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN.\n   5. Estimated creatinine clearance of ≥ 30 mL/min, calculated using the formula of Cockcroft and Gault [(140-Age) • Mass (kg)/(72 • creatinine mg/dL); multiply by 0.85 if female].\n7. Must have received ≥ 1 prior systemic therapies for CLL. Note: Single-agent steroids or localized radiation are not considered a prior line of therapy.

Ability to understand the purpose and risks of the study and provide signed and dated informed consent and authorization to use protected health information (in accordance with national and local patient privacy regulations).\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
