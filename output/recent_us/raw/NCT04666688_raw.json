    "inclusion_criteria": "1.

Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) and men able to father a child must be ready and able to use two medically acceptable methods of birth control per ICH M3 (R2) that result in a low failure rate of <1% per year when used consistently and correctly beginning at screening, during study participation, and until 6 months and 12 days after last dose for women and 102 days after last dose for men. A list of contraception methods meeting these criteria is provided in the patient information\n4. Histologically documented locally advanced or metastatic, unresectable (i.e. surgery morbidity would outweigh potential benefits), progressive or recurrent Dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDLPS), meeting the criteria for an open study cohort:\n\n   * Cohort A: patient has not received prior systemic therapy for DDLPS in any setting (including adjuvant, neoadjuvant, maintenance, palliative)\n   * Cohort B: patient has received any prior systemic therapy for DDLPS in any setting (including adjuvant, neoadjuvant, maintenance, palliative)\n5. Written pathology report indicating the diagnosis of DDLPS with positive MDM2 immunohistochemistry or MDM2 amplification as demonstrated by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) or next-generation sequencing (NGS)\n6. Presence of at least 1 measurable target lesion according to RECIST version 1.1. In patients who only have 1 target lesion, the baseline imaging must be performed at least 2 weeks after any biopsy of the target lesion\n7. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1\n8. Life expectancy ≥3 months at the start of treatment in the opinion of the investigator Further inclusion criteria apply.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",

Having to receive, or intending to receive, restricted medications or any drug considered likely to interfere with the safe conduct of the study\n6. Receiving treatment for brain metastases or leptomeningeal disease (LMD) which may interfere with safety and/or endpoint assessment\n7. Unable to swallow the study treatment\n8.
