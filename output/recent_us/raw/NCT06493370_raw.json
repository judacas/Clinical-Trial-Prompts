    "official_title": "A Phase 4 Randomized, Active-Comparator Controlled Trial to Study the Efficacy and Safety of Sugammadex (MK-8616) for the Reversal of Neuromuscular Blockade Induced by Either Rocuronium Bromide or Vecuronium Bromide in Morbidly Obese Subjects",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Have BMI ≥40 kg/m² (morbidly obese).\n* Be categorized as American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Physical Status Class 3\n* Have a planned surgical procedure that requires neuromuscular block with either rocuronium or vecuronium.\n* Have a planned surgical procedure (e.g., gastrointestinal, urologic, or laparoscopic procedures) that in the opinion of the investigator does not preclude maintenance of moderate or deep depth of NMB throughout the case (maintained by re-dosing or continuous infusion).\n* Have a planned surgical procedure that would allow objective neuromuscular monitoring techniques to be applied with access to the arm for neuromuscular transmission monitoring.\n* If female, who is not of reproductive potential, be one of the following: 1) postmenopausal (defined as at least 12 months with no menses in women ≥45 years of age; 2) has had a hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, or bilateral tubal ligation/occlusion at least 6 weeks prior to screening; 3) has a congenital or acquired condition that prevents childbearing; or 4) is undergoing surgical sterilization as the planned surgical procedure associated with participation in this study (e.g., hysterectomy or tubal ligation).\n* If female, who is sexually active and of child-bearing potential, agrees to use a medically accepted method of contraception through seven days after receiving protocol-specified medication. Please note the following: 1) Medically accepted methods of contraception include condoms (male or female) with a spermicidal agent, diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide, medically prescribed intrauterine device (IUD), inert or copper-containing IUD, surgical sterilization (e.g., hysterectomy or tubal ligation); 2) Abstinence (relative to heterosexual activity) can be used as the sole method of contraception if it is consistently employed as the subject's preferred and usual lifestyle and if considered acceptable by local regulatory agencies and Human Subjects Protection Review Boards; 3 Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, sympto-thermal, post-ovulation methods, etc.) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception; 4) If a contraceptive method listed above is restricted by local regulations/guidelines, then it does not qualify as an acceptable method of contraception for subjects participating at sites in this country/region.\n* Be able to provide (or the subject's legally authorized representative in accordance with local requirements), written informed consent for the trial. The participant or legally authorized representative may also provide consent for Future Biomedical Research.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Have an actual body weight <100 kg.\n* Have a pacemaker or automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator that precludes the assessment of bradycardia or arrhythmias.\n* Have a medical condition or surgical procedure that precludes reversal of neuromuscular block at the end of surgery.\n* Have neuromuscular disorder(s) that may affect neuromuscular block and/or trial assessments.\n* Are dialysis-dependent or have severe renal insufficiency (defined as estimated creatinine clearance of <30 mL/min.).\n* Have or are suspected of having a personal history or family history (parents, grandparents, or siblings) of malignant hyperthermia.\n* Have or are suspected of having an allergy (e.g., hypersensitivity and/or anaphylactic reaction) to study treatments or its/their excipients, to opioids/opiates, muscle relaxants or their excipients, or other medication(s) used during general anesthesia.\n* Have received or are planning to receive toremifene within 24 hours before or within 24 hours after study medication administration.\n* Have any condition that would contraindicate the administration of study medication.\n* Are currently pregnant, attempting to become pregnant, or lactating.\n* Have any clinically significant condition or situation (e.g., anatomical malformation that complicates intubation) other than the condition being studied that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with the trial evaluations or optimal participation in the trial.\n* Are currently participating in or has participated in an interventional clinical trial with an investigational compound (including any other current or ongoing trial with a Sugammadex treatment arm) or device within 30 days of signing the informed consent form of this current trial.",
