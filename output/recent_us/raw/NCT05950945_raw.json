Note: Acceptable methods of effective contraception are defined in the informed consent/assent form. Where required by local laws and regulations, additional country-specific contraception requirements may be outlined in a country-specific protocol supplement at the end of the Appendix Section of protocol.\n* Subject has known sensitivity to any of the products or components to be administered during dosing.\n* Subject likely to not be available to complete all protocol-required study visits or procedures, and/or to comply with all required study procedures to the best of the subject and investigator's knowledge.\n* History or evidence of any psychiatric disorder, substance abuse or any other clinically significant disorder, condition or disease (with the exception of those outlined above) that, in the opinion of the investigator or Amgen physician, if consulted, would pose a risk to subject safety or interfere with the study evaluation, procedures or completion.\n* Subject who is unwilling to minimize exposure with his/her blood or other body fluids to individuals who are at higher risks for HSV-1 induced complications (immunosuppressed individuals, HIV-positive individuals, pregnant women, or children under the age of 1 year) during talimogene laherparepvec treatment and through 28 days after the last dose of talimogene laherparepvec.\n* Evidence of clinically significant immunosuppression such as the following:\n\n  * primary immunodeficiency state such as severe combined immunodeficiency disease\n  * concurrent opportunistic infection\n  * receiving systemic immunosuppressive therapy (> 2 weeks prior to enrollment), including oral steroid doses (with the exception of maintenance physiologic replacement). Subjects who require intermittent use of steroids for inhalation or local steroid injection will not be excluded from the study\n  * less than 6 months from autologous bone marrow transplant or stem cell infusion\n  * history of allogeneic bone marrow transplant\n* History or evidence of xeroderma pigmentosum.\n* Sexually active subjects and their partners unwilling to use a male or female latex condom to avoid potential viral transmission during sexual contact while on treatment and within 30 days after treatment with talimogene laherparepvec. For those with latex allergies, polyurethane condoms may be used.\n* Prior chemotherapy, treatment dose radiotherapy, or biological cancer therapy within 14 days prior to enrollment or has not recovered to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 (CTCAE) grade 1 or better from adverse event due to cancer therapy administered more than 14 days prior to enrollment.\n* CNS tumor or clinically active brain metastases (patient with a history of treated brain metastases are eligible if there is radiographic evidence of improvement upon the completion of CNS-directed therapy and no evidence of interim progression between the completion of CNS-directed therapy and the screening radiographic study).\n* Currently receiving treatment in another investigational device or drug study, or less than 14 days since ending treatment on another investigational device or drug study(ies) or has not recovered to CTCAE version 4.0 grade 1 or better from adverse event due to other investigational device or drug study administered more than 14 days prior to enrollment.
