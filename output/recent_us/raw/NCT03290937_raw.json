    "official_title": "A Phase 3, Multicenter, Randomized, Controlled, Open Label, Assessor-Blinded Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Inhaled Isoflurane Delivered Via the Sedaconda ACD-S Compared to Intravenous Propofol for Sedation of Mechanically Ventilated Intensive Care Unit Adult Patients (INSPiRE-ICU1)",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Adults ≥18 years of age;\n* Patients who are anticipated to require >12 hours of invasive mechanical ventilation and continuous sedation in the ICU; and\n* Receipt of continuous sedation due to clinical need for sedation to RASS <0.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Need for RASS -5;\n* Sedation for invasive mechanical ventilation immediately prior to Baseline for >72 hours;\n* Severe neurological condition before ICU admission that causes the patient to lack ability to participate in the study (ie, unable to be assessed for RASS and CPOT);\n* Ventilator tidal volume <200 or >1000 mL at Baseline;\n* Need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), extracorporeal CO2 removal (ECCO2R), high frequency oscillation ventilation (HFOV), or high frequency percussive ventilation (HFPV) at Screening;\n* Comfort care only (end of life care);\n* Contraindication to propofol or isoflurane;\n* Known or family history of MH;\n* Severe hemodynamic compromise, defined as the need for norepinephrine ≥0.3 mcg/kg/min (or equivalent vasopressor dose) to maintain blood pressure within acceptable range, assumed to be mean arterial pressure ≥65 mmHg unless prescribed clinically;\n* Allergy to isoflurane or propofol, or have propofol infusion syndrome.\n* History of ventricular tachycardia/Long QT Syndrome;\n* Requirement of IV benzodiazepine or barbiturate administration for seizures or dependencies, including alcohol withdrawal\n* Neuromuscular disease that impairs spontaneous ventilation (eg, C5 or higher spinal cord injury, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, etc);\n* Concurrent enrollment in another study that, in the Investigator's opinion, would impact the patient's safety or assessments of this study;\n* Participation in other study involving investigational drug(s) or devices(s) within 30 days prior to Randomization;\n* Anticipated requirement of treatment with continuous infusion of a neuromuscular blocking agent for >4 hours;\n* Female patients who are pregnant or breast-feeding;\n* Imperative need for continuous active humidification through mechanical ventilation circuit;\n* Attending physician's refusal to include the patient; or\n* Inability to obtain informed consent.",
