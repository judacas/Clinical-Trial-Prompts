    "exclusion_criteria": "Exclusion Criteria (Step 2)\n\n* Receiving other investigational agents concurrently\n* Prior systemic anti-cancer therapy or any investigational therapy within five half-lives prior to starting study treatment.\n* Prior radiotherapy within 6 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment.\n* Major surgery within 6 weeks prior to starting study drug or patients who have not fully recovered from major surgery.\n* The diagnosis of another malignancy within ≤ 2 years before study enrollment, except for those considered to be adequately treated with no evidence of disease or symptoms and/or will not require therapy during the study duration (i.e., basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, carcinoma in situ of the breast, bladder or of the cervix, or low-grade prostate cancer with Gleason Score ≤ 6).\n* Current evidence of uncontrolled, significant intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, the following conditions:\n\n  * Graft-versus-host disease:\n\n    ---Acute or chronic\n  * Cardiovascular disorders:\n\n    * Congestive heart failure New York Heart Association Class III or IV, unstable angina pectoris, serious cardiac arrhythmias.\n    * Stroke (including transient ischemic attack [TIA]), myocardial infarction (MI), or other ischemic events, or thromboembolic event (eg, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism) within 3 months before the first dose.\n    * QTc prolongation defined as a QTcF > 500 ms.\n    * Known congenital long QT.\n    * Left ventricular ejection fraction < 55%.\n    * Uncontrolled hypertension defined as ≥ 140/90 as assessed from the mean of three consecutive blood pressure measurements taken over 10 minutes.\n  * Any other condition that would, in the Investigator's judgment, contraindicate the subject's participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns or compliance with clinical study procedures (e.g., infection/inflammation, intestinal obstruction, unable to swallow medication, [subjects may not receive the drug through a feeding tube], social/ psychological issues, etc.)\n* Active infection including HIV, tuberculosis (clinical evaluation that includes clinical history, physical examination, radiographic findings, and TB testing in line with local practice) or hepatitis C.\n* Note: Subjects with a past or resolved HBV infection (defined as the presence of hepatitis B core antibody [anti-HBc] and absence of HBsAg) are eligible.\n* Autoimmune hepatitis or decompensated hepatic disease\n* Medical, psychiatric, cognitive, or other conditions that may compromise the subject's ability to understand the subject information, give informed consent, comply with the study protocol or complete the study.\n* Known prior severe hypersensitivity to investigational product (IP) or any component in its formulations (NCI CTCAE v5.0 Grade ≥ 3).\n* Subjects taking prohibited medications as described in Section 6.5.1.
