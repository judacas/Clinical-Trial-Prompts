    "inclusion_criteria": "* Multiple myeloma (MM) according to IMWG diagnostic criteria\n* Were triple-class exposed (received prior treatment with a PI, an IMiD, and anti CD38 mAb)\n* Documented evidence of progressive disease based on investigator's determination of response by IMWG criteria on or after their last regimen\n* Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group-performance status (ECOG-PS) of 0 or 1 at screening. Participants with ECOG-PS 2 or 3 are eligible for the study if the ECOG-PS score is related to stable physical limitations (e.g., wheelchair-bound due to prior spinal cord injury) and not related to multiple myeloma or associated therapy\n* Be willing and able to adhere to the lifestyle restrictions specified in the protocol\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",

Also unresolved/severe dysgeusia referred by the participant or a finding in the physical examination/oral cavity inspection. Some examples include leukoplakia, prior mouth cancers, extensive dental caries, severe periodontitis, active oral infections, candidiasis, parotic gland removal, or radiotherapy with resultant xerostomia",
