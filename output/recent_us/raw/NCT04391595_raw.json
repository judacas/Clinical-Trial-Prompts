    "official_title": "Phase I Study of Autologous Transgenic T-Cells Expressing High Affinity Mesothelin-Specific T-Cell Receptor (TCR) (FH-TCR Tᴍsʟɴ) in Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* LEUKAPHERESIS: Tissue confirmation of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and expression of mesothelin (MSLN): Participants must have metastatic disease. Confirmation of diagnosis must be or have been performed by internal pathology review of archival, initial or subsequent biopsy or other pathologic material at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (Fred Hutch)/University of Washington (UW). Baseline tissue will be stained by immunohistochemistry (IHC) to confirm MSLN expression\n* LEUKAPHERESIS: Measurable disease by RECIST 1.1 criteria: Participants must have measurable disease. Baseline imaging (for example diagnostic computed tomography [CT] chest/abdomen/pelvis) must be obtained within 28 days prior to start of first planned FHMSLN-TCR infusion. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be substituted for CT in patients unable to have CT contrast\n* LEUKAPHERESIS: Previous treatment with chemotherapy: Patients may have been previously treated with at least one prior line of systemic therapy for metastatic disease\n* LEUKAPHERESIS: Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) type HLA-A*02:01: Participants must be HLA-A*02:01 in order for the infused transgenic T cells to recognize antigen-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) complexes on their tumor. HLA typing should be determined though a molecular approach in a clinical laboratory licensed for HLA typing\n* LEUKAPHERESIS: Life expectancy must be > 3 months at trial entry\n* LEUKAPHERESIS: 18 years or older\n* LEUKAPHERESIS: Capable of understanding and providing a written informed consent\n* LEUKAPHERESIS: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1\n* LEUKAPHERESIS: Tumor tissue amenable to safe biopsy and subject willing to undergo serial tumor biopsies at baseline (prior to first T cell infusion), 2-3 weeks after the first T cell infusion (prior to second T cell infusion), and approximately 2 weeks +/- 1 week after the 3rd infusion, if safe and feasible (these windows may vary due to manufacturing or clinical reasons): Should there be no tumor tissue that is accessible for biopsy, patients will still be considered for participation, at discretion of the investigator. Similarly, should an investigator determine that a biopsy cannot be performed safely for clinical reasons, biopsies may be cancelled or rescheduled. For subjects who do not have sufficient T cells for three T cell infusion, a tumor tissue biopsy will be performed at baseline (prior to the 1st T cell infusion), 2-3 weeks after the 1st infusion, and approximately 2 weeks +/- 1 week after the 2nd infusion (if applicable), if safe and feasible.\n* LEUKAPHERESIS: Participants must be at least 3 weeks from last systemic treatment for metastatic disease: At least 3 weeks must have passed since any: immunotherapy (for example, T cell infusions, immunomodulatory agents, interleukins, vaccines), small molecule or chemotherapy cancer treatment, other investigational agents. There is no washout period for radiation, as long as the irradiated lesion is not the lesion being evaluated for RECIST measurements on the protocol.

LVEF may be established with echocardiogram or multigated acquisition scan (MUGA) scan, and left ejection fraction must be >= 35%. Cardiac evaluation for other patients is at the discretion of the treating physician\n* LEUKAPHERESIS: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) > 1500 cells/ mm^3\n* LEUKAPHERESIS: Albumin ≥ 2.7 g/dL\n* LEUKAPHERESIS: Negative serum pregnancy test within 14 days before enrollment for women of childbearing potential, defined as those who have not been surgically sterilized or who have not been free of menses for at least 1 year\n* LEUKAPHERESIS: Fertile male and female patients must be willing to use an effective contraceptive method before, during, and for at least 4 months after the FH-TCR-TMSLN infusion\n* TREATMENT: Measurable disease by RECIST 1.1 criteria: Participants must have measurable disease. Baseline imaging (for example diagnostic CT chest/abdomen/pelvis) must be obtained within 28 days prior to start of first planned FH-TCR-TMsLN infusion.
