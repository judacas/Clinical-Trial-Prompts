    "inclusion_criteria": "* Documented informed consent of the participant and/or legally authorized representative.\n* Age: >= 18 years.\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) =< 2.\n* Life expectancy > 3 months.\n* Patients with histologically confirmed acute myeloid leukemia (AML), according to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria, with relapsed/refractory disease.\n* Patients must have any one of the following treatment history criteria:\n\n  * Relapsed AML\n\n    * Failed at least 1 line of salvage therapy or\n    * Untreated relapse and are not candidates for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHCT)\n  * De novo AML\n\n    * have not achieved complete response (CR) after 2 lines of therapy or\n    * refractory to frontline therapy and not eligible for alloHCT\n  * AML evolving from myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or myeloproliferative disorder who have failed hypomethylating agents (HMA) or induction chemotherapy\n  * Patients who have relapsed after allo-HCT are eligible if they are at least 3 months after HCT, do not have active graft versus host disease (GVHD) and are off immunosuppression except for maintenance dose of steroids (prednisone 10 mg/day or less).\n* Male subjects must agree to not donate sperm while taking protocol therapy through at least 90 days after the last dose.\n* White blood cell (WBC) =< 25 x 10^9/L prior to initiation of venetoclax. Cytoreduction with hydroxyurea prior to treatment and/or during cycle 1 may be required.\n* Total bilirubin =< 1.5 X upper limit of normal (ULN) (unless has Gilbert's disease).\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) =< 2.5 x ULN.\n* Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) =< 2.5 x ULN.\n* Creatinine clearance of >= 50 mL/min per 24 hour urine test or the Cockcroft-Gault formula.\n* QTc =< 480 ms.\n* Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP): negative urine or serum pregnancy test. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required.\n* Agreement by females and males of childbearing potential* to use an effective method of birth control or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course of the study through at least 6 months (females) and 3 months (males) after the last dose of protocol therapy.\n\n  * Childbearing potential defined as not being surgically sterilized (men and women) or have not been free from menses for > 1 year (women only).\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Current or planned use of other investigational agents, antineoplastic, biological, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy during the study treatment period, or within 2 weeks prior to day 1 of protocol therapy, with the following exception:\n\n  * Hydroxyurea which may be continued through cycle 1.\n* Expected to undergo HCT within 120 days of enrollment.\n* Current or planned use of agents that prolong or suspected to prolong QTc.\n* Received strong or moderate CYP3A inducers or St. John's Wort within 7 days prior to day 1 of protocol therapy.\n* Received strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors, or consumed grapefruit, grapefruit products, Seville oranges (including marmalade containing Seville oranges) or Star fruit within 3 days prior to day 1 of protocol therapy.\n* P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors within 7 days prior to day 1 of protocol therapy.\n* Narrow therapeutic index P-gp substrates within 7 days prior to day 1 of protocol therapy.\n* Acute promyelocytic leukemia.\n* Active central nervous system (CNS) leukemia.\n* Active fungal infection or bacterial sepsis.\n* Class III/IV cardiovascular disability according to the New York Heart Association classification.\n* Participants with clinically significant arrhythmia or arrhythmias not stable on medical management within two weeks of enrollment. Subjects with controlled, asymptomatic atrial fibrillation can enroll.\n* History of acute cardiovascular ischemic event, i.e., myocardial infarction or unstable angina within 6 months of enrollment.\n* History of unexplained syncope, significant histories of CAD (requiring revascularization by percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI] or coronary artery bypass grafting [CABG]), cardiomyopathy (ejection fraction [EF] < 50%).\n* Prior surgery or gastrointestinal dysfunction that may affect drug absorption (e.g., gastric bypass surgery, gastrectomy).\n* Unable to swallow capsules, has a partial or small bowel obstruction, or has a gastrointestinal condition resulting in a malabsorptive syndrome (e.g. small bowel resection with malabsorption).\n* Active peptic ulcer disease.\n* Other active malignancy except for localized skin cancer, bladder, prostate, breast or cervical carcinoma in situ.\n* Females only: Pregnant or breastfeeding.\n* Any other condition that would, in the Investigator's judgment, contraindicate the patient's participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns with clinical study procedures.\n* Prospective participants who, in the opinion of the investigator, may not be able to comply with all study procedures (including compliance issues related to feasibility/logistics).",
