    "exclusion_criteria": "* Patients who have received prior treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (e.g. erlotinib), or anti-Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) agents (e.g. cetuximab, panitumumab)\n* Patients currently receiving any medication known to induce central serous chorioretinopathy which in the opinion of the principal investigator, would make the administration of study drug hazardous\n* Patients with active hepatic or biliary disease (with exception of patients with Gilbert's syndrome, asymptomatic gallstones, liver metastases or stable chronic liver disease per investigator assessment)\n* Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements\n* Any underlying medical condition which, in the opinion of the principal investigator, will make the administration of study drug hazardous or obscure the interpretation of adverse events\n* Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents\n* Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial; no additional workup is needed to exclude brain metastases if the patient is asymptomatic or has no history of brain metastases\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to Selumetinib (AZD6244) or other agents used in study\n* Previous Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK), RAS, or Rapidly Accelerated Fibrosarcoma (RAF) inhibitor use\n* Patients with the following cardiac conditions are excluded:\n\n  * Uncontrolled hypertension (blood pressure [BP] of >= 150/95 despite medical support/management)\n  * Acute coronary syndrome within 6 months prior to starting treatment\n  * Uncontrolled angina - Canadian Cardiovascular Society grade II-IV despite medical support/management\n  * Heart failure New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II or above\n  * Prior or current cardiomyopathy (within 6 months) including but not limited to the following:\n\n    * Known hypertrophic cardiomyopathy\n    * Known arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy\n    * Abnormal ejection fraction (echocardiogram [ECHO]) =< 53% (if a range is given then the upper value of the range will be used) or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\n    * Previous moderate or severe impairment of left ventricular systolic function (left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] < 45% on echocardiography or equivalent on multi-gated acquisition scan [MUGA]) even if full recovery has occurred; echocardiogram (Echo) and additional cardiac studies not indicated unless clinically symptomatic or patient has significant cardiac history\n    * Severe valvular heart disease\n    * Atrial fibrillation with a ventricular rate > 100 beats per minute (bpm) on electrocardiogram (ECG) at rest\n    * Fridericia's corrected QT interval (QTcF) >= 450 msec or other factors that increase the risk of QT prolongation or arrhythmic events (e.g., heart failure, hypokalemia, family history of long QT interval syndrome) are excluded; the use of medication(s) that can prolong QTc interval is prohibited while treated on this study\n* Patients with known ophthalmologic conditions, such as:\n\n  * Current or past history of central serous retinopathy\n  * Current or past history of retinal vein occlusion\n  * Known intraocular pressure (IOP) > 21 mmHg (or upper limit of normal [ULN] adjusted by age) or uncontrolled glaucoma (irrespective of IOP); patients with controlled glaucoma and increased IOP who do not have meaningful vision (light perception only or no light perception) may be eligible after discussion with the study chair\n  * Subjects with any other significant abnormality on ophthalmic examination (performed by an ophthalmologist) should be discussed with the study chair for potential eligibility\n  * Ophthalmological findings secondary to long-standing optic pathway glioma (such as visual loss, optic nerve pallor or strabismus) or long-standing orbito-temporal plexiform neurofibroma (PN) (such as visual loss, strabismus) will NOT be considered a significant abnormality for the purposes of the study\n* Patients with refractory nausea and vomiting, chronic gastrointestinal (GI) diseases (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease) or significant bowel resection\n* Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible; HIV-positive patients not on antiviral therapy with undetectable viral loads and cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) counts > 300, and after confirmation of eligibility after discussing with the study chair are eligible",
