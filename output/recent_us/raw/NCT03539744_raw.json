For the dose expansion phase only patients with CLL with transformation to DLBCL or tFL will be eligible\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2\n* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >= 500/uL\n* Platelet count >= 30,000/uL (unless due to bone marrow involvement)\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) =< 2.5 ULN\n* Total bilirubin =< 1.5 ULN (unless due to liver involvement, hemolysis, or Gilbert?s disease)\n* Creatinine clearance >= 40 mL/min (Cockcroft-Gault estimated)\n* Women of childbearing potential and men who are sexually active must be practicing a highly effective method of birth control during and after the study consistent with local regulations regarding the use of birth control methods for subjects participating in clinical trials. Men must agree to not donate sperm during and after the study. For females, these restrictions apply for 1 month after the last dose of study drug. For males, these restrictions apply for 3 months after the last dose of study drug\n* Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum (beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [beta-hCG]) or urine pregnancy test at screening.
