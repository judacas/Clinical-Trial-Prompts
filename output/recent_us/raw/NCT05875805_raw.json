    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Provision of signed and dated informed consent form\n2. Stated willingness to comply with all study procedures and availability for the duration of the study\n3. Age 18 years or older\n4. Presumed diagnosis of GBM deemed to be potentially resectable and deemed to be a good candidate for postoperative standard of care temozolomide and radiation therapy.\n\n   1. The surgical objective is for gross total resection (GTR)/near-total resection (NTR) defined as greater than or equal to 95% of contrast enhancing (CE) tumor removed plus less than or equal to 1 cm3 residual CE tumor. Patients with subtotal resection will still be eligible if at least 70% of the CE tumor is resected.\n   2. Eligibility will be confirmed after surgery when diagnosis of GBM IDH-wt confirmed prior to randomization.\n   3. Patients with prior biopsy or subtotal resection are eligible if no other anti-cancer treatment received for glioblastoma and additional resection indicated.\n5. Ability to receive filgrastim (e.g. Neupogen), leukapheresis and 3 bi-weekly injections of DOC1021 near deep cervical lymph nodes + weekly pIFN x 6 weeks.\n6. Females of reproductive potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test and agree to use effective contraception (as determined appropriate for the patient by the investigator) during study treatment.\n7. Adequate kidney, liver, bone marrow function, and immune function, as follows:\n\n   1. Hemoglobin ≥ 8.0 gm/dL (use of transfusion or other intervention to achieve is acceptable)\n   2. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,500 cells/mm3\n   3. Platelet count ≥ 75,000/mm3\n   4. Calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl) > 30 mL/min using Cockcroft and Gault formula:\n\n   i. For males = (140 - age[years]) x (body weight [kg]) / (72 x serum creatinine [mg/dL]) ii. For females = 0.85 x value from male formula e. Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) except in patients with Gilbert's disease for which total bilirubin must be ≤ 2 times ULN f. Aspartate transaminase AST (SGOT) and alanine aminotransferase ALT (SGPT) ≤ 3 times the ULN\n8. Karnofsky Performance Score ≥ 70\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Multifocal, deep midline, infratentorial, recurrent, leptomeningeal or extracranial disease.\n2. Patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding.\n3. Known active HIV or hepatitis infection. Patients with HIV that is well-controlled and have undetectable viral titers remain eligible. Patients with history of HCV adequately treated such that RNA viral load is negative also remain eligible.\n4. Any severe or uncontrolled medical condition or other condition that could affect participation in this study as determined by the investigator, including but not limited to uncontrolled or severe cardiac disease, systemic autoimmune disorders requiring immunosuppression in the past 2 years, autoimmune hyper/hypothyroidism, untreated vi-ral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis.\n5. Treatment with another investigational drug or other experimental intervention within the last 30 days.",
