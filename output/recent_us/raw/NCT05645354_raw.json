    "inclusion_criteria": "* Patients must have histologically confirmed MIBC (T2-T4a, N0-N1, M0 per American Joint Commission on Cancer [AJCC]) pure or mixed histology urothelial carcinoma. Clinical node-positive (N1) patients are eligible provided the lymph nodes (LNs) are confined to the true pelvis and are within the planned surgical LN dissection template.\n* The most recent TURBT that showed muscularis propria invasion should be within 10 weeks prior to beginning study therapy. Patients must have sufficient baseline tumor tissue from either initial or repeat TURBTs. The local site pathologist will be asked to estimate and record the rough approximate percentage of viable tumor in the TURBT sample (initial or repeat TURBT with highest tumor content) to document at least 20% viable tumor content prior to registration.\n* Patients must be ineligible for cisplatin-based chemotherapy due to any of the following below OR refused cisplatin-based chemotherapy:\n\n  * Creatinine clearance(CrCl) <60 mL/min with Easter Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS) 0-1\n  * Creatinine clearance(CrCl) ≥ 60 mL/min with ECOG PS 2 (if patient fit for RC)\n  * Hearing impaired ≥ Grade 2 by CTCAE criteria\n  * Neuropathy ≥ Grade 2 by CTCAE criteria\n  * Patient refused cisplatin-based chemotherapy?\n* Patients must be medically fit for TURBT and RC.\n* Age ≥ 18 years.\n* Ability to understand and willingness to sign Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved informed consent.\n* Willing to provide tumor tissue, blood, and urine samples for research.\n* Adequate organ function as measured by the following criteria, obtained ≤ 4 weeks prior to registration:\n\n  * Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) ≥ 1000/mm³ (stable off growth factor within 4 weeks of first study drug administration)\n  * Platelets ≥ 100,000/mm³\n  * Hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL\n  * Serum Creatinine Clearance ≥ 30 mL/min using the Cockcroft-Gault formula\n  * Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) and Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 3x Upper Limit of Normal (ULN)\n  * Total Bilirubin ≤ 1.5x ULN (in the absence of previously diagnosed Gilbert's disease)\n* Women must not be pregnant or breastfeeding since we do not know the effects of nivolumab and lirilumab on the fetus or breastfeeding child.\n* Sexually active women of child-bearing potential with a non-sterilized male partner and sexually active men must agree to use 2 methods of adequate contraception (hormonal plus barrier or 2 barrier forms) OR abstinence prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for 5 months for women and 7 months for men following last dose of study drugs.\n* Active or prior documented autoimmune disease within the past 2 years prior to Screening or other immunosuppressive agent within 14 days of study treatment.\n* Patients may not have locally advanced unresectable or metastatic urothelial carcinoma as assessed on baseline radiographic imaging obtained within 28 days prior to study registration.\n* Patients may not have concurrent upper urinary tract (i.e. ureter, renal pelvis) invasive urothelial carcinoma. Patients with history of non-invasive (Ta, Tis) upper tract urothelial carcinoma that has been definitively treated with at least one post-treatment disease assessment (i.e. cytology, biopsy, imaging) that demonstrates no evidence of residual disease are eligible.\n* Patients may not have another malignancy that could interfere with the evaluation of safety or efficacy of the study drugs. Patients with a prior malignancy will be allowed without study chair approval in the following circumstances:\n\n  * Not currently active and diagnosed at least 3 years prior to the date of registration.\n  * Non-invasive diseases such as low risk cervical cancer or any cancer in situ.\n  * Localized (early stage) cancer treated with curative intent (without evidence of recurrence and intent for further therapy), and in which no systemic chemotherapy was indicated.(e.g. low/intermediate risk prostate cancer, etc.).\n* Patients may not have received any prior immune checkpoint inhibitor (i.e. anti-KIR, anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or other).\n* Patients may not have undergone major surgery (e.g. intra-thoracic, intra-abdominal or intra-pelvic), open biopsy or significant traumatic injury or specific anti-cancer treatment ≤ 4 weeks prior to starting study drug, or patients who have had percutaneous biopsies or placement of vascular access device ≤ 1 week prior to starting study drug, or who have not recovered from side effects of such procedure or injury.\n* Patients must not have clinically significant cardiac disease.\n* Patients may not have chronic active liver disease or evidence of acute or chronic Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV).\n* Patients may not have known diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Testing is not required in absence of clinical suspicion.\n* Patients may not have known diagnosis of any condition (e.g. post-hematopoietic or solid visceral organ transplant, pneumonitis, inflammatory bowel disease, etc.) that requires chronic immunosuppressive therapy. Usage of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDS) for the treatment of osteoarthritis and uric acid synthesis inhibitors for the treatment of gout are permitted.\n* Patients with any serious and/or uncontrolled concurrent medical conditions (e.g. active or uncontrolled infection, uncontrolled diabetes) or psychiatric illness that could, in the investigator's opinion, cause unacceptable safety risks or potentially interfere with the completion of the treatment according to the protocol are not eligible.\n* Patients may not have any live viral vaccine used for prevention of infectious diseases within 4 weeks prior to study drug(s).\n* Patients unwilling or unable to comply with the protocol.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
