    "exclusion_criteria": "* Active and uncontrolled systemic or clinically significant infection that would contraindicate myelosuppressive therapy or CART infusion\n* Patients intolerant of acalabrutinib\n* Requires treatment with proton pump inhibitors (eg, omeprazole, esomeprazole, lansoprazole, dexlansoprazole, rabeprazole, or pantoprazole). Note: Subjects receiving proton pump inhibitors who switch to H2-receptor antagonists or antacids are eligible for enrollment to this study\n* Patients with detectable cerebrospinal fluid malignant cells, or brain metastases, or with a history of cerebrospinal fluid malignant cells or brain metastases\n* History of a seizure disorder, cerebrovascular ischemia/hemorrhage, dementia, cerebellar disease, or any autoimmune disease with central nervous system (CNS) involvement\n* Use of a strong CYP3A inhibitor OR inducer within 7 days of starting study drugs or requirement of use of strong CYP3A inhibitor OR inducer at the time of enrollment\n* Disease that is known to be refractory to BTK inhibition\n* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) < 1000/ul\n* Platelets < 50K/ul\n* Another active malignancy requiring systemic treatment, unless approved by principal investigator (PI)\n* Clinically significant cardiovascular disease such as uncontrolled or symptomatic arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, or myocardial infarction within 6 months of screening, or any class 3 or 4 cardiac disease as defined by the New York Heart Association Functional Classification.
