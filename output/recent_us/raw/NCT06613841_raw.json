Female and male patients of child-producing potential must had agreed to avoid becoming pregnant or impregnating a partner, respectively, used double-barrier contraceptive measures, oral contraception, or had to avoid of intercourse, during the study, and until at least 120 for 90 days after the last dose of derazantinib.\n\nMale or female patients of child-producing potential must had agreed to comply with one of the following until at least 120 days after the last dose of derazantinib:\n\n1. Abstinence from heterosexual activity\n2. Using (or having their partner use) an acceptable method of contraception during heterosexual activity.\n\nKey\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Receipt of treatment before the first dose of study drug (Cycle 1 Day 1) within an interval shorter than the following, as applicable:\n\n   * One chemotherapy or biological (e.g., antibody) cycle interval\n   * Five half-lives of any small-molecule investigational or licensed medicinal product\n   * Two weeks, for any investigational medicinal product with an unknown half-life\n   * Four weeks of curative radiotherapy\n   * Seven days of palliative radiotherapy\n   * 28 days of radiotherapy\n2. Major surgery, locoregional therapy, or radiation therapy within four weeks of the first dose of derazantinib\n3. Previous treatment with any FGFR inhibitor (e.g., Balversa® [erdafitinib], Pemazyre® [pemigatinib], infigratinib, rogaratinib, futibatinib, lenvatinib, ponatinib, dovitinib, nintedanib, AZD4547, LY2784455).\n4. Patients who were unable or unwilling to swallow the complete daily dose of derazantinib capsules\n5. Clinically unstable central nervous system (CNS) metastases (to be eligible, subjects must had stable disease ≥ 3 months, confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scan, and/or had CNS metastases well controlled by low-dose steroids, anti-epileptics, or other symptom-relieving medications)\n6. Evidence of clinically significant corneal or retinal disorder which was likely to increase the risk of eye toxicity, including but not limited to bullous/band keratopathy, keratoconjunctivitis (unless keratoconjunctivitis sicca), corneal abrasion, inflammation/ulceration, confirmed by ophthalmologic examination.\n7. Uncontrolled or active hepatobiliary disorders, untreated or ongoing complications after laparoscopic procedures or stent placement, including but not limited to active cholangitis, biloma or abscess (to be eligible, the subjects had to be treated and disorders/complications should had been resolved within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of derazantinib)\n8. History of significant cardiac disorders:\n\n   * Myocardial infarction (MI) or congestive heart failure defined as Class II to IV per the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification within 6 months of the first dose of derazantinib (MI that occurred > 6 months prior to the first dose of derazantinib was permitted)\n   * QTcF >450 msec (males or females)\n9. Serum electrolyte abnormalities defined as follows:\n\n   * Hyperphosphataemia: Serum phosphate > institutional ULN\n   * Hyperkalemia: > 6.0 mmol/L\n   * Hypokalemia: < 3.0 mmol/L\n   * Hypercalcemia: corrected serum calcium < 1.75 mmol/L (< 7.0 mg/dL)\n   * Hypocalcemia: corrected serum calcium > 3.1 mmol/L (> 12.5 mg/dL)\n   * Hypomagnesemia: < 0.4 mmol/L (< 0.9 mg/dL)\n10.

History of additional malignancy that was progressing or required active treatment. Exceptions included basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that had undergone potentially curative therapy, and in situ cervical cancer.\n12. Uncontrolled illness not related to cancer, including but not limited to:\n\n    * Psychiatric illness/substance abuse/social situation that would limit compliance with study requirements\n    * Known uncontrolled human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection\n    * Severe bacterial, fungal, viral and/or parasitic infections on therapeutic oral or IV medication at the time of first dose of study drug administration\n13.
