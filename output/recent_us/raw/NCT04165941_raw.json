    "exclusion_criteria": "* Prior chemotherapy, biologic, targeted, or radiotherapy within 3 weeks prior to entering study or not recovered from grade >= 2 adverse events (AEs) due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier (except alopecia or neuropathy)\n* Prior MEK inhibitor or prior TAS-102 therapy\n* Use of other investigational drugs\n* History or current evidence of retinal vein occlusion (RVO) or current risk factors for RVO (e.g., uncontrolled glaucoma or ocular hypertension, history of hyperviscosity, or hypercoagulability syndromes)\n* History of retinal degenerative disease\n* History of Gilbert's syndrome\n* Previous or concurrent malignancy with the following exceptions:\n\n  * Adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of skin with adequate wound healing prior to study entry\n  * In situ carcinoma of the cervix treated curatively and without evidence of recurrence\n  * Primary malignancy completely resected and in complete remission >= 1 year\n* History of acute coronary syndromes (including myocardial infarction, unstable angina, coronary artery bypass graft, coronary angioplasty, or stenting) < 6 months prior to screening\n* Impaired cardiovascular function or clinically significant cardiovascular disease including any of the following: symptomatic congestive heart failure, clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias and/or conduction abnormalities < 6 months prior to screening except for atrial fibrillation and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia\n* Uncontrolled arterial hypertension despite appropriate medical therapy (systolic blood pressure > 160 or diastolic blood pressure > 100)\n* Neuromuscular disorders associated with elevated creatine kinase (CK, e.g., inflammatory myopathies, muscular dystrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or spinal muscular atrophy)\n* Started or planning to start on strenuous exercise regimen after first dose of study treatment (i.e., muscular activities, such as strenuous exercise, that can result in significant increase in plasma CK levels should be avoided while on trametinib treatment)\n* Gastrointestinal (GI) disease or impairment of GI function (e.g., active ulcerative disease, uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome, or small bowel resection)\n* Prior major surgery =< 3 weeks before study drug or not recovered from side effects of such procedure\n* Ongoing grade >= 3 neuropathy\n* Known hypersensitivity to any components of study drugs\n* Prior intolerance to a fluoropyrimidine\n* Any other condition that would, in the investigator's judgement, contraindicate the patient's participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns with clinical study procedures (e.g., infection/inflammation, intestinal obstruction, unable to swallow medications, social/psychological issues, etc.)\n* Prospective participants who, in the opinion of the investigator, may not be able to comply with all study procedures (including compliance issues related to feasibility/logistics)",
