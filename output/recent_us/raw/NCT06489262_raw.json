    "inclusion_criteria": "- ≥18 but ≤ 70 years of age\n\n* Diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and meets one of the following disease criteria:\n\n  * Primary induction failure:\n\n  ** De Novo AML: no CR after 2, 3 or 4 induction attempts with high dose chemotherapy\n  * Secondary AML (from MDS or treatment related): no CR after 1, 2 or 3 cycles of high dose chemotherapy\n\n    * Relapsed:\n  * Not in CR after 1 or 2 cycles of standard re-induction therapy\n  * Relapse diagnosed at the time of the 6 months post-HCT standard of care follow-up or later (i.e. based on bone marrow biopsy performed Day +170 or later) and without evidence of graft versus host disease (GVHD)\n\n    * For patients > 60 years of age, the minimum of 1 cycle of standard chemotherapy is not required.\n* Available HLA-matched or better but not fully HLA-matched (2/4 or 3/4 antigens) related donor (aged 18 to 75 years) with donor/recipient match based on a minimum of intermediate resolution DNA based Class I typing of the A and B locus who is CMV seropositive.\n* Karnofsky Performance Status ≥ 60%\n* Adequate organ function within 14 days of study registration (28 days for pulmonary and cardiac) defined as:\n\n  * Creatinine: Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 50 mL/min/1.73m^2 per current institutional calculation formula\n  * Hepatic: AST and ALT ≤ 3 x upper limit of institutional normal\n  * Pulmonary Function: oxygen saturation ≥ 90% on room air; PFT's required only if symptomatic or prior known impairment - must have pulmonary function >50% corrected DLCO and FEV1\n  * Cardiac Function: LVEF ≥ 40% by echocardiography or MUGA\n  * No symptomatic active conduction system abnormalities\n* Able to be off prednisone or other immunosuppressive medications for at least 3 days prior to FATE-NK100 cell infusion (excluding preparative regimen premedications)\n* Sexually active females of child bearing potential and males with partners of child bearing potential must agree to use effective contraception during therapy and for 4 months after completion of therapy\n* Voluntary written consent prior to the performance of any research related procedures\n\nArm Specific Inclusion Criteria\n\nHigh-Risk aGVHD (ARM 1):\n\n- Pediatric or adult (ages 0-76 years) HCT recipients with high-risk acute GVHD, as determined either by the refined MN acute GVHD risk score [28]: http://z.umn.edu/MNAcuteGVHDRiskScore OR high risk on the basis of blood biomarkers (Ann Arbor Score 3) [31]. Patients in this arm must start treatment within the first 7 days after onset of high-risk aGVHD.\n\nor\n\nSteroid- Dependent aGVHD (ARM 2A):\n\n- Pediatric or adult (ages 0-76 years) HCT recipient with grade II-IV steroid-dependent acute GVHD, defined as any one of the following: Flare of acute GVHD of at least grade II/IV severity within 8 weeks of tapering down or (off of) immunosuppression for acute GVHD, with the flare occurring on ≤0.5 mg/kg prednisone. This can include late-onset aGVHD and overlap syndrome.\n\nor\n\nSteroid-Refractory aGVHD (ARM 2B):\n\n- Pediatric or adult (ages 0-76 years) HCT recipient with grade II-IV steroid refractory acute GVHD, defined as any one of the following:\n\n* No response of acute GVHD after at least 4 days of systemic corticosteroids of at least 2 mg/kg prednisone or equivalent\n* Progression of acute GVHD within 3 days of systemic corticosteroids of at least 2 mg/kg prednisone or equivalent\n* Failure to improve to at least grade II acute GVHD after 14 days of systemic corticosteroids, with initial doses of at least 2 mg/kg prednisone or equivalent\n* Flare of acute GVHD of at least grade II/IV severity while on steroids at a dose >0.5/mg/kg/day. This can include late-onset aGVHD and overlap syndrome.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 70 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Myocardial Infraction (MI) within the previous 6 months\n* Acute leukemias of ambiguous lineage\n* Pregnant or breastfeeding - The agents used in this study include those that fall under Pregnancy Category D - have known teratogenic potential. Women of child bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at screening\n* History of or known active CNS involvement with AML\n* Active autoimmune disease requiring systemic immunosuppressive therapy\n* History of severe asthma and currently on chronic systemic medications (mild asthma requiring inhaled steroids only is eligible)\n* New or progressive pulmonary infiltrates on screening chest X-ray or chest CT scan unless cleared for study by Pulmonary. Infiltrates attributed to infection must be stable/improving (with associated clinical improvement) after 1 week of appropriate therapy (4 weeks for presumed or documented fungal infections).\n* Uncontrolled bacterial, fungal or viral infections including HIV-1/2 or active hepatitis C/B - chronic asymptomatic viral hepatitis is allowed\n* Received any investigational agent within the 14 days before the start of study treatment (1st dose of fludarabine)",
