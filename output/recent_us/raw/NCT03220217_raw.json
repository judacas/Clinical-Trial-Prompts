    "official_title": "Acupuncture vs. Standard of Care for Induction Intravesical BCG-Related Adverse Events in High-Risk Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* English-speaking\n* Diagnosis of American Urological Association (AUA) high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), including high grade (HG) pT1 (invading only the lamina propria of the bladder), recurrent HG pTa (superficial tumors), HG pTa > 3 cm in size or multifocal, any carcinoma in situ, any variant histology, any lymphovascular invasion, and HG prostatic urethral involvement\n* Diagnosis with urothelial carcinoma (primary histologic subtype), localized to the bladder, in the absence of nodal or other visceral metastases\n* Patients who have been indicated for induction intravesical BCG in shared-decision-making with their primary urologist\n* Have not received acupuncture in the previous 3 months\n* Access to phone for study contacts\n* Willing and able to participate in trial activities\n* Platelets: 20,000/ uL or greater\n* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC): 500 cells/uL or greater\n* Able to understand and willing to sign written informed consent in English\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Subjects who have had intravesical or systemic chemotherapy or radiation therapy for bladder cancer or for other malignancies prior to entering the study\n* Subjects who are indicated to receive other intravesical agents or therapies concurrently with BCG will be excluded\n* Subjects who have muscle-invasive bladder cancer, radiographic evidence of lymph node metastases or metastatic disease involving other organs including brain metastases\n* Patients with predominant histology other than urothelial carcinoma of the bladder who would not otherwise be considered candidates for BCG\n* BCG is contraindicated in:\n\n  * Patients who are pregnant or lactating\n  * Patients with active tuberculosis\n  * Immunosuppressed patients with congenital or acquired immune deficiency, whether due to concurrent disease (e.g. acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS], lymphoma, leukemia), concomitant cancer therapy (cytotoxic drugs, radiation), or immunosuppressive therapy (e.g. corticosteroids, disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs [DMARDs])\n  * Symptomatic urinary tract infection\n  * Febrile illness\n  * Patients requiring chronic treatment with certain antibiotics that may interfere with the effectiveness of BCG\n  * Any previous allergies or severe reactions to BCG\n* Not pregnant or trying to become pregnant. Acupuncture points included in the protocol are contraindicated with pregnancy\n* Does not have a pacemaker. There is potential of electrostimulation interfering with the operation and function of pacemakers\n* Patients requiring chronic treatment with certain antibiotics that may interfere with the effectiveness of BCG. Fluoroquinolone therapy may decrease the efficacy of intravesical BCG. Antibiotic therapy for ongoing treatment of active tuberculosis will decrease the efficacy of intravesical BCG\n* Uncontrolled or concurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements\n* Pregnant women are excluded. Acupuncture points included in the protocol are contraindicated with pregnancy and BCG is contraindicated in pregnancy\n* Pacemaker. Patients with pacemakers are restricted due to the potential of electrostimulation interfering with a pacemakers operation\n* Platelets: < 20,000/ uL. Risk of bleeding with acupuncture\n* ANC: < 500 cells/uL. Risk of infection with acupuncture\n* Received acupuncture in the previous 3 months. Acupuncture treatment effects persist after a course of treatment, previous exposure to the intervention has the potential to affect the baseline data for treatment and control arms",
