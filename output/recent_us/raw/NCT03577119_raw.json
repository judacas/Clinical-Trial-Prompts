    "inclusion_criteria": "Inclusion criteria\n\n* Males and females aged ≥ 18 to < 80 years at screening who have a diagnosis of moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis (with or without psoriatic arthritis) for at least 6 months before the first administration of trial drug (a self-reported diagnosis confirmed by the Investigator is acceptable), and which has been stable per Investigator opinion for the last 2 months with no changes in morphology or significant flares at both screening and baseline:\n\n  * involved body surface area (BSA) ≥ 10% and\n  * PASI score ≥ 12 and\n  * sPGA score of ≥ 3.\n* Participants of reproductive potential (childbearing potential1) must be willing and able to use highly effective methods of birth control per International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) M3 (R2) that result in a low failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly during the trial and for 6 months following completion or discontinuation from the trial medication. A list of contraception methods meeting these criteria is provided in patient information.\n* Signed and dated written informed consent in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and local legislation prior to admission to the trial.\n* Patients who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy according to Investigator judgement.\n\nExclusion criteria\n\n* Active ongoing inflammatory diseases other than psoriasis that might confound trial evaluations according to Investigator's judgment.\n* Prior exposure to any biologic therapies for any auto-immune diseases (eg: RA, Psoriasis, Crohns Disease, etc).\n* Patients with a significant disease other than psoriasis and/or a significant uncontrolled disease (such as, but not limited to, nervous system, renal, hepatic, endocrine, hematological, autoimmune or gastrointestinal disorders). A significant disease is defined as a disease which, in the opinion of the Investigator, may (i) put the patient at risk because of participation in the trial, or (ii) influence the results of the trial, or (iii) cause concern regarding the patient's ability to participate in the trial.\n* Major surgery (major according to the Investigator's assessment) performed within 12 weeks before enrollment or planned within 6 months after screening, e.g., total hip replacement.\n* Any documented active or suspected malignancy or history of malignancy within 5 years prior to screening, except appropriately treated (in the opinion of the Investigator) basal cell carcinoma of the skin or in situ carcinoma of uterine cervix.\n* Patients who must or wish to continue the intake of restricted medications or any drug considered likely to interfere with the safe conduct of the trial.\n* Currently enrolled in another investigational device or drug trial, or less than 30 days (or less than 5 half-lives, whichever is longer) since ending another investigational device or drug trial(s), or receiving other investigational treatment(s).\n* Chronic alcohol or drug abuse or any condition that, in the Investigator's opinion, makes the patient an unreliable trial subject or unlikely to complete the trial.\n* Women who are pregnant, nursing, or who plan to become pregnant during the course of this trial or within the period at least 6 months following completion or discontinuation from the trial medication.\n* Forms of psoriasis (e.g., pustular, erythrodermic and guttate) other than chronic plaque psoriasis. Drug-induced psoriasis (i.e., new onset or current exacerbation from e.g., beta blockers or lithium).\n* Primary or secondary immunodeficiency (history of, or currently active), including known history of HIV infection or a positive HIV test at screening (per the Investigator discretion and where mandated by local authorities).\n* Known chronic or relevant acute TB; IGRA TB test or PPD skin test will be performed according to the labelling for Humira®. If the result is positive, patients may participate in the trial if further work up (according to local practice/guidelines) establishes conclusively that the patient has no evidence of active TB. If latent TB is confirmed, then treatment must have been initiated before treatment in the study and continued according to local country guidelines.\n* Known clinically significant (per Investigator opinion) coronary artery disease, significant cardiac arrhythmias, moderate to severe congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association Classes III or IV) or interstitial lung disease observed on chest X-ray.\n* Patients with a history of any clinically significant adverse reaction (including serious allergic reactions, or anaphylactic reaction, or hypersensitivity) to murine or chimeric proteins, previously used biological drug or its excipients, or natural rubber and latex.\n* Positive serology for HBV or HCV.\n* Receipt of a live/attenuated vaccine within 12 weeks prior to the Screening Visit; patients who are expecting to receive any live/attenuated virus or bacterial vaccinations during the trial or up to 3 months after the last dose of trial drug.\n* Any treatment (including biologic therapies) that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may place the patient at unacceptable risk during the trial.\n* Known active infection of any kind (excluding fungal infections of nail beds), any major episode of infection requiring hospitalisation or treatment with intravenous (i.v.) antiinfectives within 4 weeks of the Screening Visit or completion of oral anti-infectives within 2 weeks of the Screening Visit.\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) > 2.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) at screening.\n* Hemoglobin < 8.0 g/dL at screening.\n* Platelets < 100,000/μL at screening.\n* Leukocyte count < 4000/μL at screening.\n* Calculated creatinine clearance < 60 mL/min at screening.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 80 Years",
