    "inclusion_criteria": "* Subjects aged ≥ 18 years.\n* Histologically confirmed Stage IIIB-D or Stage IV recurrent metastatic melanoma that is resectable or borderline resectable as determined by a Surgical Oncologist.\n* Recurrent disease at eligibility must have been confirmed with biopsy while receiving or within 3 months of completion of adjuvant anti-PD1 therapy.\n* ECOG Performance Status ≤ 1.\n* Adequate organ function as defined as:\n\n  * Hematologic:\n\n    * Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1500/mm3\n    * Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3\n    * Hemoglobin ≥ 10 g/dL\n  * Hepatic:\n\n    * Total Bilirubin ≤ 1.5x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)\n    * AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤ 3 × institutional ULN ----Subjects with liver metastases will be allowed to enroll with AST and ALT levels ≤ 5 x ULN.\n  * Renal:\n\n    * Estimated creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min by Cockcroft-Gault formula:\n* For subjects of childbearing potential: Negative pregnancy test or evidence of post-menopausal status or evidence of permanent surgical sterilization. The post-menopausal status will be defined as having been amenorrheic for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. The following age-specific requirements apply:\n\n  * Subjects < 50 years of age:\n\n    * Amenorrheic for ≥ 12 months following cessation of exogenous hormonal treatments; and\n    * Luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone levels in the post-menopausal range for the institution\n  * Subjects ≥ 50 years of age:\n\n    * Amenorrheic for ≥ 12 months following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments; or\n    * Had radiation-induced menopause with last menses >1 year ago; or\n    * Had chemotherapy-induced menopause with last menses >1 year ago\n* Subjects of childbearing potential and subjects with a sexual partner of childbearing potential must agree to use a highly effective method of contraception as described in Section 5.3.1.\n* Subject has adequate archival tissue or agrees to undergo a fresh tissue biopsy if sufficient archival tissue is unavailable.\n* Recovery to baseline or ≤ Grade 1 CTCAE v5 from toxicities related to any prior treatments, unless AE(s) are clinically nonsignificant and/or stable on supportive therapy per the treating investigator.\n* Able to provide informed consent and willing to sign an approved consent form that conforms to federal and institutional guidelines.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Receiving other investigational agents currently or within 28 days of study treatment.\n* Prior systemic anti-cancer therapy ≤ 14 days or within five half-lives prior to starting study treatment, whichever is shorter.\n* Prior radiotherapy 45 days prior to the first dose of study treatment.\n* Major surgery 4 weeks prior to starting study drug or who have not fully recovered from major surgery.\n* Active infection requiring the use of systemic antibiotics.\n* Systemic steroid therapy greater than physiologic equivalent (10mg prednisone/day) or any other form of systemic immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to registration.\n* Active secondary malignancy, unless the malignancy is not expected to interfere with the evaluation of safety\n* Known brain metastases or cranial epidural disease.\n* Current evidence of uncontrolled, significant intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, the following conditions:\n\n  --Cardiovascular disorders:\n  * Congestive heart failure New York Heart Association Class III or IV, unstable angina pectoris, serious cardiac arrhythmias.\n  * Stroke (including transient ischemic attack [TIA]), myocardial infarction (MI), or other ischemic events, or thromboembolic event (eg, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism) within 3 months before the first dose.\n  * QTc prolongation defined as a QTcF > 500 ms.\n  * Known congenital long QT.\n  * Left ventricular ejection fraction < 55%.\n  * Uncontrolled hypertension defined as ≥ 140/90 as assessed from the mean of three consecutive blood pressure measurements taken over 10 minutes.\n* Any other condition that would, in the Investigator's judgment, contraindicate the subject's participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns or compliance with clinical study procedures (e.g., infection/inflammation, intestinal obstruction, unable to swallow medication, [subjects may not receive the drug through a feeding tube], social/psychological issues, etc.)\n* HIV infection with a detectable viral load within 6 months of the anticipated start of treatment.\n\n  --Note: Subjects on effective antiretroviral therapy with an undetectable viral load within 6 months of the anticipated start of treatment are eligible for this trial.\n* Active infection including tuberculosis (clinical evaluation that includes clinical history, physical examination, radiographic findings, and TB testing in line with local practice), hepatitis B (positive HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) result), or hepatitis C.\n\n  --Note: Subjects with a past or resolved HBV infection (defined as the presence of hepatitis B core antibody [anti-HBc] and absence of HBsAg) are eligible. Subjects positive for hepatitis C (HCV) antibody are eligible only if polymerase chain reaction is negative for HCV RNA.\n* Medical, psychiatric, cognitive, or other conditions that may compromise the subject's ability to understand the subject information, give informed consent, comply with the study protocol or complete the study.\n* Known prior severe hypersensitivity to investigational product (IP) or any component in its formulations (NCI CTCAE v5.0 Grade ≥ 3).\n* Subjects taking prohibited medications as described in Section 6.7.2. A washout period of prohibited medications for a period of at least five half-lives or as clinically indicated should occur before the start of treatment.",
