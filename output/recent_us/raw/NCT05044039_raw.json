    "official_title": "A Phase II Study of the Anti-GITR Agonist INCAGN1876 and the PD-1 Inhibitor INCMGA00012 in Combination With Stereotactic Radiosurgery in Recurrent Glioblastoma",
    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Prior histopathologically proven diagnosis of World Health Organization (WHO) grade IV glioblastoma, OR histopathologically proven diagnosis of gliosarcoma, OR molecular diagnosis of glioblastoma per c-IMPACT-NOW criteria (\"diffuse astrocytic glioma, IDH-wildtype, with molecular features of glioblastoma, WHO grade IV\"; this requires presence of either amplification of EGFR, whole chromosome 7 gain AND whole chromosome 10 loss, or TERT promoter mutation). Participants are eligible if the prior diagnosis was low-grade glioma and a subsequent histological diagnosis of glioblastoma was made (e.g. secondary GBM).\n2. Participants must have glial tumor that is recurrent following prior first-line radiation therapy (prior dose must have been 40-75 Gy and may have been either photon or proton radiation), and must have unequivocal evidence of tumor progression by MRI scan\n3. Cohort A and Sub-Arm 1 of Cohort B only: Patient must have at least one measurable (>=1cm x 1cm) contrast-enhancing tumor focus for which stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is clinically indicated, as determined by the Investigator, and must be able to achieve radiation target coverage without exceeding dose constraints. The contrast-enhancing target must not be larger than 4 cm in maximal diameter. Multifocal disease is allowed as long as this criterion is met\n\n   • Sub-Arms 2 of Cohort B can have any size tumor, and the tumor does not need to be amenable to SRS\n4. Cohort B (surgical) patients only: patients must be undergoing surgery that is clinically indicated as determined by their care providers\n5. Tumor O-6-methylguanine-deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methyltransferase (MGMT) methylation status must be available from any prior GBM tumor specimen; results of routinely used methods for MGMT methylation testing (e.g. mutagenically separated polymerase chain reaction [MSPCR] or quantitative polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) are acceptable)\n6. Patients may have had treatment for an unlimited number of prior relapses but must not have had prior bevacizumab or other vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF/VEGFR) inhibitors (exception: prior bevacizumab is allowed if it was administered for the treatment of radiation necrosis rather than progressive tumor and was stopped at least 4 weeks prior to MRI showing demonstrating tumor progression). Prior gliadel wafers are only allowed if placed during the first surgery for GBM at initial diagnosis.\n7. Patients must have recovered from severe toxicity of prior therapy; the following intervals from previous treatments are required to be eligible:\n\n   * 12 weeks from completion of radiation\n   * 6 weeks from a nitrosourea cytotoxic chemotherapy\n   * 3 weeks from a non-nitrosourea cytotoxic chemotherapy\n   * 4 weeks from any investigational (not Food and Drug Administration [FDA]-approved for glioblastoma) agents, or within a time interval less than at least 5 half-lives of the investigational agent whichever is shorter\n   * 3 weeks from any major surgery, including brain surgery for recurrent tumor resection\n8. If patient is on systemic corticosteroids to treat brain edema and/or brain edema-related symptoms, the dose must be 2mg of dexamethasone (or equivalent) daily or less for a minimum of 5 days prior to first dose of study drug.\n9. Patients must be able to swallow oral medications\n10. Age 18 or older\n11. Karnofsky performance status >= 60\n12. Life expectancy >3 months\n13. Absolute lymphocyte count >= 500/uL\n14. Adequate hepatic function within 7 days prior to start of study treatment, defined as follows\n\n    * Total bilirubin (except patients with Gilbert's Syndrome, who are eligible for the study but exempt from the total bilirubin eligibility criterion) ≤ 2.0 mg/dl\n    * ALT and AST ≤ 2.5x upper limit of normal (ULN)\n15. Adequate renal function within 7 days prior to start of study treatment, defined as follows:\n\n    • Serum creatinine <=1.5 x institutional ULN OR calculated creatinine clearance (glomerular filtration rate can also be used in place of creatinine or CrCl) >=50 mL/min for subjects with creatinine levels >1.5x institutional ULN\n16. Reproductive Status\n\n    1. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 7 days prior to the start of study drug.\n    2. Women must agree to not breastfeed during the study or for 180 days after the last dose of study treatment\n    3. WOCBP must agree to use an adequate method to avoid pregnancy (as defined below) from the time of study screening through 180 days from last dose of study drug\n    4. Males who are sexually active with WOCBP must agree to follow instructions for method(s) of contraception (as defined below) starting with the first dose of study drug through 180 days after the last dose of study\n    5. Azoospermic males and WOCBP who are continuously not heterosexually active are exempt from contraceptive requirements. However, these WOCBP must still undergo pregnancy testing as described in this section.\n\n    At a minimum, participants of childbearing potential who are sexually active and their partners must agree to the use of a highly effective form of contraception (as defined below) throughout their participation beginning with the time of consent, during the study treatment, and for 180 days after last dose of study treatment(s).\n\n    HIGHLY EFFECTIVE METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION:\n    * Hormonal methods of contraception including combined oral contraceptive pills, vaginal ring, injectables, implants and intrauterine devices (IUDs) by WOCBP subject or male subject's WOCBP partner. Female partners of male subjects participating in the study may use hormone-based contraceptives as one of the acceptable methods of contraception since they will not be receiving study drug\n    * Nonhormonal IUDs\n    * Bilateral Tubal ligation\n    * Vasectomy\n    * Sexual Abstinence\n\n      * It is not necessary to use any other method of contraception when complete abstinence is elected.\n      * WOCBP participants who choose complete abstinence must continue to have pregnancy tests.\n      * Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective contraception must be discussed in the event that the WOCBP participants chooses to forego complete abstinence.\n17. Participant must, in the opinion of the Investigator, be able to comply with study procedures\n18. Patients must be able to understand the study procedures and agree to participate in the study by providing written informed consent (or have legally authorized representative sign on patient's behalf if patient physically unable to sign consent due to neurologic deficit)\n\nExclusion Criteria\n\nAny of the following would exclude the subject from participation in the study:\n\n1. Contrast-enhancing tumor in brainstem or spinal cord (subjects do not need spinal MRI for screening, but known spinal cord tumor is exclusionary)\n2. Diffuse leptomeningeal disease\n3. Prior bevacizumab or other vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF/VEGFR) inhibitors (exception: prior bevacizumab is allowed if it was administered for the treatment of radiation necrosis rather than progressive tumor and was stopped at least 4 weeks prior to MRI showing demonstrating tumor progression).\n4. Patients with clinically significant mass effect or midline shift (e.g., 1-2 cm of midline shift)\n5. Use of any immunosuppressive medication other than steroids, including but not limited to antimetabolites, calcineurin inhibitors, and/or anti-TNF agents within six months of start of study drug\n6.
