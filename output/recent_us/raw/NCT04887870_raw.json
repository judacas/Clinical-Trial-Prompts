    "inclusion_criteria": "* Participant must have measurable disease as defined per RECIST version 1.1\n* Has a histologically confirmed colorectal adenocarcinoma with metastatic or unresectable disease (Stage IV as defined by American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] 8th edition)\n* No prior systemic therapy for colorectal cancer (CRC) in the metastatic setting except for the induction treatment of first-line therapy. Note: Local regional treatment performed during induction systemic treatment is allowed\n* Participants who have completed the first-line induction treatment, with an overall response of stable disease or better. The duration of induction treatment should be completed within approximately 6 months. The first dose of study treatment needs to occur within 2 weeks (for 2-week regimen) or 3 weeks (for 3-week regimen) to 6 weeks after Day 1 of the last cycle of induction therapy\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Participants whose disease has become resectable at the investigator's discretion during or after induction treatment are not eligible\n* Progressive disease occurred less than 6 months from completion of any prior neoadjuvant therapy (ie, chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy) or adjuvant therapy (ie, chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy), whichever occurred later\n* Participants who have been treated with anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibody in the induction treatment\n* Any prior therapy targeting T-cell stimulation or checkpoint pathways\n* Participants with B-raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase (BRAF)V600E mutations\n* Have locally or centrally confirmed microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method or dMMR by immunohistochemistry (IHC) method\n\nNote: Other protocol defined criteria may apply.",
