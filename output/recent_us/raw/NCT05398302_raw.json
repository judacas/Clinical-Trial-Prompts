    "official_title": "A Phase 2b, Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, Multi-center Study of the Effects of Psilocybin-assisted Psychotherapy on Psychiatric and Existential Distress in Advanced Cancer",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Aged ≥ 21\n* Diagnosis of Advanced Cancer defined as:\n\n  * Solid tumors to include stage 3 or 4, metastatic illness, or recurrent illness\n  * Hematologic malignancies to include, but not limited to, Stage 3 or 4 non-Hodgkins lymphoma, late-stage multiple myeloma or second-line therapy for multiple myeloma, and all forms of acute myeloid leukemia\n* Functional Status defined as: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) ≤2 and Palliative Performance Scale (PPS) ≥60%\n* Clinically significant Anxiety defined as SIGH-A >17 at Screening\n* Have an identified support person: agree to be accompanied home (or to an otherwise safe destination) by the support person, or another responsible party, following dosing\n* Participants of childbearing potential must agree to practice an effective means of birth control throughout the duration of the study.
