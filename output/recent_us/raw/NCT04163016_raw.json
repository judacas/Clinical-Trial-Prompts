For patients at high risk of breast cancer who have not been diagnosed with breast cancer, no surgery is required.\n* Completion of chemotherapy, if indicated. Concurrent use of radiation therapy, LHRHa therapy, anti-HER2 therapy, PARP inhibitor, and CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy is permitted. Prior tamoxifen is permitted.\n* Agree to avoid taking omega-3 fatty acid supplements from sources outside the trial during study participation.\n* ECOG Performance Status ≤ 3.\n* Able to complete questionnaires in English.\n* Able to provide informed consent and willing to sign an approved consent form that conforms to federal and institutional guidelines.\n\nExclusion Criteria\n\n* Prior use of AI therapy for treatment or prevention of breast cancer.\n* Use of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation during the 3 months prior to enrollment.
