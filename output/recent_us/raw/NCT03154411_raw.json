    "official_title": "A Phase I Trial of CD19-targeted Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T Cells That Constitutively Secrete Interleukin 18 (19-28z/IL-18) in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory (R/R) Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Patients must have R/R ALL meeting one of the following criteria:\n* For Philadelphia chromosome negative (Ph-negative) B-ALL: Refractory or relapsed disease to at least 1 prior multiagent systemic chemotherapy regimen that included both induction and consolidation therapy\n* For Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+positive) B-ALL: patients must have exhibited persistent or progressive disease following at least 1 prior second- or third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor\n* Signed informed consent form (ICF) prior to any study procedures\n* Age: The first 3 patients enrolled into the study will be ≥ 17 years of age at time of enrollment. If a DLT is observed, the additional 3 patients in this cohort will also be ≥ 17 years of age. Additional patients will be ≥12 years of age at time of enrollment.\n* Documentation of CD19 positivity on leukemia blasts if prior anti-CD19 treatment\n* History of prior allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is allowed if ≥3 months from time of enrollment and no evidence of acute or chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD) within 4 weeks prior to enrollment\n* Donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) permitted if ≥4 weeks prior to leukapheresis\n* History of secondary CNS or meningeal involvement allowed if:\n\n  * cannot be the only site of disease\n  * absence of neurologic symptoms, such as: seizures, stroke-like deficits, altered mental status, aphasia, or psychosis\n* Adequate organ function at time of screening, including:\n\n  * ALT or AST ≤5x ULN and total bilirubin ≤2 (or ≤3 if history of Gilbert's syndrome or leukemic infiltration of the liver)\n  * Serum creatinine <2.0mg/100mL\n  * SaO2 ≥92% on room air\n  * Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥50% within 1 month of screening\n* ECOG performance status 0-1 or Lansky performance status ≥ 60 for patients < 16 years old\n* Prior CD19-targeted therapies (including CD19 CAR-T cell and CD19 bispecific T-cell engagers) are allowed including anti-CD19 CAR T therapy, as long as CD19 positivity is confirmed on most recent bone marrow or tumor biopsy\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 17 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Concurrent active malignancy excluding: nonmelanoma skin cancer or localized solid tumor that has undergone definitive therapy and with low risk of recurrence, e.g., prostate, breast\n* Burkitt's leukemia or lymphoma or CML in lymphoid blast crisis\n* Radiologically detected or symptomatic CNS disease or CNS 3 disease (i.e., presence of ≥5/µL WBCs in CSF). Subjects with adequately treated CNS leukemia are eligible.\n* The following medications are excluded:\n\n  * Steroids: Therapeutic doses of corticosteroids (greater than 10mg daily of prednisone or its equivalent) within 7 days of leukapheresis or 72 hours prior to CAR T cell infusion.\n  * Chemotherapy: Should be stopped one week prior to leukapheresis or starting lymphodepleting chemotherapy. Hydroxyurea for cytoreduction can be administered up to 72 hours before leukapheresis or CAR T cell infusion.\n* History of class III-IV New York Heart Association (NYHA) heart failure, cardiac angioplasty or stenting, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, or other clinically significant cardiac condition within 6 months of screening\n* Patients with history of significant autoimmune disease and/or inflammatory condition affecting the CNS are ineligible\n* Systemic treatment for GVHD within 4 weeks prior to enrollment\n* Patients with known severe autoimmune disease (e.g., Crohn's, rheumatoid arthritis, or lupus) that in the investigator's opinion has high likelihood of requiring systemic immune suppressive medications\n* Patients with HIV infection\n* Patients with active hepatitis B infection (as manifested by either detectable hepatitis B virus DNA by PCR and/or positivity for hepatitis B surface antigen)\n* Patients with active hepatitis C infection (as manifested by detectable hepatitis C virus RNA by PCR)\n* Patients with uncontrolled systemic fungal, bacterial, viral or other infection including COVID-19 at time of leukapheresis or at time of CAR T cell infusion. For those patients who have had a recent COVID-19 infection, at least 4 weeks should be passed before the COVID-19 infection date and CAR T cell infusion.\n* Other uncontrolled medical or psychological conditions as well as social or logistical issues that may interfere with compliance with the protocol, as determined by the investigator\n* Treatment with live, attenuated vaccine <4 weeks prior to leukapheresis\n* Pregnant or lactating/breastfeeding women",
