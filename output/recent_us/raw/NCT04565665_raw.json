Patients who have had multiple rounds of platinum-based chemotherapy with events of intermittent progressive disease (PD) are eligible as long as progression has been confirmed while on or within 12 months from platinum based therapy OR\n  * Arm B: Platinum ineligible status (i.e., patients unable to receive platinum-containing chemotherapy, in the opinion of the treating investigator, regardless of PD-L1 status) or chemotherapy ineligible status (i.e., patients unable to receive treatment with any chemotherapy, in the opinion of the treating investigator, regardless of PD-L1 status)\n\n    * Note: The eligible patient population for Arm B was revised in protocol amendment 10 from 'cisplatin ineligible patients with PD-L1 positive disease' to 'platinum ineligible patients (i.e., unable to receive platinum-containing chemotherapy, in the opinion of the treating investigator, regardless of PD-L1 status) or chemotherapy ineligible patients (i.e., unable to receive treatment with any chemotherapy, in the opinion of the treating investigator, regardless of PD-L1 status).' This revision was made to align with the updated United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) indications for pembrolizumab (MK-3475) that were released in August of 2021 for patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma\n* All patients must have measurable disease in accordance with RECIST criteria version (v) 1.1\n\n  * Note: radiological evaluation should occur within 28 days prior to study registration\n* Patients must be naive to prior PD-L1 or EZH2 inhibitors\n\n  * Note: patients in Arm A should have received platinum-based chemotherapy only\n* Age >= 18 years\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =< 2\n* Leukocytes >= 3000/mcL (performed within 14 days prior to registration)\n* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >= 1500/mcL (performed within 14 days prior to registration)\n* Platelets >= 100 000/mcL (performed within 14 days prior to registration)\n* Hemoglobin >= 9 g/dL or >= 4.9 mmol/L (performed within 14 days prior to registration)\n* Creatinine =< 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) OR measured or calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl) >= 30 mL/min for patient with creatinine levels > 1.5 x institutional ULN (performed within 14 days prior to registration)\n\n  * Creatinine clearance (CrCl) should be calculated per institutional standard\n  * Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) can also be used in place of creatinine or CrCl\n* Total bilirubin =< 1.5 x ULN OR direct bilirubin =< ULN for patients with total bilirubin levels > 1.5 x ULN (performed within 14 days prior to registration)\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT]) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT]) =< 2.5 x ULN OR =< 5 x ULN for patients with liver metastases (performed within 14 days prior to registration)\n* International normalized ratio (INR) or prothrombin time (PT) =< 1.5 x ULN unless patient is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or partial thromboplastin time (PTT) is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants (performed within 14 days prior to registration)\n* Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) =< 1.5 x ULN unless patient is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants (performed within 14 days prior to registration)\n* The effects of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) and tazemetostat on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because PD-1 inhibitors as well as EZH2 inhibitors are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation\n\n  * Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication.
