    "official_title": "Phase Ib Clinical Trial of Autologous Anti-NY-ESO-1 TCR-Engineered T Cells in Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Locally Advanced or Metastatic NY-ESO-1-Expressing Triple Negative Breast Cancer",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Female aged >= 18 years\n* Histologically confirmed advanced or metastatic TNBC that have relapsed on or are refractory to 2 or more lines of standard-of-care therapy including immune checkpoint inhibitors, chemotherapy, trastuzumab deruxtecan (TDX-d) and poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors if indicated, but less than 4 lines of total therapies. TNBC is defined as estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor negative (< 10% immunohistochemistry [IHC] staining) and HER2 negative (IHC 1+ or 0 AND/OR in situ hybridization negative based on:\n\n  * Single-probe average HER2 copy number < 4.0 signals/cell\n  * Dual-probe HER2/CEP17 ratio < 2.0 with an average HER2 copy number < 4.0 signals/cell)\n* HLA-A2+ and tumoral overexpression of NY-ESO-1 (2 to 3+ IHC staining in > 50% of cells)\n* Have measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1\n* Life expectancy >= 6 months\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1\n* Hemoglobin >= 9.0 g/dL (transfusions permitted)\n* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >= 1500/mm^3\n* Platelet count >= 100,000/mm^3\n* Creatinine (Cr) < 2 x upper limit of normal (ULN), and Cr clearance (CrCl) >= 50 mL/min by Cockcroft and Gault\n* Alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) < 2 x ULN (Patients with liver metastases whose ALT/AST are < 5 x ULN are eligible for enrollment)\n* Bilirubin < 2 x ULN\n* White blood cell (WBC) count > 2500/uL and < 15000/uL\n* Lymphocyte count >= 500/uL\n* Cardiac ejection fraction >= 50%\n* Negative serum pregnancy (human chorionic gonadotropin [beta-hCG]) test within 7 days of day 0 (leukapheresis) for women of childbearing potential (WOCBP). WOCBP must be willing to use a highly effective method of contraception for the course of the study through 90 days after A2-ESO-1 TCR-engineered T cell infusion\n* Willing and able to provide written informed consent for the study\n* Willing to provide biopsy tissues and blood samples as required by the study\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be FEMALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or non-cytotoxic investigational agent within 2 weeks of day 0 (leukapheresis)\n* Received cyclophosphamide within the past 4 months\n* Evidence of New York Heart Association class III or greater cardiac disease\n* History of myocardial infarction, stroke, ventricular arrhythmia, or symptomatic conduction abnormality within the past 12 months\n* History of congenital QT prolongation\n* Absolute QT interval of > 470 msec in the presence of > 4.0 mEq/L potassium and > 1.8 mg/dL magnesium\n* Brain or leptomeningeal metastases\n* Females who are pregnant or breastfeeding\n* Hypersensitivity or intolerance to cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, or their components\n* Alcoholic liver disease or other hepatic disease with the exception of liver metastases\n* History of gastrointestinal bleeding, ulceration, or perforation\n* Any severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions or other conditions that could affect participation in the study, such as severely impaired lung function, any active (acute or chronic) or uncontrolled infection/disorders, and non-malignant medical illnesses that are uncontrolled or whose control may be jeopardized by the study treatment\n* Current use of medications that interact with or compromise the immune system such as steroid doses > 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent daily within 2 weeks before leukapheresis\n* History of immunodeficiency disease or autoimmune disease\n* Concurrent use of any complementary or alternative medicines\n* Unwilling or unable to comply with the study protocol\n* Prior major surgery that requires general anesthesia must be completed at least 4 weeks before leukapheresis and surgery that requires local anesthesia (except for study tissue sample collection) must be completed at least 2 weeks before leukapheresis",
