    "official_title": "A Phase I, Open Label Study Employing the Topical Immunomodulator Diphencyprone to Improve Efficacy of PD-1 or PD-L1 Immune Checkpoint Inhibition in the Treatment of Advanced Cancer With Cutaneous Metastases",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Clinically diagnosed cancer with at least three cutaneous metastasis sites that are able to be biopsied.\n* Subject's oncologist plans as next standard of care treatment to use an FDA- approved PD-1 or PD-L1 ICI therapy. In other words, the subject would be treated with PD-1 or PD-L1 ICI therapy even if not taking part in this study. Subjects can be either ICI-naïve (never having received ICI previously), or may have progressed/relapsed during ICI therapy, but the treating oncologist has elected to continue PD-1 or PD-L1 ICI therapy.\n* Age ≥ 18 years.\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2.\n* Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for 90 days following completion of therapy. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately:\n* A female of child-bearing potential is any woman (regardless of sexual orientation, having undergone a tubal ligation, or remaining celibate by choice) who meets the following criteria:\n\n  * Has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or\n  * Has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months).\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
