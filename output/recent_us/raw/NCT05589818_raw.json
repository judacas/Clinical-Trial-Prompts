    "official_title": "Multicenter, Prospective Trial of ElectromagnetIc Bronchoscopic and Electromagnetic Transthoracic Navigational Approaches for the Biopsy of Peripheral Pulmonary Nodules",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* The patient is â‰¥21 years old,\n* The patient has a lung nodule identified on chest CT and is a candidate for elective EMN bronchoscopic evaluation as determined by the treating pulmonologist,\n* The size of the target nodule, as measured at its greatest diameter, is between 1-3cm,\n* Staging at the time of enrollment indicates NO/N1 (does not involve lymph nodes or includes involvement in nodes within ipsilateral hilum),\n* The patient has an intermediate risk of malignancy (5-65% per the Mayo Model) and is in need of diagnosis for alternative treatment, OR The patient has a high probability of cancer (>65%) and will be referred for surgical evaluation or stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). Note: If the patient refuses surgery or if the surgeon requests a definitive diagnosis prior to surgery the patient will have the option to be included in this study,\n* The patient has a lack of bleeding disorders, and\n* The patient is willing and able to provide informed consent.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 21 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* The patient is pregnant as confirmed by urine or serum pregnancy testing,\n* The patients has a body mass index (BMI) >40,\n* There is a predetermined plan to pursue stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in the event of a nondiagnostic study procedure in patients with a nodule within SPiNPerc range (i.e. The patient would not go on for a CT guided TTNA), OR There is a predetermined plan to pursue stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in the event of a nondiagnostic study procedure in patients where the target nodule is within a region considered to be not accessible to a percutaneous approach as determined by the radiology core lab and thus would prevent a confirmatory tissue diagnosis before SBRT.",
