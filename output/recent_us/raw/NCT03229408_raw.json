    "official_title": "A Phase II, Randomized Two-Arm Study of Everolimus and Letrozole, +/- Ribociclib (LEE011) in Patients With Advanced or Recurrent Endometrial Carcinoma",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Patient has signed the informed consent (ICF) prior to any screening procedures being performed and is able to comply with protocol requirements.\n* Patients must have histologically-confirmed endometrial carcinoma (endometrioid and mixed endometrioid tumors, any grade).\n* Patients must have advanced or recurrent disease that is refractory to curative treatment based on imaging or clinical exam.\n* Patient must consent to allow for a baseline tumor biopsy. Tumor material from biopsies done before the screening period are acceptable if the biopsy was performed within 3 months prior to the planned treatment start and no other systemic cancer therapy was administered in the interim. If a biopsy is performed and the specimen is considered non-diagnostic, does not have enough tissue, or the biopsy is deemed infeasible to perform, this does not prevent the patient from proceeding with the treatment\n* Patients must have had no more than two prior chemotherapeutic regimens for recurrent endometrial carcinoma. Chemotherapy administered in conjunction with primary radiation as a radio-sensitizer is not counted as a prior treatment for recurrent or advanced disease.\n* Prior radiation therapy of any kind is allowed.\n* Prior treatment with letrozole is allowed if the patient meets the washout period of 10 days.\n* All patients must have measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 defined as at least one \"target lesion\" that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (>= 10 mm longest dimension to be recorded; Lymph nodes must be >= 15 mm per short axis). Each lesion must be > 20 mm when measured by palpation or conventional imaging techniques (computed tomography [CT] or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] - based on primary physician preference) or > 10 mm with spiral CT scan. Measurable lesions must be at least 2 times the slice thickness in millimeters. Tumors within a previously irradiated field will be designated as \"non-target\" lesions unless progression is documented. Ascites and pleural effusions are not considered measurable disease. If the measurable disease is confined to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature should be confirmed by cytology/histology.\n* Patients must not be pregnant, breastfeeding or of child-bearing potential. Patients are considered not of child bearing potential if they are surgically sterile (they have undergone a total hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or they are postmenopausal for greater than 12 months (if patient is uncertain of amenorrhea for 12 months, a pregnancy test will be done to confirm pregnancy status). Patients in whom ovaries are present and were not previously menopausal at the time of hysterectomy, should have a serum estradiol < 10 pm/mL to confirm ovarian senescence.\n* Patients must be off all other anti-tumor therapies (including immunologic agents) for at least four weeks prior to study registration. Patients on hormonal agents require a washout for 10 days.\n* Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) performance status of 0 to 1.\n* Absolute neutrophil count >= 1.5 x 10^9/L (at screening).\n* Platelets >= 100 x 10^9/L (at screening).\n* Hemoglobin >= 9.0 g/dL (at screening).\n* International normalized ratio (INR) =< 1.5 (at screening).\n* Serum creatinine =< 1.5 mg/dL or creatinine clearance >=50 mL/min (at screening).\n* Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) >= 30mL/min/1.73m^2 (at screening) according to the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula.\n* In the absence of liver metastases, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) < 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN). If the patient has liver metastases, ALT and AST < 5 x ULN (at screening).\n* Total bilirubin < ULN; or total bilirubin =< 3.0 x ULN or direct bilirubin =< 1.5 x ULN in patients with well-documented Gilbert's syndrome (at screening).\n* Fasting serum cholesterol =< 240 mg/dL or =< 7.75 mmol/L and fasting triglycerides =< 2.5 x ULN (at screening).\n\n  * NOTE: In case one or both of these thresholds are exceeded, the patient can only be included after initiation of appropriate lipid lowering medication.\n* Patient with available standard 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) with the following parameters at screening: a. Corrected QT interval by Fridericia's formula (QTcF) interval at screening < 450 msec (using Fridericia's correction). b. Resting heart rate 50-100 beats per minute (bpm).\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be FEMALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Patients who have uterine sarcomas, carcinosarcomas, serous tumors (any component) or pure clear cell carcinomas.\n* Patients currently receiving anticancer therapies or who have received anticancer therapies within 4 weeks of the start of study drug (including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, antibody based therapy, etc.)\n* Patient has not recovered from all toxicities related to prior anticancer therapies to National Cancer Institute (NCI)-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03 grade =< 1 (exception to this criterion: patients with grade 1 taxane-induced neuropathy, any grade of alopecia, amenorrhea or other toxicities not considered a safety risk for the patient as per investigator's discretion are allowed to enter the study).\n* Patient has had major surgery within 14 days prior to starting study drug or has not recovered from major side effects (tumor biopsy is not considered as major surgery).\n* Participation in other studies involving investigational drug(s) within 30 days prior to randomization or within 5 half-lives of the investigational product (whichever is longer) or participation in any other type of medical research judged not to be scientifically or medically compatible with this study.\n* Patients receiving chronic, systemic treatment with corticosteroids or another immunosuppressive agent. Topical, short duration (< 5 days) of systemic corticosteroids, eye drops, local injections, or inhaled corticosteroids are allowed.\n* Patients should not receive immunization with attenuated live vaccines within one week of study entry or during study period.
