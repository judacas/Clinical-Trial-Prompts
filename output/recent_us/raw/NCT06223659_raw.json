Prior radiotherapy to the region of the study cancer within less than 6 months\n4. Patients who have received prior radiation therapy and who, in the opinion of the treating radiation oncologist, cannot be reirradiated safely without excess risk of severe toxicity given prior radiation dose to critical structures.\n5.

Severe, active co-morbidity, defined as follows:\n\n    1. Unstable angina and/or congestive heart failure requiring hospitalization within the last 6 months\n    2. Transmural myocardial infarction within the last 6 months\n    3. Acute bacterial or fungal infection requiring intravenous antibiotics at the time of registration\n    4.
