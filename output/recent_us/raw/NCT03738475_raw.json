The other questions do not impact whether a patient screens positive or negative. They do not have an impact on study eligibility.\n* English-speaking. Due to the developmental nature of this study, assessing feasibility with a small number of patients, we do not have all response tools and questionnaires translated into multiple languages. In a future larger study, it will be important to translate all documents into multiple languages in order to include non-English speakers.\n* Age â‰¥18 years.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be FEMALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
