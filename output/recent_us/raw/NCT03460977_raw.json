The LVEF must be >= 50% regardless of the cardiac imaging facility's lower limit of normal. (LVEF assessment performed by echocardiogram is preferred; however, MUGA scan may be substituted based on institutional/situational preferences)\n* Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen are eligible for this trial\n* Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients on effective anti-retroviral therapy with undetectable viral load within 6 months of registration are eligible for this trial\n* ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR COHORT 1, TREATMENT REGIMEN 2 PATIENTS WHO MIGRATE TO COHORT 2: Cohort migration: Patients treated with control treatment fulvestrant who experience disease progression may be eligible to migrate to Cohort 2 and receive combination treatment with binimetinib and fulvestrant. Patients who choose to do so must meet laboratory values and performance status requirements below and should begin treatment within 28 days\n* PATIENTS WHO MIGRATE TO COHORT 2: Patient's willingness to migrate to Cohort 2 affirmed\n* PATIENTS WHO MIGRATE TO COHORT 2: The patient must have an ECOG performance status of 0-2\n* PATIENTS WHO MIGRATE TO COHORT 2: Absolute neutrophil count >= 1,500/mm^3\n* PATIENTS WHO MIGRATE TO COHORT 2: Platelet count >= 100,000/ mm^3\n* PATIENTS WHO MIGRATE TO COHORT 2: Hemoglobin level >= 10 g/dL\n* PATIENTS WHO MIGRATE TO COHORT 2: Total bilirubin level =< institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)\n* PATIENTS WHO MIGRATE TO COHORT 2: AST and ALT must be =< 5.0 x ULN\n* PATIENTS WHO MIGRATE TO COHORT 2: Creatinine clearance (CrCL) of ≥30 mL/min by the Cockcroft-Gault formula\n* PATIENTS WHO MIGRATE TO COHORT 2: A LVEF performed within the last 3 months must be >= 50% regardless of the cardiac imaging facility's lower limit of normal (LVEF assessment performed by echocardiogram is preferred; however, MUGA scan may be substituted based on institutional/situational preferences)\n* PATIENTS WHO MIGRATE TO COHORT 2: Pregnancy test according to institutional standards must be negative (for patients of childbearing potential only)\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
