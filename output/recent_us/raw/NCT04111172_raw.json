    "official_title": "A Phase II Trial of IDO-Inhibitor, BMS-986205, and PD-1 Inhibitor, Nivolumab, in Patients With Recurrent or Persistent Endometrial Cancer or Endometrial Carcinosarcomas (CA017-056)",

Histologic documentation of diagnosis of carcinoma is required.\n* All patients must have measurable disease. Measurable disease is defined by RECIST (version 1.1). Measurable disease is defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded). Each lesion must be ≥ 10 mm when measured by CT, MRI or caliper measurement by clinical exam; or ≥ 20 mm when measured by chest x-ray. Lymph nodes must be ≥ 15 mm in short axis when measured by CT or MRI.\n* Patients must have at least one \"target lesion\" to be used to assess response on this protocol as defined by RECIST version 1.1 (Section 12.0). Tumors within a previously irradiated field will be designated as \"non-target\" lesions unless progression is documented, or a biopsy is obtained to confirm persistence at least 90 days following completion of radiation therapy.\n* Females, age ≥ 18 years and life expectancy of ≥ 12 weeks.\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.\n* Resolution of (non-laboratory) adverse effects of recent surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy to Grade ≤1 prior to first study treatment (with the exception of alopecia or neuropathy).\n* Patients must have had one prior platinum-based chemotherapeutic regimen for management of endometrial carcinoma or carcinosarcoma. Initial treatment may include chemotherapy, chemotherapy and radiation therapy, and/or consolidation/maintenance therapy. Chemotherapy administered in conjunction with primary radiation as a radiosensitizer WILL be counted as a systemic chemotherapy regimen.\n* Patients are allowed to have up to three prior cytotoxic regimens for management of recurrent or persistent disease. Hormonal therapies will not count toward the prior regimen limit.\n* Adequate normal organ and marrow function defined by the following laboratory results obtained within 14 days prior to first treatment:\n\n  * Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 10^9/L (> 1500 per mm^3)\n  * Platelet ≥ 75 x 10^9/L (>100,000 per mm^3)\n  * Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN). (Unless Gilbert's Syndrome, for which Bilirubin ≤ 3 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN), without concurrent clinically significant liver disease)\n  * AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) ≤ 3 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) unless liver metastases are present, in which case it must be ≤ 5x ULN\n  * Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)\n* Female subjects must either be of non-reproductive potential (i.e., post-menopausal by history: ≥60 years old and no menses for ≥1 year without an alternative medical cause and confirmed by FSH levels; OR history of hysterectomy, OR history of bilateral tubal ligation, OR history of bilateral oophorectomy) or must have a negative serum pregnancy test upon study entry.\n* Archival tissue, 15-20 unstained FFPE slides, must be available. If archival tissue is not available, patient will be required to undergo.\n* Subject is willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study including undergoing treatment, procedures (including on-treatment biopsy), and scheduled visits and examinations including follow up.\n* Patients must have been enrolled or agree to consent to the companion genomic profiling study MSKCC IRB# 12-245 - Patients must have signed an approved informed consent and authorization permitting release of personal information.\n* Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must agree to follow instructions for method(s) of contraception (See IDO Appendix 1) for the duration of treatment with study treatment(s) plus 5 months post-treatment completion.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be FEMALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Involvement in the planning and/or conduct of the study (applies to both Bristol-Myers Squibb staff and/or staff at the study site);\n* Known MMR-deficient patient and / or MSI-H will be excluded. Results of IMPACT #12-245 do not need to have resulted prior to enrollment. If results of IMPACT #12-245 shows MSI-H and / or MMR-deficient and patient has already started study, patient can continue on treatment\n* Prior enrollment in the present study or another clinical study with receipt of an investigational product during the last 4 weeks.\n* Any previous treatment with an IDO, PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor, or any anti-CTLA4.\n* History of another primary malignancy except for:\n\n  * Malignancy treated with curative intent and with no known active disease ≥3 years before the first dose of study drug and of low potential risk for recurrence\n  * Adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer or lentigo maligna without evidence of disease\n  * Adequately treated carcinoma in situ without evidence of disease (e.g., cervical cancer in situ)\n  * Adequately treated stage 1 breast cancer.\n* Receipt of the last dose of anti-cancer therapy (chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapy, biologic therapy, tumor embolization, radiation therapy, monoclonal antibodies) < 21 days prior to the first dose of study drug.
