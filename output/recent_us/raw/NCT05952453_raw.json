Stable brain metastases should be established prior to the first dose of study medication.\n\n     Note: Participants with known untreated, asymptomatic brain metastases (i.e., no neurological symptoms, no requirement for corticosteroids, no or minimal surrounding edema, and no lesion >1.5 cm) may participate but will require regular imaging of the brain as a site of disease.\n  6.

Use of antihypertensive medications to control blood pressure is allowed. Participant has current, clinically relevant bowel obstruction (including sub-occlusive disease), abdominal fistula or gastrointestinal perforation, related to underlying EOC.\n\n      Note: This applies to participants who will receive bevacizumab.\n  28. Participant has a history of hemorrhage, hemoptysis or active gastrointestinal bleeding within 6 months prior to enrollment Note: This applies only to participants who will receive bevacizumab.\n  29.
