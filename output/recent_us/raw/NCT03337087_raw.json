Coadministration of cobimetinib with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor can increase cobimetinib systemic exposure significantly (e.g. itraconazole increased serum systemic cobimetinib exposure by 6.7 fold). On the other end, coadministration of cobimetinib with a strong CYP3A inducer may decrease cobimetinib systemic exposure by more than 80% thus reducing its efficacy. Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated list such as http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/; medical reference texts such as the Physicians' Desk Reference may also provide this information. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product\n\n  * Patients on mild inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A are allowed\n* Patients with a known clinically significant liver disease, including active viral, alcoholic, or other hepatitis; cirrhosis; fatty liver; and inherited liver disease.\n\n  * Patients with past or resolved hepatitis B infection (defined as having a negative hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] test and a positive anti-HBc [antibody to hepatitis B core antigen] antibody test) are eligible.\n  * Patients positive for hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody are eligible only if polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is negative for HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA)\n* Patients who have received immunosuppressive treatment for systemic autoimmune disease, including, but not limited to, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, vascular thrombosis associated with antiphospholipid syndrome, Wegener's granulomatosis, Sjogren's syndrome, multiple sclerosis, vasculitis, or glomerulonephritis within the last 2 years.\n\n  * Patients with a history autoimmune endocrine disorders on stable doses of physiologic hormone replacement may be eligible.\n  * Patients with controlled type 1 diabetes mellitus on a stable insulin regimen may be eligible.\n  * Patients with eczema, psoriasis, lichen simplex chronicus of vitiligo with dermatologic manifestations only (e.g., patients with psoriatic arthritis would be excluded) are permitted provided that they meet the following conditions:\n\n    * Patients with psoriasis must have a baseline ophthalmologic exam to rule out ocular manifestations\n    * Rash must cover less than 10% of body surface area (BSA)\n    * Disease is well controlled at baseline and only requiring low potency topical steroids (e.g., hydrocortisone 2.5%, hydrocortisone butyrate 0.1%, fluocinolone 0.01%, desonide 0.05%, alclometasone dipropionate 0.05%)\n    * No acute exacerbations of underlying condition within the last 12 months (not requiring psoralen plus ultraviolet A radiation [PUVA], methotrexate, retinoids, biologic agents, oral calcineurin inhibitors; high potency or oral steroids)\n  * Patients with history Guillain-Barre syndrome or myasthenia gravis at any point will not be eligible\n* History of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, pneumonitis (including drug induced), organizing pneumonia (i.e., bronchiolitis obliterans, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, etc.), or evidence of active pneumonitis on screening chest computed tomography (CT) scan.
