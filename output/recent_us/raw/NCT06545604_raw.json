    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Clinically staged breast cancer that does not meet all of the criteria delineated in Inclusion criteria 3.\n2. Prior invasive non-breast malignancy (except non-melanomatous skin cancer, carcinoma in situ of the cervix) unless disease free for a minimum of 5 years prior to study entry\n3. Prior invasive or in-situ carcinoma of the breast (prior LCIS is eligible) unless disease free for a minimum of 5 years prior to study entry.\n4. Non-epithelial breast malignancies such as sarcoma or lymphoma.\n5. Two or more documented breast cancers within the index breast or bilateral breast cancer.\n6. Suspicious unresected microcalcifications, densities, or palpable abnormalities (in the ipsilateral or contralateral breast) unless biopsied and found to be benign.\n7. Paget's disease of the nipple.\n8. Male breast cancer.\n9. Evidence of distant metastases.\n10. Clinical regional lymph node involvement.\n11. Prior RT to the region of the breast that would result in overlap of RT fields.\n12. Intention to administer concurrent chemotherapy for current breast cancer.\n13. Severe, active co-morbidity, defined as follows:\n\n    13.1. Unstable angina and/or congestive heart failure requiring hospitalization within the last 6 months\n\n    13.2.

Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) based upon current CDC definition; note, however, that HIV testing is not required for entry into this protocol. The need to exclude patients with AIDS from this protocol is necessary because the treatments involved in this protocol may be significantly immunosuppressive. Protocol-specific requirements may also exclude immunocompromised patients.\n14. Active connective tissue disorders/collagen vascular disease, specifically dermatomyositis with a CPK level above normal or with an active skin rash, systemic lupus erythematosis, or scleroderma.\n15. Medical, psychiatric or other condition that would prevent the patient from receiving the protocol therapy or providing informed consent.\n16. Unable to delineate tumor on pre-RT MRI and CT simulation scan.",
