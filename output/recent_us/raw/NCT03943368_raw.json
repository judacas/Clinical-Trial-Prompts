    "inclusion_criteria": "* Age ≥18 years with no impairment in decision making capacity\n* Patients with HER2 overexpressed/amplified/mutant metastatic breast/lung/esophagogastric/colorectal cancer (IHC, fluorescent in situ hybridation or sequencing-confirmed primary, brain, or other metastatic site) and one or more brain tumor(s) planned for neurosurgical resection. Other untreated brain metastases, and prior radiation (whole brain radiation therapy and/or stereotactic radiosurgery) to the index site are allowed\n* Patients with concomitant leptomeningeal disease are eligible provided they have parenchymal brain metastases requiring resection.\n* Life expectancy of >12 weeks.\n* ECOG Performance Status (PS) of 0 to 2\n* Prior treatments:\n\n  * Cohort A: Clinical and or radiological CNS parenchymal progression on tucatinib as most recent line of treatment (tucatinib-resistant) in patients with HER2 overexpressed/amplified breast cancer\n  * Clinical and or radiological CNS parenchymal progression with no prior tucatinib (tucatinib naïve) in patients with HER2 overexpressed/amplified breast cancer\n  * Clinical and or radiological CNS parenchymal progression in patients with HER2+/mutant lung/esophagogastric/colorectal cancer and HER2 mutant breast cancer\n\nALL PATIENTS:\n\n* Prior conventional dose lapatinib and neratinib are allowed in any cohort if > 6 months prior\n* No limit on prior lines of systemic therapy\n* Adequate bone marrow, liver, renal function, and coagulation parameters (obtained ≤ 7 days prior to the first day of study treatment:\n\n  1. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1.0 × 103μL, Platelet count ≥75 × 103 /μL, Hemoglobin ≥ 8.0 g/dL\n  2. Total bilirubin ≤1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN). Subjects with known history of Gilbert's Syndrome and normal direct bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) are eligible: AST and ALT ≤2.5 × ULN (≤5 × ULN if liver metastases are present)\n  3. Calculated creatinine clearance ≥50 mL/min using the CKD-EPI (2021) (in Cohort A, in patients with elevated serum creatinine, eGFR can be calculated using cystatin C to confirm eligibility)\n  4. International normalized ratio (INR) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) ≤1.5 × ULN unless on medication known to alter INR and/or aPTT\n* Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test performed within 7 days prior to enrollment and must agree to use adequate contraception prior to enrollment and for the duration of study participation\n* Patients must be able to swallow and retain oral medication\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be FEMALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Contraindications or history of allergic reaction to tucatinib or any of its excipients\n* Significant medical co-morbidities as per investigator evaluation\n* Inability to comply with protocol and /or not willing or not available for follow-up assessments or any condition which in the investigator's opinion makes the patient unsuitable for the study participation\n* Have used a strong or moderate CYP2C8 inhibitor within 5 half-lives of the inhibitor or have used a strong or moderate CYP2C8 or CYP3A4 inducer within 2 weeks prior to first dose of study treatment (Appendix E)\n* Receiving concomitant CYP3A or P-gp substrates where minimal concentration changes may lead to serious or life-threatening toxicities\n* Concurrent pregnancy",
