    "official_title": "Use of Amide-CEST MRI and 18F-Fluciclovine PET for Discerning Tumor From Treatment Change in Patients With Brain Metastases Undergoing Immunotherapy",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Age 18 years or older\n* Able and willing to provide informed consent\n* Has a brain metastasis diagnosis with at least one single visible contrast enhancing metastatic lesion on brain MRI\n* Received radiation therapy at some point in the last 2 years\n* Is currently being treated with or has been treated with any other concurrent systemic therapy (multi-modal therapy) in the past 6 months, which would include immunotherapy, targeted therapy, or systemic chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or chemotherapy following radiation therapy.\n* Patients are eligible for the study if their most recent standard-of-care MRI, used to assess disease location and extent, raises the question of tumor recurrence versus treatment-related changes. This concern can be noted by the radiologist or other members of the multidisciplinary care team, such as during a multidisciplinary conference. Additionally, if there are clinical concerns based on evolving exam findings or symptoms, and the treating physician suspects progression versus treatment-induced changes, the patient is also eligible for the study.\n* Be able to lie still for 30-60 minutes during the imaging procedure\n* Willing and able to undergo PET/MRI\n* Patients requiring intravenous (IV) conscious sedation for imaging are not eligible; patients requiring mild, oral anxiolytics for the clinical MRI will be allowed to participate as long as the following criteria are met:\n\n  * The subject has their own prescription for the medication\n  * The informed consent process is conducted prior to the self-administration of this medication\n  * They come to the research visit with a driver\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Subject unable or unwilling to provide informed consent\n* Subject is pregnant\n* Subject with contraindication(s) to or inability to undergo a PET or MRI\n* Known allergy to 18F-Fluciclovine or any of its excipients",
