    "inclusion_criteria": "* Have given informed consent by signing and dating an informed consent form before initiation of any study-specific procedures.\n* Male or female, aged ≥18 years at the time of giving informed consent.\n* Are willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, the treatment schedule, the planned study assessments (including participant completed diaries) and other requirements of the study. This includes that they are able to understand and follow study-related instructions.\n* Have confirmed locally recurrent inoperable or mTNBC as defined by the most recent American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) / College of American Pathologists (CAP) guidelines. Note, participants initially diagnosed with hormone receptor positive and/or HER2-positive breast cancer must have histological confirmation of TNBC in a tumor biopsy obtained from a local recurrence or distant metastasis site.\n\n  * Systemic treatment naïve locally advanced/metastatic participants are eligible if:\n\n    * They have received no prior systemic therapy in the locally advanced unresectable/metastatic setting including chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or investigational agents.\n    * They have completed treatment for Stage I-III breast cancer, if indicated, and ≥6 months has elapsed between the completion of treatment with curative intent (e.g., date of primary breast tumor surgery or date of last adjuvant chemotherapy administration, whichever occurred last) and first documented local or distant disease recurrence.\n  * Participants who received one prior systemic therapy in the locally advanced/metastatic setting are eligible if they have received systemic chemotherapy or immunotherapy in the first-line setting. If immunotherapy was given - a minimum of two doses of a programmed death 1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor must have been administered in the first-line locally advanced unresectable/metastatic setting. Radiographic progression must have been documented. Radiographic progression is defined as unequivocal progression of existing tumor lesions or developing new tumor lesions as assessed by the investigator.\n* Have provided a tissue sample, archival or fresh, during the screening period (bone biopsies, fine needle aspiration biopsies, and samples from pleural or peritoneal fluid are not acceptable; participants with only one target lesion are not eligible to provide a biopsy). The participants most recent formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tumor sample should be provided (up to a maximum of 24 months prior to the start of the study; unstained sections, 3-5 µm or tissue block). If an archival tumor sample is not available, the participant must undergo a fresh biopsy, if medically feasible to be eligible for the study.\n* Have at least one measurable lesion as the targeted lesion based on RECIST version 1.1. Lesions treated after prior local treatment (radiotherapy, ablation, interventional procedures) are generally not considered as target lesions. If the lesion with prior local treatment is the only targeted lesion, evidence-based radiology must be provided to demonstrate disease progression (the single bone metastasis or the single central nervous system metastasis should not be considered as a measurable lesion).\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1.\n* Have a minimum life expectancy of >3 months.\n* Have adequate organ function, as defined below:\n\n  * Hematology:\n\n    * Absolute neutrophil count ≥1.5 × 10^9/L (without G-CSF support within two weeks prior to Cycle 1, Day 1).\n    * Platelet count ≥100 × 10^9/L (without transfusion within 2 weeks prior to Cycle 1, Day 1).\n    * Hemoglobin ≥90 g/L or 5.6 mmol/L. Note: Criterion must be met without packed red blood cell transfusion or without erythropoietin dependency within the prior 2 weeks before receiving the first dose of study treatment.\n  * Liver function:\n\n    * Total bilirubin ≤1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN).\n    * With Gilbert's syndrome total bilirubin <3 mg/dL and direct bilirubin ≤ULN. Note, Gilbert's syndrome must be documented appropriately as past medical history.\n    * Participants without liver metastasis alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase ≤2 × ULN.\n    * Participants with liver metastasis alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase ≤5 × ULN.\n    * Albumin ≥3.0 g/dL.\n  * Renal function: Creatinine clearance ≥50 mL/min. Cockcroft-Gault formula. Note, in participants who will be treated with gemcitabine plus carboplatin, creatinine clearance should be ≥60 mL/min.\n  * Qualitative urine protein ≤1+. If qualitative urine protein ≥2+, a 24-hour urine protein quantitative test is required. If the 24-hour urine protein result is <1 g, the participant can be enrolled.\n  * Coagulation function: International normalized ratio or prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time ≤1.5 × ULN unless the participant is receiving anticoagulation therapy as long as prothrombin or activated partial thromboplastin is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulant.\n* Are women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) who have a negative serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin pregnancy test. Women who are postmenopausal (defined as 12 months with no menses without an alternative medical cause) or permanently sterilized (verified by medical records) will not be considered WOCBP and therefore will not be required to undergo pregnancy testing.\n* Are WOCBP who agree to practice a highly effective form of contraception and to require their male sexual partners to use barrier contraception methods (preferably condoms), starting at at the time of giving informed consent and continuously until 6 months after receiving the last study treatment.\n* Are men who are sterile or if they are potentially fertile (i.e., are not surgically [e.g., have had a vasectomy] or congenitally sterile) and sexually active with a partner of childbearing potential, who agree to use condoms and to ask their sexual partners to practice a highly effective form of contraception during the study, starting at the time of giving informed consent and continuously until 6 months after receiving the last dose of IMP.\n* Agree not to donate germ (ova, oocytes, sperm) for the purposes of assisted reproduction during study, starting at the time of giving informed consent and continuously until 6 months after receiving the last dose of IMP.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
