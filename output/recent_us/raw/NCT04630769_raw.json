Clinically meaningful ascites is defined as ascites from cirrhosis requiring increasing dosage of diuretics or paracentesis.\n* Has symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Patients with asymptomatic CNS lesions will be eligible if considered appropriate by the treating physician. Patients with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they have had a stable neurological status for at least 2 weeks after completion of definitive therapy. Patients may be on corticosteroids (≤ 10 mg of prednisone-equivalent) to control brain metastases if they have been on a stable dose for 2 weeks (14 days) prior to the start of study treatment and are clinically asymptomatic. This exception does not include carcinomatous meningitis which is excluded regardless of clinical stability.\n* Pregnancy or breastfeeding or intention of becoming pregnant during study treatment or within 180 days for Cemiplimab after the final dose of study treatment\n\n  * Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test result within 14 days prior to initiation of study treatment.\n  * Highly effective contraception should be used in women of childbearing potential during treatment with Cemiplimab and for at least 6 months following the last dose of Cemiplimab.\n* Any patient who has experienced unacceptable toxicity on prior checkpoint inhibitor therapy as detailed below:\n\n  1. ≥ Grade 3 AE related to checkpoint inhibitor.\n  2. Ongoing ≥ Grade 2 immune-related AE associated with checkpoint inhibitor with the exception of endocrine toxicities as detailed below.\n  3.
