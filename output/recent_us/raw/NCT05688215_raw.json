    "inclusion_criteria": "* INCLUSION CRITERIA:\n* Diagnosis\n\n  * Participant must:\n\n    * Have pathology confirmed B cell ALL (not isolated to the testis or CNS), CML with ALL transformation, or high-grade lymphoma (e.g., Burkitt s lymphoma, B-lymphoblastic lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, inclusive of low-grade lymphoma that has transformed to high grade disease); and\n    * Have relapsed or been refractory after at least one standard chemotherapy regimen and at least one salvage treatment. Participants with Philadelphia chromosome + ALL must have failed prior tyrosine kinase inhibitor; and\n    * Be ineligible for allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT), have refused SCT, or have recurred after SCT; and\n    * Have no evidence of graft-versus- host disease (GVHD) and have been without immunosuppressive agents for at least 30 days prior to apheresis, if undergone prior allogeneic SCT; and\n    * Be unable to access (in a timely manner), ineligible for, or have relapsed/failed after or not responded to a commercially available CD19 CAR T-cell construct; and\n  * Have evidence of at least minimal residual disease or PET-avid disease (lymphoma) at the time of enrollment.\n* CD22/CD19 expression\n\n  * CD19 must be detected on >15% of the malignant cells by immunohistochemistry or > 80% by flow cytometry.\n  * CD22 positivity must be confirmed.\n* Age >= 3 years of age and <=39 years of age at time of enrollment.\n* Clinical Performance status: Participants >= 16 years of age: Karnofsky >= 50%;

No washout for prior intrathecal chemotherapy, steroid therapy, hydroxyurea (no dose increases within prior 2 weeks) or ALL maintenance-type chemotherapy (vincristine, 6-mercaptopurine, oral methotrexate, or a tyrosine kinase inhibitor for participants with Ph+ ALL) provided there is recovery from any acute toxic effects\n  * Therapy: Radiation\n  * Washout*: >=3 weeks\n  * Exceptions: No time restriction with radiation therapy if the volume of bone marrow treated is less than 10% and the participant has measurable/evaluable disease outside the radiation window\n  * Therapy: Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplant\n  * Washout*: >= 100 days since SCT; >= 30 days since completion of immunosuppression; >= 6 weeks since donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI)\n  * Exceptions: Cannot have evidence of active graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)\n  * Therapy: CAR T-Cell Therapy or other Adoptive Cell Therapy\n  * Washout*: > 30 days post infusion\n\n    * Washout: Time between therapy and apheresis\n* Positive HIV antibodies consistent with active HIV.\n* Positive hepatitis C antibodies or positive Hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAG) indicative of current/active HCV/HBV.\n* Active second malignancy other than in situ carcinoma of the cervix, unless the tumor was treated with curative intent at least two years previously and participant is in remission.\n* History of severe, immediate hypersensitivity reaction attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to any agents used in study or in the manufacturing of the cells.\n* Uncontrolled, symptomatic, intercurrent illness or social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements or in the opinion of the PI would pose an unacceptable risk to the participant.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 3 Years\nMust have maximum age of 39 Years",
