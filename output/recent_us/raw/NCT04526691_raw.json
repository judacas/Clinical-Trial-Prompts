    "exclusion_criteria": "* Presence of active clinically significant CNS dysfunction\n* Pregnant or breast-feeding\n* Unable to tolerate apheresis procedure\n* Presence of active malignancy other than CD19+CD22+ leukemia\n* Presence of active severe infection\n* Presence of any concurrent medical condition that, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator, would prevent the patient from undergoing protocol-specified therapy",
