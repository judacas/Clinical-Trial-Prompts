    "official_title": "Real-Time Assessment Of Breast Cancer Lumpectomy Specimen Margins With Nonlinear Microscopy",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Patient scheduled to undergo lumpectomy for breast cancer at BIDMC.\n* Core needle biopsy revealing invasive breast cancer or DCIS.\n* Female.\n* Minimum age of 21 years.\n* Eligible for breast conserving surgery, lumpectomy and radiation.\n* Estrogen receptor positive (ER+) on core needle biopsy, or if estrogen receptor negative (ER-), have evaluable estrogen receptor status with positive internal control on core biopsy.\n* Progesterone receptor positive (PR+) on core needle biopsy if biopsy indicates invasive cancer, or if progesterone receptor negative (PR-) on biopsy indicating invasive cancer, have evaluable progesterone receptor status with positive internal control on core biopsy.\n* HER2 IHC and/or FISH ordered on core biopsy, if biopsy indicates invasive cancer.\n* Oncotype DX or other genetic assay performed on core biopsy or not requested.\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be FEMALE\nMust have minimum age of 21 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Contraindicated for radiation therapy.\n* Pregnancy. (Pregnant women will be excluded from this study because radiation therapy is contraindicated during pregnancy.)\n* Current invasive cancer or DCIS at the site of a previous surgery.\n* Any systemic neoadjuvant (or preoperative) therapy between the core biopsy and lumpectomy.\n* Involvement in another therapeutic trial for breast cancer at Dana Farber or elsewhere.\n* Risk of poor cosmetic outcome after initial lumpectomy and possible additional excision, as assessed by a study surgeon.\n* Recommendation for mastectomy based on radiology.\n* Patients that have complex DCIS as indicated on radiology, which would require excising a large tissue volume.\n* No or equivocal ER, PR or HER2 testing performed prior to surgery if biopsy indicates invasive cancer.\n* No or equivocal ER testing performed prior to surgery if biopsy indicates ductal carcinoma in situ.",
