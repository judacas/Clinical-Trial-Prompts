    "official_title": "The Impact of a Gravity Versus Vacuum Based Indwelling Tunneled Pleural Drainage System on Pain: A Multicenter, Randomized Trial",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Clinical indications for placement of IPC for malignant pleural effusion\n\n  a. Pleural effusion with symptomatic improvement in dyspnea after drainage of ipsilateral effusion\n* Clinically confident symptomatic malignant pleural effusion\n\n  1. Histocytological proof of pleural malignancy\n  2. Recurrent large pleural effusion in context of histologically proven cancer outside the pleural space\n* Plans for placement of IPC within ten days of enrollment\n* Age > 17 years\n* Sufficient fluid on ultrasound to allow for safe insertion of IPC\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Recent (less than 60 days) thoracic surgery or chest trauma causing chronic pain\n* Pregnant or lactating mothers\n* Previous ipsilateral chemical pleurodesis\n* Current contralateral indwelling pleural catheter\n* Known rib or thoracic skeletal metastasis causing pain\n* Concern for active pleural infection\n* Respiratory failure\n* Irreversible bleeding diathesis\n* Inability to provide care for indwelling tunneled pleural catheter\n* Significantly loculated pleural space precluding drainage of pleural space, for which IPC alone will likely not offer symptomatic benefit\n* Estimated life expectancy of < 30 days (however, active enrollment in hospice program is not an exclusion criteria)\n* Inability to read/understand/write in the English language\n* Inability to follow-up for appointments/protocol\n* Subject has any clinical condition, diagnosis, or social circumstance that, in the opinion of the investigator would mean participation in the study would be contraindicated.\n* Enrollment in alternative pleural catheter trial that would preclude enrollment within this trial",
