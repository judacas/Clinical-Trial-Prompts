Previous administration of any radionuclide within 10 half-lives of the same\n8. Serious non-malignant disease (e.g. psychiatric, infectious, autoimmune or metabolic) that may interfere with the objectives of the study or within the safety of compliance of the subjects as judged by the Investigator\n9. Mental impairment that may compromise the ability to give Informed Consent and comply with the requirements of the study\n10. Exposure to any experimental diagnostic or therapeutic drug within 30 days from the date of planned administration of 89Zr-TLX250\n11. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding\n12.
