Has received systemic immunosuppressants within 2 weeks. Allowed are local use of glucocorticoids administered by nasal, inhaled, or other routes, and systemic glucocorticoids at physiological doses (no more than 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalents), or glucocorticoids to prevent allergies to contrast media.\n6. Has received a live attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment or is scheduled to receive live attenuated vaccine during the study period.\n\n   Note: Seasonal inactivated influenza virus vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment are permitted, but attenuated influenza vaccines are not.\n7. Has undergone major surgery (craniotomy, thoracotomy, or laparotomy) within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment or is scheduled to receive major surgery during the course of the trial.\n8.
