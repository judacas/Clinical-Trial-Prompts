    "official_title": "A Safety and Tolerability Study of Sotrovimab (VIR-7831) Prophylaxis Against COVID-19 Infection in Immunocompromised Individuals With Impaired SARS-CoV-2 Humoral Immunity",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Participant must be 18 years of age or older at the time of consent and weigh at least 40 kg. Children will be excluded from this study because dosing and adverse event data are limited for the use of sotrovimab in participants <18 years of age.\n* Participant must have one of the following immunocompromising conditions that increases their likelihood of having an impaired humoral immune response to SARS-CoV-2, while also increasing their risk of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 and risk of progression to severe COVID-19:\n\n  1. Exposure to an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (e.g. all formulations of rituximab, obinutuzumab, ofatumumab, ocrelizumab, ibritumomab, tositumomab) for a hematologic malignancy or an autoimmune/inflammatory disease in the 12-month period prior to consent.\n  2. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant ≥ 3 months and ≤ 1 year prior to consent; or allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant >1 year prior to consent plus active graft-versus host disease on systemic immunosuppressive therapy.\n  3. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy ≥ 4 weeks and ≤ 2 years prior to consent.\n  4. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL), multiple myeloma, or Waldenström macroglobulinemia.\n  5. Solid organ transplant recipient receiving immunosuppressive therapy.\n  6. Congenital immunodeficiency syndrome (e.g. Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, DiGeorge syndrome, common variable immunodeficiency).\n  7. Patients with hematologic malignancy or autoimmune/inflammatory disease exposed to immunosuppressive medications specifically associated with a blunted humoral immune response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination (e.g. mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, methotrexate, Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors, ruxolitinib, venetoclax, or corticosteroids (prednisone >20mg or equivalent daily for at least 14 days) in the 3-month period prior to consent.\n* Female participants must be:\n\n  1. Postmenopausal for at least 1 year;\n  2. Post-hysterectomy and/or post-bilateral oophorectomy;\n  3. Of childbearing potential, with a negative urine or serum human chorionic gonadotropin pregnancy test prior to each sotrovimab dose, and agree to use a highly effective method of birth control throughout the study period.\n* Participants must have a negative or low-positive (<50 U/mL) SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody assay result within 28 days of consent.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Participants with an active SARS-CoV-2 infection, with a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR or antigen test result within 21 days prior to consent.\n* Participants with symptoms suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n* Close contact (less than 6 feet away for a cumulative total of ≥ 15 minutes over a 24-hour period) with an individual with COVID-19 in the 14 days prior to consent.\n* Individuals who are pregnant or breastfeeding.\n* Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.\n* Participants who, in the judgment of the investigator, are likely to have a life expectancy of less than one year.\n* Known hypersensitivity to any constituent present in sotrovimab or any other anti-SARSCoV-2 monoclonal antibody product.\n* Active enrollment on another interventional research study of any agent for the treatment or prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n* Exposure to any other anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody product for the treatment of COVID-19 in the prior 6 months.\n* Exposure to any other anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody product for prophylaxis against COVID-19 infection in the prior 12 months.\n* Receipt of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dose within the prior 28 days.",
