    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Signed written informed consent by parent(s)/legal guardians of the pediatric patient in compliance with the local laws and regulations. In addition signed children's assent form according to local requirements.\n2. Male or female in- or out-patient from birth to < 18 years at the time of randomization.\n3.

For patient aged ≥ 10 years: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) ≤ 2.\n7. For patient aged 2 years with known mild to moderate hepatic impairment: in the Investigator's opinion the impairment does not jeopardize patient's safety during the study.\n8. For patient aged 2 years with known mild to moderate renal impairment: in the Investigator's opinion the impairment should not jeopardize patient's safety during the study.\n9. For patient with known history or predisposition to cardiac abnormalities: in the Investigator's opinion the history/predisposition should not jeopardize patient's safety during the study.\n10.
