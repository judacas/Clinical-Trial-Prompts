    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Cirrhosis due to any underlying etiology diagnosed by one or more of the following:\n\n   * Histology of liver biopsy\n   * Radiologic criteria (nodular liver, evidence of portal hypertension)\n   * Clinical signs of cirrhosis (gastroesophageal varices, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy)\n   * Vibration controlled transient elastography (VCTE, specifically Fibroscan, which is available in all participating sites) with liver stiffness >12.5kPa or magnetic resonance elastography >5.0 kPa\n2. High Risk of Liver Cancer: This will be defined by one or more of the following:\n\n   * Current HCV infection (detectable HCV RNA)\n   * FIB-4 score 3.25, within 6 months of randomization\n   * Estimated annual HCC incidence >2.5%, within 6 months of randomization, calculated by VA-specific models that the investigators developed (available on the national VA ALD Dashboard and at www.hccrisk.com).\n3. Age 18-75\n4. Able to provide informed consent\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 75 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Prior diagnosis or of HCC\n2. Current suspicion of HCC\n3. Prior receipt of organ transplantation\n4. Currently listed for organ transplantation.\n5. Participation in a conflicting HCC screening trial\n6. Advanced liver dysfunction, defined by Child C Cirrhosis (CTP score 10), or MELD score >20, within 6 months prior to randomization\n7. Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) <30 ml/min\n8. Multiple comorbid conditions resulting in limited life expectancy, defined by a cirrhosis-specific comorbidity index (CirCom)112 score 3. Of note, early stage malignancies of the bladder, lung, or prostate will not be excluded.\n9. Estimated life expectancy <5 years as determined by the clinical judgement of the Study Investigator\n10. Contraindications to undergoing contrast-enhanced MRI:\n\n    * Allergy to gadolinium-based contrast agents\n    * MRI-incompatible implantable devices (e.g. pacemakers, defibrillators, resynchronization devices)\n    * Implantable neurostimulation device\n    * Implantable cochlear implant/ear implant\n    * Drug infusion pumps (e.g. insulin pump, analgesic or chemotherapy pumps)\n    * Metallic foreign bodies in or around the eye\n    * Metallic fragments, such as bullets, shotgun pellets or shrapnel\n    * Metallic body piercings that cannot be removed\n    * Cerebral artery aneurysm clips\n    * Severe claustrophobia\n    * Unable to fit on MRI machine due to weight (weight >400lbs) or body habitus\n11. Inability to complete planned study visits (e.g. lives too far from VA, no transportation, etc.)\n12. Currently pregnant",
