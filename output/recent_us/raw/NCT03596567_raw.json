    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Male or female subjects ≥18 years of age.\n2. Documented carcinoid syndrome requiring medical therapy.\n\n   1. Not currently treated with somatostatin receptor ligands agonists for at least 12 weeks prior to screening and actively symptomatic. This can include treatment-naïve subjects.\n   2. Subjects currently treated with lanreotide, octreotide long acting release, or short acting octreotide (subcutaneous or oral) who are currently symptomatically controlled\n3. Evaluable documentation of locally advanced or metastatic histopathologically confirmed well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor (NET).\n4. No significant disease progression as assessed by the Investigator within the last 6 months before initiation of study drug dosing.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Diarrhea attributed to any condition(s) other than carcinoid syndrome.\n2. Uncontrolled/severe diarrhea associated with significant volume contraction, dehydration, or hypotension.\n3. Requires second line treatments (eg, telotristat) for control of carcinoid syndrome symptoms.\n4. Treatment with specific NET tumor therapy <4 weeks before Screening (such as everolimus or sunitinib) or hepatic embolization, radiotherapy, peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT), and/or tumor debulking <12 weeks before Screening.\n5. History of another primary malignancy <3 years prior to the date of first dose, except for adequately treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, cancer of the breast or cervix in situ, previously treated or concurrent malignancy determined to be clinically stable and not requiring treatment.\n6. Diabetes mellitus treated with insulin for less than 6 weeks prior to the study entry",
