Patients who fit these criteria must use Hep B prophylaxis during treatment. Subjects with a positive HBsAg due to recent vaccination are eligible if HBV DNA (viral load) is below the lower limit of quantification, per local testing\n* Positive hepatitis C antibody (anti-HCV)\n\n  o NOTE: Subjects with a prior history of HCV, who have completed antiviral treatment and have subsequently documented HCV RNA below the lower limit of quantification per local testing are eligible\n* Participant is positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), with 1 or more of the following:\n\n  * Receiving ART that may interfere with study treatment (consult sponsor for review of medication prior to enrollment)\n  * CD4 count < 350 cells/mm3 at screening\n  * AIDS-defining opportunistic infection within 6 months of start of screening\n  * Not agreeing to start ART and be on ART > 4 weeks plus having HIV viral load <400 copies/mL at end of 4-week period (to ensure ART is tolerated and HIV controlled)\n* Myocardial infarction, unstable angina, stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft, or any acute coronary syndrome within 6 months of start of study drug\n* Congestive heart failure defined as New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III-IV or hospitalization for congestive heart failure (any NYHA class) within 6 months of study Day 1\n* Pregnant women or women who are breastfeeding or of childbearing potential and not using a highly effective method of birth control for at least one month prior to enrollment.
