    "inclusion_criteria": "Patients eligible for definitive chemoradiotherapy, including brachytherapy\n\n* Patient age ≥ 18 years.\n* Patients with histologically confirmed newly diagnosed advanced cervical cancer (squamous, adenosquamous, adenocarcinoma or poorly differentiated); Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) 2018 clinical stages III-IVA.\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 2\n* Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcL.\n* Platelets ≥ 100,000/mcL.\n* Hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL (can be transfused prior to study).\n* Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN); patients with known Gilbert disease with serum bilirubin ≤ 3 x ULN may be enrolled.\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT]/alanine aminotransfersase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT] ≤ 2.5 x ULN.\n* Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 x ULN.\n* Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL to receive weekly cisplatin; patients whose serum creatinine is between 1.5 and 1.9 mg/dL are eligible for cisplatin if there is no hydronephrosis and the estimated creatinine clearance (CCr) is ≥ 30 ml/min. For the purpose of estimating the CCr, formulas, including Cockcroft and Gault for females or similar, should be used.\n* International normalize ratio (INR) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) ≤ 1.5 x ULN (this applies only to patients who do not receive therapeutic anticoagulation; patients receiving therapeutic anticoagulation, such as low-molecular weight heparin or warfarin, should be on a stable dose).\n* Patient does not have uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (i.e. fasting blood glucose >200 mg/dL).\n* Patient does not have a known allergy to cisplatin or compounds of similar biologic composition as CB-839.\n* Patient is not actively breastfeeding (or has agreed to discontinue before the initiation of protocol therapy).\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n* Patients does not have known human immunodeficiency virus syndrome (HIV testing optional).\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Patient has another concurrent active invasive malignancy.\n* Patient has received prior radiation therapy to the pelvis or previous therapy of any kind for this malignancy, or pelvic radiation for any prior malignancy.\n* Patient is receiving another investigational agent for the treatment of cancer.\n* Poorly controlled diabetes, with inability to perform 18F-FDG PET scan.\n* Patient is pregnant or breastfeeding.\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* Mean resting QTc > 470 msec obtained by electrocardiogram (ECG).\n* Severe, active co-morbidity defined as follows:\n\n  * Current (within 28 days of cycle 1, day 1) signs and/or symptoms of bowel obstruction\n  * Patients who require parental hydration and/or nutrition\n  * Patients who require drainage gastrostomy tube\n  * Evidence of bleeding diathesis or clinically significant coagulopathy\n  * Serious, non-healing or dehiscing wound, active ulcer or untreated bone fracture\n  * History of hemoptysis (>= 1/2 teaspoon of bright red blood per episode) within 1 month of study enrollment\n  * Significant cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease including: Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure [SBP] >= 150; diastolic blood pressure [DBP] >= 90)",
