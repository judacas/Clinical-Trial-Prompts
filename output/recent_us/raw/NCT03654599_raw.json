Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.\n8. Patient is considered a poor medical risk that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the study.\n9. Patient has a condition or laboratory abnormality that might confound the study results, or interfere with the patient's participation for the full duration of the study treatment.\n10. Patient has not recovered (i.e, to ≤Grade 1 or to baseline) from previous intravesical BCG or other anti-cancer therapy induced AEs.\n11. Treatment with any approved anti-cancer therapy, including chemotherapy (systemic or intravesical), radiation therapy, or hormonal therapy within 3 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment\n12. Treatment with any other investigational agent or participation in another clinical study with therapeutic intent within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment\n13. Pregnant or lactating, or intending to become pregnant during the study\n\n    a. Women who are not postmenopausal (≥ 12 months of non-therapy-induced amenorrhea) or surgically sterile must have a negative serum pregnancy test result within 14 days prior to the first dose of study treatment.\n14.

Active hepatitis B (positive hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] test at screening);\n\n    a. Patients with past or resolved hepatitis B (HBV) infection (positive anti-hepatitis B core antigen [anti-HBc] antibody test) are eligible. HBV DNA must be obtained in these patients prior to the first dose of study treatment.\n23. Active hepatitis C\n\n    a. Patients positive for hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody are eligible only if polymerase chain reaction assay is negative for HCV RNA.\n24. Active infection requiring systemic therapy\n25. Severe infections within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment, including but not limited to hospitalization for complications of infection, bacteremia, or severe pneumonia\n26. Significant cardiovascular disease, such as cerebral vascular accident/stroke (< 6 months prior to enrollment), New York Heart Association cardiac disease (Class II or greater), myocardial infarction within the previous 6 months, unstable arrhythmias, or unstable angina\n27.
