Cohort-specific disease requirements:\n\n   1.

Phase 1a Monotherapy Backfill Additional Criterion (Part A):\n\n      - Participants must have a tumor amenable to predose, post dose and end-of- treatment tumor biopsy\n   3. Phase 1b Dose Escalation and Dose Optimization: OKI-219 + fulvestrant (Part B):\n\n      * Participants with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic HR+/HER2- breast cancer must have received at least 1 prior line of hormonal therapy in the advanced or metastatic setting and at least 1 prior CDK4/6-inhibitor unless contraindicated or unavailable in the region.\n      * Participants must be post-menopausal or agree to ovarian suppression with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist started at least 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug.\n      * Participants with HER2-low breast cancer must have received prior trastuzumab deruxtecan unless unavailable in the region or contraindicated.\n      * Candidate for fulvestrant therapy.\n   4.

ECOG PS 0 to 1.\n4. Life expectancy > 12 weeks.\n5. Have adequate archival tumor tissue (block or 10 slides) from a core or surgical biopsy, excluding bone biopsies. If no archival tissue is available, a fresh biopsy must be performed.\n6. Adequate organ and marrow function, defined as follows:\n\n   1. Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 × 10^9/L;\n   2. Platelets ≥ 100,000/μL;\n   3. Hemoglobin ≥ 8.0 g/dL;\n   4. Total bilirubin within the institutional upper limit of normal (ULN);\n   5. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 2.5 × ULN;\n   6. Creatinine clearance calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault formula ≥ 60 mL/min.\n7. All prior clinically significant treatment-related toxicities must have resolved to Grade ≤ 1 or baseline (per CTCAE version 5.0) except for alopecia. Participants with stable Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy or endocrinopathies with stable endocrine replacement therapy are eligible. Participants with irreversible toxicity that is not reasonably expected to be exacerbated by study treatment (eg, vitiligo or hearing loss) may be eligible after discussion with the Sponsor.\n8. Able to swallow and tolerate oral medications.\n9. At least 1 measurable lesion based on RECIST version 1.1.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Treatment with any investigational product or other anticancer therapy (including chemotherapy, antibody-drug conjugates, targeted agents, and immunotherapy) within 14 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter, of the first dose of study drug.\n2. Prior treatment with the PI3KαH1047R mutant-selective inhibitor LOXO-783.\n3. Participants with a known KRAS mutation.\n4. Participants with a known deleterious mutation in PTEN or negative for PTEN protein expression by IHC.\n5. Major surgery or wide-field radiation within 28 days or limited field palliative radiation within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug.\n6. Known active central nervous system metastasis.\n7. Treatment with systemic corticosteroids at a dose of > 10 mg of prednisone or equivalent at the time of enrollment.\n8. Uncontrolled Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes.\n9.

History of acute myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndromes in the 6 months prior to enrollment.\n    2. Symptomatic congestive heart failure (Grade 2 or higher), history or current evidence of clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia and/or conduction abnormality in the last 6 months except for medically managed atrial fibrillation or paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.\n    3.
