    "inclusion_criteria": "For this study, eligible adults will be those that:\n\n1. are 25 to 59 years of age at time of initial screen and identify as a parent to at least one (two max) biological child or adolescent 6-17 years;\n2. have a body mass index of between ≥23kg/m2 to <40kg/m2;\n3. have prediabetes (based on American Diabetes Association criteria of either fasting plasma glucose of ≥100 mg/dL, HgbA1c 5.7-6.4%, or 2-hour plasma glucose during 75-g oral glucose tolerance test [OGTT] 140 mg/dL to 199 mg/dL) reported within the last 6 months and confirmed by the participants medical records;\n4. have no special dietary restrictions or food allergies that would prohibit consumption of a variety of foods/beverages;\n5. are English speaking;\n6. reside within the greater Nashville, TN area;\n7. are without medical conditions that would limit participation in a diet-related study (e.g., tube feeding, dysphagia, severe food allergy causing anaphylaxis);\n8. are able to participate in a two-week dietary program that requires home preparation/cooking for all meals and snacks;\n\nFor this study, eligible offspring (child(ren)/ adolescent(s)) will be those that:\n\n1. Are 6-17 years at time of initial screen;\n2. Have an index parent with prediabetes that is actively enrolled in the program;\n3. have body mass index ≥5th percentile for age and gender on standardized CDC growth curves;\n4. have no special dietary restrictions or food allergies that would prohibit consumption of a variety of foods/beverages;\n5. have parental commitment to participate in a two-week research study;\n6. are English speaking;\n7. reside within the greater Nashville, TN area and live at home with their index parent during duration of 2- week study;\n8. are without medical conditions that would limit participation in a diet-related study (e.g., tube feeding, dysphagia, severe food allergy causing anaphylaxis);\n9. are able to participate in a two-week dietary program that includes at least dinner and snacks provided during after-school hours;\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\nAdult exclusion criteria include:\n\n1. adults outside the specified age range of <25 years or >59 years;\n2. adults whose body mass index is <23kg/m2 or those with a body mass index ≥40kg/m2 as that degree of morbid obesity represents a different phenotype where dietary behavioral intervention alone may not be sufficient to achieve weight loss);\n3. are not currently undergoing routine medical supervision by a licensed healthcare provider (i.e., MD, NP, PA) for a complicated diagnosis of prediabetes that requires routine glycemic monitoring or frequent healthcare visits for management/treatment;\n4. adults actively participating in any type of weight loss program (dietary or physical activity) or those who participate in regular (≥120 minutes per week) moderate to vigorous physical activity (as requirements of the program include assessing weight change as a result of the diet);\n5. adults with a prior history of type 2 diabetes;\n6. adults who are not English speaking;\n7. adults with special dietary restrictions, food allergies, or medical conditions that prohibit participation in a diet-related study;\n8. adults with serious mental or neurologic illness that impairs ability to consent/participate;\n9. women who are pregnant or nursing due to increased metabolic state requiring greater energy requirements;\n10. adults currently taking medications to treat diabetes or to promote weight loss;\n11. adults living outside the greater Nashville, TN area;\n12. adults with poor visual acuity (corrected vision worse than 20/50 with Rosenbaum Screener);\n13. adults who do not otherwise meet the eligibility criteria listed in sections above as determined by pre-screen;\n\nOffspring (child[ren] and adolescent[s]) exclusion criteria include:\n\n1. children/adolescents outside the specified age range of <6 years or >17 years;\n2. children/adolescents whose body mass index is <5th percentile for age and gender on standardized CDC growth curves;\n3. children/adolescents who do not have an eligible index parent participating in the study;\n4. children who do not have parental commitment to participate consistently for two-weeks;\n5. children/adolescents with a current or past diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (including prediabetes and type-2);\n6. children/adolescents who are not English speaking;\n7. children/adolescents with special dietary restrictions, food allergies, or medical conditions that prohibit participation in a diet-related study;\n8. children/adolescents who display dissenting behaviors during baseline data collection;\n9. children/adolescents actively participating in any type of weight loss program (medical or lifestyle);\n10. children/adolescents who do not otherwise meet the eligibility criteria listed in sections above as determined by pre-screen;\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 25 Years\nMust have maximum age of 59 Years",
