    "official_title": "A Phase 3, Randomized, Open-Label Study to Evaluate Safety and Efficacy of Epcoritamab in Combination With R-CHOP Compared to R-CHOP in Subjects With Newly Diagnosed Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL)",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Planned to receive treatment with 6 cycles of standard rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) per investigator determination.\n* Must have newly diagnosed, histologically confirmed CD20+ diffuse large b-cell lymphoma [DLBCL] (de novo or histologically transformed from a diagnosis of follicular lymphoma) at most recent representative tumor biopsy based on the pathology report, with a World Health Organization (WHO) 2016 classification and including:\n\n  * DLBCL, Not Otherwise Specified (NOS).\n  * High grade B-cell lymphoma with MYC and BCL-2 and/or BCL-6 rearrangement with DLBCL morphology.\n  * T-cell/histiocyte-rich large B-cell lymphoma.\n  * Epstein Barr virus-positive DLBCL, NOS.\n  * Follicular lymphoma Grade 3b.\n\nNote: The local pathology report must be available at Screening to support CD20+ DLBCL histology.\n\nComposite/intermediate histology with any of the following components is not allowed: high grade B-cell lymphoma, NOS; Hodgkin's lymphoma; primary mediastinal (thymic) large B-cell lymphoma; Burkitt; plasmablastic lymphoma or any CD20- lymphoma, such as anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive large B-cell lymphoma, human herpesvirus type 8-positive DLBCL, or primary effusion lymphoma.\n\n* Availability of archival or fresh or paraffin embedded tissue at Screening.\n* Must have an IPI score of 2-5. The number of participants with IPI 2 will not exceed approximately 30% of the overall sample size.\n* Must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0-2 prior to initiating R-CHOP treatment. Note that participant with an initial ECOG performance status >= 3 may be screened if pre-phase treatment is planned. Participant may be eligible if ECOG performance status were to improve to 0-2 during pre-phase treatment.\n* Has at least one target lesion defined as:\n\n  * >= 1 measurable nodal lesion (long axis > 1.5 cm ) or >= 1 measurable extra-nodal lesion (long axis > 1 cm) on computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). AND\n  * Positron emission tomography (PET)-positive on PET-CT scan.\n* Laboratory values meeting the criteria laid out in the protocol.\n* Left ventricular ejection fraction must be >= 50% by multi-gated acquisition or transthoracic echocardiography at Screening.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 79 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* History of prior systemic anti-lymphoma therapy for diagnosed diffuse large b-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) including any definitive radiotherapy with curative intent] other than corticosteroids with or without vincristine during prephase treatment, or non-curative intent palliative radiotherapy with the stipulation that radiated lesions cannot be selected as target lesion for response assessment.\n* Clinically significant cardiovascular disease as per the protocol.",
