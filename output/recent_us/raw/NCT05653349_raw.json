If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required. Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and preferred contraception for the subject.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Prior Fulvestrant for metastatic breast cancer will be allowed for phase 1 portion but not for the phase 2 portion\n* History of hypersensitivity to any of the excipients in the Debio 1347 formulation (lactose hydrate, microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, hydroxypropyl cellulose, sodium lauryl sulfate, and magnesium stearate).\n* Other malignancies requiring active treatment in the last 6 months.\n* Brain tumors and/or brain metastases unless they are asymptomatic, stable on recent imaging (not dated more than 30 days from the inclusion date), and have not required active treatment in the last 6 months.\n* History and/or current evidence of endocrine alteration of calcium-phosphate homeostasis.\n* History of myocardial infarction or stroke within 6 months, congestive heart failure greater than NYHA class II, unstable angina pectoris, unexplained recurrent syncope, cardiac arrhythmia requiring treatment or family history of sudden death from cardiacrelated causes.\n* Baseline Frederica\"s corrected QT (QTcF) interval greater than 470 msec (female) or greater than 450 msec (male), history of congenital long QT syndrome, the presence in the screening ECG of a conduction abnormality that in the opinion of the Investigator would preclude safe participation in this study.\n* Concomitant use of a drug with a known risk of QTc prolongation\n* Current anticoagulation therapy with therapeutic doses of warfarin (low-dose warfarin ≤ 1mg/day or low molecular-weight heparin are permitted).\n* History and or current evidence of ectopic mineralisation/calcification including but not limited to the soft tissue, kidneys, intestine, myocardium and lung with the exception of calcified lymph nodes and asymptomatic coronary calcification.\n* Concomitant use of high dose systemic steroids and other drugs such as calcitonin preparations, active Vitamin D3 preparations, estrogen preparations, selective estrogen receptor modulators, Vitamin K2 preparations, parathyroid hormones, phosphorus absorbers. Note, inhaled, topical steroids and low tapering doses of steroid especially in patients treated recently for brain metastases will be included.\n* Corneal disease, such as bullous or band keratopathy, corneal desquamation, keratitis, corneal ulcer, or keratoconjunctivitis.\n* Known infection requiring the systemic use of, for example, an antibiotic or antiviral agent.\n* Known HIV, HBV or HCV infection.\n* Known untreated or uncontrolled acute infection, including urinary tract infection, within 7 days of study entry.\n* History of organ, bone marrow, or stem cell transplantation.\n* Pregnant or lactating woman (any woman of childbearing potential who has menstruated within the year prior to enrolment will undergo pregnancy testing within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication).\n* Women of childbearing potential or men who are unwilling to use an appropriate method of contraception during the study period and for 6 months after completing treatment with Debio 1347. Oral or injectable contraceptive agents cannot be the sole method of contraception.

In case of monoclonal antibodies/biologics, within 28 days prior to starting study treatment.\n* Administration of investigational agents within 28 days prior to treatment initiation.\n* Major surgery and surgery for brain metastases within 28 days prior to screening start. Of note, Intravenous port placement is not considered as a major surgery.\n* Not recovered from AEs or toxicities due to previous treatments to a Grade 1 or less specified in NCI-CTCAE version 4.0 excepting, albumin (< 2.5 g/dL), AST and ALT in patients with liver metastases (> 5 × ULN) ALP in patients with bone metastases (> 5 × ULN) and alopecia.\n* Prior use of a drug targeting FGF or FGFR. Patients previously treated with medications that affect FGFR signaling as a secondary target (e.g., multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitors that primarily inhibit VEGF, but to a lesser extent also affect FGFR signaling) can be considered after discussion with the Principal Investigator.\n* Currently under alcohol or drug abuse rehabilitation or treatment program.\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n\nEligibility Note: Patients could have progressed on prior aromatase inhibitors",
