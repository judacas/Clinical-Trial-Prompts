Participants must have progressive disease after at least 1 prior line of a CDK4/6 inhibitor and at least 1 prior line of endocrine therapy.\n\n* Participants must have not received more than 3 lines of systemic therapies including up to 1 line of cytotoxic chemotherapy for visceral disease in advanced or metastatic setting; Participants may have but are not required to have prior treatment with fulvestrant.\n* Participants with ER+HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer must have documentation of ER-positive tumor (≥1% positive stained cells) based on most recent tumor biopsy utilizing an assay consistent with local standards.\n* Participants with ER+HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer must have documentation of HER2-negative tumor: HER2-negative tumor is determined as immunohistochemistry score 0/1+ or negative by in situ hybridization (FISH/CISH/SISH/DISH) defined as a HER2/CEP17 ratio <2 or for single probe assessment a HER2 copy number <4.\n* Female participants with ER+HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer considered to be of childbearing potential (or have tubal ligations only) must be willing to undergo medically induced menopause by treatment with the approved LHRH agonist such as goserelin, leuprolide or equivalent agents to induce chemical menopause.\n* Female participants with ER+HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer of nonchildbearing potential must meet at least 1 criteria of achieving postmenopausal status.\n* Participants must have at least 1 measurable lesion as defined by RECIST version 1.1 that has not been previously irradiated.\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status PS 0 or 1\n* Female or male patients aged ≥ 18 years (Japan ≥ 20 years) (South Korea ≥ 19 years).\n* Adequate renal, liver, and bone marrow function.\n* Resolved acute effects of any prior therapy to baseline severity or CTCAE Grade 1 except for adverse events (AEs) not constituting a safety risk by investigator judgment.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Unmanageable ascites (limited medical treatment to control ascites is permitted, but all participants with ascites require review by sponsor's medical monitor).\n* Participants with any other active malignancy within 3 years prior to enrollment, except for adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, or carcinoma in situ.\n* Major surgery, radiation therapy, or systemic anti-cancer therapy within 3 weeks prior to study entry.\n* Prior irradiation to >25% of the bone marrow.\n* ECG clinically relevant abnormalities (eg, QTc >470 msec, complete LBBB, second/third degree AV block, ST elevation or EKG changes suggesting myocardial infarction or active myocardia ischemia).\n* Therapeutic anticoagulation. However, low molecular weight heparin is allowed. Vitamin K antagonists or factor Xa inhibitors may be allowed following discussion with the Sponsor.\n* Known or suspected hypersensitivity or severe allergy to active ingredient/excipients of PF-07248144.\n* Active inflammatory GI disease, refractory and unresolved chronic diarrhea or previous gastric resection, lap band surgery or other GI conditions and surgeries that may significantly alter the absorption of PF-07248144 tablets.
