Hepatitis B or C serologic status: subjects who are hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) positive and who are surface antigen negative will need to have a negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Those who are hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg) positive or hepatitis B PCR positive will be excluded. Subjects who are hepatitis C antibody positive will need to have a negative PCR result. Those who are hepatitis C PCR positive will be excluded. Subjects with a history of Hepatitis C who received antiviral treatment are eligible as long as PCR is negative\n* Concurrent systemic immunosuppressant therapy (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, etc., or chronic administration glucocorticoid equivalent of > 10 mg/day of prednisone) within 28 days of the first dose of study drug\n* Known anaphylaxis or immunoglobulin (Ig) E-mediated hypersensitivity to murine proteins or to any component of acalabrutinib, lenalidomide and/or rituximab\n* Requires anticoagulation with warfarin or equivalent vitamin K antagonists (e.g., phenprocoumon).
