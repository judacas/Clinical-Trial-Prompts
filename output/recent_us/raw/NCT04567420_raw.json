Placement of vascular access device, percutaneous tumor biopsy, or bone marrows are not considered major surgical procedures and no minimum time frame prior to starting study drug therapy is required.\n* Patients who have any known severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions or other conditions that could affect their participation in the study such as:\n* Severely impaired lung function defined as spirometry and DLCO that is 50% of the normal predicted value corrected for hemoglobin and alveolar volume and/or O2 saturation that is 88% or less at rest on room air.
