    "official_title": "A Clinical Trial Evaluating the Efficacy of Combining Laser Interstitial Thermal Ablation With and Without Spine Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Patients With Spine Metastases",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Age > 18 years old. (The indication for this technique is controversial in skeletally immature patients.)\n* Histologic diagnosis of solid malignant tumor (not one of the more radiosensitive histologic subtypes, see Exclusion Criteria), including but not limited to non-small cell lung cancer, breast, prostate, renal cell, melanoma, gastrointestinal, sarcoma, thyroid, head and neck primary, and unknown primary tumors.\n* Quantification of the degree of epidural spinal cord compression as grade 1C, 2, or 3 by MRI, with and without contrast sequences. Axial T2 sequence is encouraged but not required.\n* The vertebral body site to be treated must be located from T2 to L1\n* No more than 3 contiguous or dis-contiguous vertebral levels involved with metastasis in the spine to be irradiated in a single session or 3 sessions.\n* Motor strength â‰¥4 out of 5 in extremity or extremities affected by the level of the spinal cord compression (see section 4 for grading method).\n* ECOG performance status <2 or Karnofsky performance status (KPS) >50\n* Life expectancy >3 months.\n* Inoperable disease because of patient refusal, neurosurgical evaluation, or any other medical reasons.\n* Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) before study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.\n* Prior conventional radiation to the same site is allowed as long as there is a greater than 3 months interval.\n* Signed informed consent.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Requires open spinal procedure or a percutaneous procedure without the use of image guidance.\n* Primary tumors of radiosensitive histology (lymphoma, multiple myeloma, small cell carcinoma, germ cell tumors), as conventional radiation is likely to be effective in such cases.\n* Unable to tolerate general anesthesia and prone position.\n* Unable to undergo MRI scan of the spine.\n* Inability to lie flat on a treatment table for >60 minutes.\n* Pregnant. (Urine testing must be done no more than 10 days prior to surgery.)\n* Prior conventional irradiation of the spine site and level to be treated with an interval shorter than 3 months.\n* Frank cord compression or cord compression from bone components or configuration and acute neurological deficits (defined as motor strength <4/5 in extremity or extremities affected by the level of the spinal cord compression)",
