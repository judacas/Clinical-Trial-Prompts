Has active pancreatitis secondary to pancreatic duct obstruction\n13. Has active gall bladder disease\n14. Is pregnant, lactating or is planning to attempt to become pregnant during this study or within 4 months after the last dose of study drug (women) or is planning to attempt to impregnate someone or donate sperm during the study or within 14 weeks after the last dose of study drug (men).\n15.
