Severe and/or uncontrolled concurrent medical disease that in the opinion of the investigator could cause unacceptable safety risks or compromise compliance with the protocol (e.g. uncontrolled diabetes, active or uncontrolled infection, pulmonary hypertension)\n5. History of acute pancreatitis within 1 year of study entry or past medical history of chronic pancreatitis\n6. Known presence of significant congenital or acquired bleeding disorder unrelated to cancer\n7. History of other active malignancy within 3 years prior to study entry with the exception of previous or concomitant basal cell skin cancer and previous carcinoma in situ treated curatively\n8. Impairment of gastrointestinal (GI) function or GI disease that may significantly alter the absorption of study drug (e.g. ulcerative disease, uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome, small bowel resection, or gastric bypass surgery)\n9. Previous treatment with or known/ suspected hypersensitivity to asciminib or any of its excipients.\n10. Participation in a prior investigational study within 30 days prior to randomization or within 5 half-lives of the investigational product, whichever is longer\n11. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women\n12. Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception.\n\n    Highly effective contraception methods include:\n    * Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception\n    * Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) total hysterectomy or bilateral tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment). In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment\n    * Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). The vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that subject.\n    * Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS) or other forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate <1%), for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception.\n    * In case of use of oral contraception women should have been stable on the same pill for a minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment.\n    * Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy), total hysterectomy or bilateral tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study medication. In the case of oophorectomy alone, women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment.\n13. Sexually active males unwilling to use a condom during intercourse while taking study treatment and for 3 days after stopping study (only for patients treated with asciminib). A condom is required for all sexually active male participants on asciminib treatment to prevent them from fathering a child AND to prevent delivery of study treatment via seminal fluid to their partner. In addition, these male participants must not donate sperm for the time period specified above.\n14. If a patient is presenting with symptoms suggestive of possible COVID-19 infection, we advise ruling it out by appropriate testing recommended by health authorities.\n\n    * Nucleic acid amplification tests for viral RNA (polymerase chain reaction), in order to measure current infection with SARS-CoV-2\n    * Antigen tests for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2\n    * Antibody (serology) tests to detect the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2",
    "miscellaneous_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria\n\nParticipants eligible for inclusion in this study must meet all of the following criteria:\n\n1.

Patients with mild to moderate renal and hepatic impairment are eligible if:\n\n   * Total bilirubin ≤ 3.0 x ULN without AST/ALT increase\n   * Aspartate transaminase (AST) ≤ 5.0 x ULN\n   * Alanine transaminase (ALT) ≤ 5.0 x ULN\n   * Serum lipase ≤ 1.5 x ULN.

Patients must avoid consumption of grapefruit, Seville oranges or products containing the juice of each during the entire study and preferably 7 days before the first dose of study medications, due to potential CYP3A4 interaction with the study medications.
