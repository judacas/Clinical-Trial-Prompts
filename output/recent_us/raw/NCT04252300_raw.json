Patients with clinically significant pelvic or para-aortic nodal disease, on post-surgery CT scan, that was not dissected and would require higher boost dose\n3. Patients with recurrent endometrial cancer with gross nodal or vaginal disease requiring high dose radiotherapy, or history of prior chemotherapy\n4. Patients with a history of prior pelvic/abdominal RT or with history of prior cancer treatment that contraindicates this protocol therapy including history of prior chemotherapy for any other malignancy.\n5. Patients with a history of serious co-morbid illness or uncontrolled illnesses that would preclude protocol therapy\n6. Patients with an estimated survival of less than three months\n7.
