    "inclusion_criteria": "* Subjects must be able to understand the nature of this trial and provide written informed consent, prior to any study specific procedures. Patients with impaired decision making capacity (IDMC) who have a close caregiver or legally authorized representative (LAR) may be considered eligible for this study at the treating physician's discretion, provided that the physician is reasonably sure that the possible risks and benefits of the study are clear and that the patient will take the drug as prescribed\n* Subjects must be diagnosed with a solid malignant tumor (other than cholangiocarcinoma or primary central nervous system [CNS] tumor) that has progressed despite standard therapy, or for which no effective standard therapy exists. Patients with cholangiocarcinoma are no longer allowed as this cohort has closed to accrual. Patients with primary CNS tumors, e.g. glioma, are not allowed\n* Patients must have biopsy-confirmed evidence of an IDH1 or IDH2 mutation, confirmed in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA)-certified laboratory, associated with neomorphic activity of the encoded proteins\n* Patients must have tumors determined to be easily accessible for biopsy and must be willing to have serial biopsies. Tumor biopsies will be performed on the most accessible biopsiable site of disease. All possible precautions to avoid complications will be taken, including discussions in multidisciplinary meetings, if needed. If a patient opts out of a pre-treatment biopsy, biopsy is not possible, or if a pre-treatment biopsy does not yield sufficient tissue for analysis, the patient must be willing to provide a sufficient archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimen for liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) analysis of 2HG in order to enroll on the study. Permission of the study principal investigator (PI) is required in all of the above scenarios\n\n  * In order to maximize the availability of newly obtained specimens for 2-HG analysis, at least 10 biopsies will be required in each group (cholangiocarcinoma and other solid tumors) of 14 patients treated in the first stage of this Simon two-stage design. Thus if 4 patients in an arm have already opted out, further patients may only enroll on that arm (in the first stage) if they agree to undergo the pre- and on-treatment biopsies. If a patient has agreed to undergo the two biopsies and undergoes the pre-treatment biopsy, he or she may not opt out of the second biopsy unless such a biopsy would not be safe (e.g. inaccessible tumor). Permission of the study PI is required in this scenario\n  * All patients must be willing to provide 5 unstained archival slides, if available, for pre-treatment 2-HG analysis and correlation with 2-HG levels in pre-treatment frozen specimens\n* Patients must be willing to undergo extra blood sampling for correlative studies\n* Patients must have measurable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v)1.1\n* Patients must have at least one lesion, not previously irradiated, that can be accurately measured at baseline as >= 10 mm in the longest diameter (except lymph nodes which must have short axis >= 15 mm) with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or >= 10 mm with callipers by clinical exam OR at least one lesion (measurable) that can be accurately assessed by CT/MRI/clinical exam at baseline and follow up visits\n* Subjects must have progressive cancer at the time of study entry\n* Prior experimental (non-Food and Drug Administration [FDA] approved) therapies (other than drugs that target ATR) and immunotherapies are allowed. Patients must not have received these therapies for 30 days or five half-lives of the drug (whichever is less) prior to the initiation of study treatment\n* Toxicities from prior therapies should have recovered to =< grade 1, with the exception of stable chronic grade 2 toxicities that are not overlapping with presumed toxicities of olaparib\n* Patients with treated brain metastases are eligible if there is no evidence of progression for at least 4 weeks after central nervous system (CNS)-directed treatment, as ascertained by clinical examination and brain imaging (MRI or CT scan) during the screening period\n* Patients with new or progressive brain metastases (active brain metastases) or leptomeningeal disease are eligible if the treating physician determines that immediate CNS specific treatment is not required and is unlikely to be required for at least 4 weeks (or scheduled assessment after the first cycle of treatment), and a risk-benefit analysis (discussion) by the patient and the investigator favors participation in the clinical trial\n* If evidence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, HBV viral load must be undetectable on suppressive therapy if indicated. If history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, must be treated with undetectable HCV viral load\n* Female/male of age >= 18 years.

Patients with a history of localized triple negative breast cancer may be eligible, provided they completed their adjuvant chemotherapy more than three years prior to registration, and that the patient remains free of recurrent or metastatic disease\n* Resting electrocardiography (ECG) indicating uncontrolled, potentially reversible cardiac conditions, as judged by the investigator (e.g., unstable ischemia, uncontrolled symptomatic arrhythmia, congestive heart failure, Fridericia's corrected QT [QTcF] prolongation > 500 ms, electrolyte disturbances, etc.), or patients with congenital long QT syndrome\n* Concomitant use of known strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g. itraconazole, telithromycin, clarithromycin, protease inhibitors boosted with ritonavir or cobicistat, indinavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, boceprevir, telaprevir) or moderate CYP3A inhibitors (e.g. ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, diltiazem, fluconazole, verapamil). The required washout period prior to starting study treatment is 2 weeks\n* Concomitant use of known strong (e.g. phenobarbital, enzalutamide, phenytoin, rifampicin, rifabutin, rifapentine, carbamazepine, nevirapine and St John's Wort) or moderate CYP3A inducers (e.g. bosentan, efavirenz, modafinil). The required washout period prior to starting study treatment is 5 weeks for enzalutamide or phenobarbital and 3 weeks for other agents\n* Persistent toxicities caused by previous cancer therapy. Toxicities should have recovered to =< grade 1, excluding alopecia, or should be stable chronic grade 2 toxicities that do not overlap with presumed toxicities of olaparib and/or AZD6738\n* Patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or features suggestive of MDS/AML\n* Patients with new or progressive brain metastases (active brain metastases) or leptomeningeal disease are not eligible if the treating physician determines that immediate CNS specific treatment is required, and a risk-benefit analysis (discussion) by the patient and the investigator does not favor participation in the clinical trial. A scan to confirm the absence of brain metastases is not required. The patient can receive a stable dose of corticosteroids before and during the study if these were started at least 4 weeks prior to treatment. Patients with spinal cord compression unless considered to have received definitive treatment for this and evidence of clinically stable disease for 28 days\n* Major surgery within 2 weeks of starting study treatment.
