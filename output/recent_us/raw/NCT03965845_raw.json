    "official_title": "A Pilot Study of 18Fluorine-Fluciclovine Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography for Staging Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer Preceding Radical Cystectomy",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Participants must have histologically or cytologically confirmed urothelial carcinoma of the bladder.\n* Participants must have cT2-T4N0 disease at the time of the study, as defined by conventional CT or MRI imaging. Patients must have no definite evidence of locoregional or distant metastatic disease at the time of study eligibility, as defined by conventional imaging.\n* Radical cystectomy must be planned for the patient after the planned 18F-fluciclovine-PET/CT.\n* Patients may or may not have had prior neoadjuvant therapy prior to this study.\n* Age ≥18 years. Since no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of 18F-fluciclovine in participants <18 years of age, and the majority of bladder cancer occur in the adult population [42], children are excluded from this study but will be eligible for future pediatric trials.\n* ECOG performance status ≤2 (Karnofsky ≥60%, see Appendix A)\n* Ability and willingness to comply with the study procedures.\n* The effects of 18F-fluciclovine on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because radiopharmaceuticals may be teratogenic, women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for 24 hours after the PET/CT scan is completed. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Participants with other known malignancies that has required treatment in the past 3 years.\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because 18F-fluciclovine is a radiopharmaceutical with the potential for teratogenic effects. Because of the radiation exposure to a nursing infant from 18F-fluciclovine, women who are breastfeeding are also excluded from this study.\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to 18F-fluciclovine.\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* Contraindications for PET/CT including:\n\n  * Severe claustrophobia\n* Any past or current condition that in the opinion of the study investigators would confound the results of the study or pose additional risk to the patient by their participation in the study",
