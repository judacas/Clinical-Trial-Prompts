Concurrent therapy with bisphosphonates or denosumab for bone metastases is allowed, provided they are started prior to study entry. Palliative radiation to non-target lesions is also allowed as screened by the Principal Investigator.\n* Presence of any other concurrent malignancy requiring active therapy or thought to potentially interfere with the safe conduct or assessment of outcomes on this trial.\n* History of allergy or intolerance to lenvatinib or study drug components (or any of their excipients) or severe (> Grade 3) hypersensitivity reaction to pembrolizumab and/or any of its excipients or any monoclonal antibody.\n* Prior use of lenvatinib or pazopanib or any PD-1/PD-L1 or anti-PD-L2 targeted therapies or with an agent directed at another stimulatory or co-inhibitory T-cell receptor (CTLA-4, OX-40, CD137).\n* Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic pressure >140mm Hg or diastolic pressure >90mm Hg, despite optimal medical management.\n* Prior systemic anti-cancer therapy including use of another investigation drug or device (i.e., outside study treatment) during, or within 3 weeks of trial entry (time of initiation of experimental drug).\n* Prior radiotherapy within 2 weeks of the start of study treatment.

Testing for HIV, HCV, or HBV prior to initiation of the study drug is not required. If patient's have a known history of treated HCV, then a viral load is required to confirm clearance of infection.\n* Serious non-healing wound, ulcer or bone fracture, that is not tumor related.\n* History of organ allograft (including corneal transplant).\n* Has a history or current evidence of any medical or other condition, therapy or laboratory abnormality which, in the opinion of the investigator, might confound the results of the study, or preclude participation in a clinical study.\n* Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of study treatment. The use of physiologic doses of corticosteroids (up to 10 mg/d of prednisone or equivalent) may be approved after consultation with the Primary Investigator.\n* Active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e., with the use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs), with the exception of autoimmune thyroid disease, vitiligo, type 1 diabetes mellitus, or psoriasis. Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment.\n* Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or current pneumonitis.\n* Renal failure requiring active hemo- or peritoneal dialysis.\n* Has received a live-virus vaccination within 30 days of planned treatment start.
