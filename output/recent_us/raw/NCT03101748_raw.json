Tumor must harbor an activating mutation in the PIK3CA gene with or without PTEN loss, either previously documented or determined during screening.\n5. Fresh or archival tumor biopsy with sufficient material to be sent to the designated laboratory for PD analyses. For subjects who consent to future research, an additional 5 slides from a surgical specimen or biopsy is required.\n6. Cohort 1a - Dose Modification (subjects with any solid tumor): failed, were intolerant of, or ineligible for no more than three prior lines of therapy (LOT) for advanced/metastatic disease or refused SOC therapy.\n7. For all cohorts, in the unlikely scenario that a subject refused all available SOC they may proceed with trial. These subjects would be regarded as having 0 prior LOT.\n8. Cohorts 1b, 2, 3, and 4 - failed, were intolerant of, ineligible for, or have refused SOC therapy for advanced/metastatic disease (AJCC stage III and IV) and:\n\n   1. Cohort 2 (subjects with colorectal cancer): Have failed no more than two prior LOT for metastatic CRC.\n   2. Cohort 1b, and Cohort 3 (subjects with EC): Have no more than three prior chemotherapeutic regimens for management of endometrial carcinoma (neo-adjuvant and/or adjuvant chemotherapy will be counted as one prior LOT). Prior hormonal therapy will not count as a systemic regimen.\n   3. Cohort 1b, and Cohort 4 (subjects with clear cell or endometrioid OC): Subjects must have had no more than three prior chemotherapeutic regimens for management of ovarian carcinoma. Prior hormonal therapy will not count as a systemic regimen.\n9. Life expectancy of at least 3 months.\n10. At least one measurable lesion (as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] 1.1).\n11. ECOG PS of 0 to 1.\n12. Adequate organ function\n\n    1. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1.0 × 10^9/L or ≥1.5 x 10^9/L if planned to be treated with nab-paclitaxel, platelet count ≥75 × 10^9/L, and hemoglobin ≥8.5 gm/dL (may be transfused to reach this hemoglobin level unless due to blood loss).\n    2. Liver transaminases (AST and ALT) ≤2.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) (<5 × ULN if liver metastases are present), and total bilirubin ≤1.5 × ULN (<3 x ULN if subject has Gilbert Syndrome).\n    3. INR ≤1.5 x ULN unless subject is on anticoagulants that would affect the INR, then INR must be in the desired therapeutic range as judged by the Investigator.\n    4. Albumin level ≥3.0 mg/dL or ≥ the lower limit of normal.\n    5. Renal: Serum creatinine ≤2 x ULN\n13. Ability to take PO medication, be willing to adhere to study procedures and Study Intervention administration, and receive, consume, and comply with Study ISD.\n14. For women of child-bearing potential, a negative serum pregnancy test collected at screening (Visit-1) and negative urine pregnancy test collected at baseline (Visit-1) and use of physician-approved method of birth control from the time of the pregnancy test performed at screening to 90 days following the last administration of Study Drug or, if applicable, 6 months following the last administration of nab-paclitaxel.\n15. Male subjects must be surgically sterile or must agree to use physician-approved contraception during the study and for 90 days following the last administration of Study Drug.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
