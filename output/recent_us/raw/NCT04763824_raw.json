    "inclusion_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria\n\n* Subject has provided informed consent prior to initiation of any study specific activities or procedures.\n* Male or female subjects age ≥ 18 years\n* First or second relapse of multiple myeloma by IMWG criteria (subjects refractory to the most recent line of therapy, excluding carfilzomib, are eligible)\n* Refractory to lenalidamide\n* Measurable disease with at least 1 of the following assessed within 28 days prior to enrollment:\n\n  * IgG multiple myeloma: serum monoclonal protein (M-protein) level ≥ 1.0 g/dL\n  * IgA, IgD, IgE multiple myeloma: serum M-protein level ≥ 0.5 g/dL\n  * urine M-protein ≥ 200 mg per 24 hours\n  * in subjects without measurable serum or urine M-protein, serum-free light chain (SFLC) ≥ 100 mg/L (involved light chain) and an abnormal serum kappa lambda ratio\n* Must have at least a PR to at least 1 line of prior therapy\n* Prior therapy with proteasome inhibitors is allowed. Subjects receiving prior carfilzomib therapy must have achieved at least a PR, was not removed due to toxicity, did not relapse within 60 days from discontinuation of carfilzomib, and must have at least a 6 month carfilzomib treatment-free interval from their last dose of carfilzomib\n* ECOG PS of 0 to 2\n\nExclusion Criteria\n\n* Primary refractory multiple myeloma\n* Waldenström macroglobulinemia\n* Multiple myeloma of IgM subtype\n* POEMS syndrome (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal protein, and skin changes)\n* Plasma cell leukemia ( greater than 2.0 × 109/L circulating plasma cells by differential). If automated differential shows ≥ 20% of other cells, obtain manual differential to identify other cells.\n* Primary amyloidosis (patients with multiple myeloma with asymptomatic deposition of amyloid plaques found on biopsy would be eligible if all other criteria are met)\n* Previous diagnosis of amyloidosis associated with myeloma\n* Myelodysplastic syndrome\n* Toxicity requiring discontinuation of lenalidomide therapy\n* Prior treatment with pomalidomide\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 99 Years",
