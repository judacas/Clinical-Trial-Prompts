    "exclusion_criteria": "* Patients who have had previous systemic anti-cancer therapy within 3 weeks of registration or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered previously\n\n  * Note: Patients are considered enrolled on the study after protocol registration and not after signing consent\n* Patients who are receiving any other concurrent investigational agents\n* Patient is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment; the use of physiologic doses of corticosteroids (e.g. prednisone =< 20 mg/d) may be approved after consultation with the study PI; topical or inhaled corticosteroids are allowed\n* Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment; exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy, or in situ cervical cancer\n* Patients with active cerebral or meningeal involvement by lymphoma should be excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) or KW-0761 (mogamulizumab)\n* Subject with active autoimmune disease; subjects with vitiligo, eczema, alopecia, type I diabetes mellitus, psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, or endocrine deficiencies (such as hypothyroidism) managed with replacement hormones, including physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy are eligible\n* Has a history or currently active (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids unless prior history of chemotherapy or radiotherapy induced pneumonitis meeting the eligibility criteria\n* Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the patient's participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of the patient to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator\n* Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, or anti-CTLA-4 antibody (including ipilimumab or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation or checkpoint pathways)\n* Prior allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT)\n* Patients who are planning to receive allogeneic SCT in the near future as preliminary reports suggest added toxicity in patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation after having received mogamulizumab\n* Autologous SCT =< 90 days prior to first dose of study drug\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, interstitial lung disease or active, non-infectious pneumonitis, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) is an agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with MK-3475 (pembrolizumab), breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with MK-3475 (pembrolizumab); these potential risks may also apply to KW-0761 (mogamulizumab)\n* MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) and KW-0761 (mogamulizumab) may have adverse effects on a fetus in utero; furthermore, it is not known if MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) or KW-0761 (mogamulizumab) has transient adverse effects on the composition of sperm; patients are excluded from this study if pregnant or breastfeeding or expecting to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the trial, starting with the screening visit through 180 days after the last dose of trial treatment\n* Patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are excluded if they have a detectable viral load, are not on a stable antiretroviral regimen, have a decreased CD4+ T-cell count (< 500), or require prophylactic antibiotics for the prevention of opportunistic infections\n* Has a known history of hepatitis B (defined as hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] reactive) or known active hepatitis C virus (defined as HCV ribonucleic acid [RNA] [qualitative] is detected) infection\n\n  * Note: No testing for hepatitis B and hepatitis C is required unless mandated by local health authority\n* Has a known history of active tuberculosis (TB)\n* Patients with significant cardiac disease (e.g., New York Heart Association [NYHA] class III-IV congestive heart failure, unstable angina, recent myocardial infarction within the last 6 months, etc.)",
