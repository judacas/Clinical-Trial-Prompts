Willing and able to comply with all aspects of the protocol.\n\n  3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 or 1.\n\n  4. Life expectancy ≥ 3 months.\n\n  5. Subjects with histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced solid tumors that are metastatic or unresectable, or relapsed or refractory (r/r) lymphoma, and for whom standard life-prolonging measures are not available. Types of lymphoma may include, but are not limited to, natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma, classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL), and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).\n\n  6. No standard therapy available or standard therapy is considered unsuitable or intolerable according to the Investigator.\n\n  7. Patients with or without measurable disease are considered eligible. Patients who have measurable disease as assessed by the local site investigator and/or radiologist. Lesions situated in a previously irradiated area are considered measurable if progression has been demonstrated in such lesions.\n\n  8. Have provided archival tumor tissue sample or newly obtained core or excisional biopsy of a tumor lesion not previously irradiated. If previously treated with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy, tumor tissue sample obtained following the most recent anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy is required. Formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks are preferred to slides. Newly obtained biopsies are preferred to archived tissue. For patients with specific types of lymphomas, bone marrow biopsy will be required as appropriate.\n\n  9. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) greater than 50% on echocardiography or multiple gated acquisition (MUGA) scan.\n\n  10. Patient has organ function as shown by the following:\n  1. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1.5 x 109/L.\n  2. Hemoglobin ≥8 g/dL (which may be reached by transfusion).\n  3. Platelets ≥100 x 109/L (which may be reached by transfusion).\n  4. International normalized ratio (INR) ≤1.5.\n  5.

Total serum bilirubin ≤ ULN or ≤1.5 x ULN if liver metastases are present; or total bilirubin ≤3.0 x ULN with direct bilirubin below or within normal range in patients with well documented Gilbert's Syndrome. Gilbert's syndrome is defined as presence of episodes of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia with normal results from cells blood count (including normal reticulocyte count and blood smear), normal liver function test results, and absence of other contributing disease processes at the time of diagnosis.\n  7. Creatinine clearance (CrCL) >60 mL/min calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault Equation.\n\n     11.

In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow-up hormone level assessment, is she considered not of child-bearing potential.\n  2. Woman of childbearing potential who agrees to follow contraceptive guidance during the treatment period and for at least 90 days after the last dose of study treatment.\n\nHighly effective contraception is defined as either:\n\n* Total abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. (Periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.)\n* Female sterilization: When the female study patient has had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow-up hormone level assessment.\n* Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate). For female study patients, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient.\n* Using a combination of any two of the following:\n\n  * Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS), and\n  * Barrier methods of contraception: condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository.\n  * Hormonal contraception methods (e.g., oral, injected, implanted).\n\n    12.
