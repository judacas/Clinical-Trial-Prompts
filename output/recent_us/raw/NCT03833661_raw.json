A minimum of 2 weeks must have elapsed between the end of whole-brain radiation therapy and study treatment\n* Patients with new or progressive brain metastases (active brain metastases) or leptomeningeal disease are eligible if the treating physician determines that immediate central nervous system (CNS) specific treatment is not required and is unlikely to be required for at least 4 weeks (or scheduled assessment after the first cycle of treatment), and a risk-benefit analysis (discussion) by the patient and the investigator favors participation in the clinical trial\n* Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen are eligible for this trial\n* HER2 antibody conjugated to a topoisomerase 1 inhibitor agents as well as AZD6738 are known to be teratogenic; thus, women of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for at least 7 months (women of childbearing potential [WOCBP] only) after the last dose of study drug. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 6 months after completion of study drug administration\n* Women of non-child-bearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea (in questionable cases, a blood sample with simultaneous follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH] > 40 mIU/mL and estradiol < 40 pg/mL [< 147 pmol/L] is confirmatory) are eligible.

Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method\n* Male subjects must not freeze or donate sperm starting at screening and throughout the study period, and at least 6 months after the final study drug administration.
