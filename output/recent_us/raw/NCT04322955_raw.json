    "official_title": "A Single-Arm, Open-Label, Pilot Study and Expansion Study of JAK Inhibitor Itacitinib for the Prophylaxis of Graft-Versus-Host Disease and Cytokine Release Syndrome After T-cell Replete Haploidentical Peripheral Blood Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation",
    "inclusion_criteria": "Patients must meet the following criteria within 30 days prior to Day 0 unless otherwise noted.\n\n* Diagnosis of a hematological malignancy listed below:\n\n  * Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) in complete morphological remission (based on International Working Group (IWG) Criteria)\n  * Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) in complete morphological remission (MRD negative, based on IWG Criteria)\n  * Myelodysplastic syndrome with ≤ 5% blasts in bone marrow.\n  * Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) or Hodgkin's disease (HD) in 2nd or greater complete or partial remission.\n* Planned treatment is myeloablative or reduced intensity conditioning followed by T Cell-replete peripheral blood haploidentical donor transplantation\n* Available human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-haploidentical donor who meets the following criteria:\n\n  * Blood-related family member, including (but not limited to) sibling, offspring, cousin, nephew, or parent. Younger donors should be prioritized.\n  * At least 18 years of age\n  * HLA-haploidentical donor/recipient match by at least low-resolution typing per institutional standards.\n  * In the investigator's opinion, is in general good health, and medically able to tolerate leukapheresis required for harvesting hematopoietic stem cells (HSC).\n  * No active hepatitis.\n  * Negative for human T-cell lymphotrophic virus (HTLV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).\n  * Not pregnant.\n  * Safety Lead-In Phase: For the first three patients, the donor must consent to a second product collection should it prove necessary.\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 2\n* Adequate organ function as defined below:\n\n  * Total bilirubin must be within normal range at baseline\n  * Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)(SGOT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (SGPT) ≤ 3.0 x institutional upper limit of normal (IULN).\n  * Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x IULN OR creatinine clearance ≥ 45 mL/min/1.73 m^2 by Cockcroft-Gault Formula.\n  * Oxygen saturation ≥ 90% on room air.\n  * Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 40%.\n  * Forced expiratory volume (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) ≥ 40% predicted, diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCOc) ≥ 40% predicted. If DLCO is < 40%, patients will still be considered eligible if deemed safe after a pulmonary evaluation.\n* At least 18 years of age at the time of study registration\n* Able to understand and willing to sign an Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved written informed consent document (or that of legally authorized representative, if applicable).\n* Must be able to receive GVHD prophylaxis with tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and cyclophosphamide\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Must not have undergone a prior allogeneic donor (related, unrelated, or cord) transplant. Prior autologous transplant is not exclusionary.\n* Presence of donor-specific antibodies (DSA) with Mean Fluorescence Intensity (MFI) of ≥2000 as assessed by the single antigen bead assay.\n* Known HIV or active hepatitis B or C infection.\n* Known hypersensitivity to one or more of the study agents, including Ruxolitinib and Itacitinib.\n* Must not have myelofibrosis (unless they are enrolled Amendment #5 or later) or other disease known to prolong neutrophil engraftment to > 35 days after transplant.\n* Must not receive antithymocyte globulin as part of pre-transplant conditioning regimens.\n* Currently receiving or has received any investigational drugs within the 14 days prior to the first dose of study drug (Day -3).\n* Pregnant and/or breastfeeding.\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, autoimmune disease, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, unstable cardiac arrhythmias, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* Immunosuppressive doses of steroids. Subjects with steroids for adrenal insufficiency will not be excluded.\n\nAdditional Inclusion Criteria Under Amendment 5\n\n* Five subjects with myelofibrosis will be enrolled in the expansion phase.\n* Three patients whose donors fail to collect the target number of CD34+ cells and the treating physician choses to move forward with the haplo-HCT will be enrolled in the expansion phase.",
