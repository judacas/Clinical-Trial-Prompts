Adult formulation group: ≥ 14 and less than 18 years of age and body weight of ≥ 40 kg at study entry.\n\n* Participants with Ph+ CML-CP must meet all of the following laboratory values at the screening visit. In the case where bone marrow blast and promyelocyte counts are available, these will be accepted if done within 56 days prior to the screening visit, to avoid unnecessary repetition of this test.\n\n  1. < 15% blasts in peripheral blood and bone marrow\n  2. < 30% combined blasts plus promyelocytes in peripheral blood and bone marrow\n  3. < 20% basophils in the peripheral blood\n  4.
