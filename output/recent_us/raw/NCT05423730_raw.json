    "official_title": "CAMBRIA-2: A Phase III, Open-Label, Randomised Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of Camizestrant (AZD9833, a Next Generation, Oral Selective Estrogen Receptor Degrader) vs Standard Endocrine Therapy (Aromatase Inhibitor or Tamoxifen) as Adjuvant Treatment for Patients With ER+/HER2- Early Breast Cancer and an Intermediate-High or High Risk of Recurrence Who Have Completed Definitive Locoregional Treatment and Have No Evidence of Disease",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Women and Men; ≥18 years at the time of screening (or per national guidelines)\n* Histologically confirmed ER+/HER2- early-stage resected invasive breast cancer with absence of any evidence of metastatic disease as defined in the protocol.\n* Completed adequate (definitive) locoregional therapy (surgery with or without radiotherapy) for the primary breast tumour(s), with or without (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy.\n* Patients must be randomised within 12 months of definitive breast surgery.\n* Patients may have received up to 12 weeks of endocrine therapy prior to randomisation.\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of ≤ 1\n* Adequate organ and bone marrow function\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 130 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Inoperable locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer\n* Pathological complete response following treatment with neoadjuvant therapy\n* History of any other cancer (except non-melanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix or considered a very low risk of recurrence per investigator judgement) unless in complete remission with no therapy for a minimum of 5 years from the date of randomisation\n* Any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic diseases which, in the investigator's opinion precludes participation in the study or compliance \"\n* Known LVEF <50% with heart failure NYHA Grade ≥2.\n* Mean resting QTcF interval > 480 ms at screening\n* Concurrent exogenous reproductive hormone therapy or non topical hormonal therapy for non-cancer-related conditions\n* Any concurrent anti-cancer treatment not specified in the protocol with the exception of bisphosphonates (e.g. zoledronic acid) or RANKL inhibitors ( eg, denosumab)\n* Previous treatment with camizestrant, investigational SERDs/investigational ER targeting agents, or fulvestrant\n* Currently pregnant (confirmed with positive serum pregnancy test) or breastfeeding.\n* Patients with known hypersensitivity to active or inactive excipients of camizestrant or drugs with a similar chemical structure or class to camizestrant. In pre-/peri-menopausal female and male patients, known hypersensitivity or intolerance to LHRH agonists that would preclude the patient from receiving any LHRH agonist.",
