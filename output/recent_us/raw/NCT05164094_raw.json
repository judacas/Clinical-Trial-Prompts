    "official_title": "A Pilot Study of FDG-PET Variability to Establish Biology-Guided Treatment Planning Feasibility for Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Patients who are offered radiotherapy using a 5-fraction stereotactic body radiation therapy course, at the recommendation of the treating radiation oncologist\n* Patients with early non-small cell lung carcinoma, or clinically-diagnosed early stage lung cancer, or pulmonary metastases\n* Patients with a limited (1-5) number of metastatic foci outside of the thorax who are candidates for consolidative treatment with SBRT\n* Patient with either a single focus or multiple foci (multi-isocentric planning) of disease in the thorax amenable to SBRT with at least one focus with at least 1.5 cm or larger in its largest diameter\n* Patients who are planned to receive either chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, or no additional cancer-directed drug therapy\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Prior radiation therapy which would provide significant dose overlap with the planned target volume(s) delivered within 30 days of enrollment or registration\n* Major invasive surgical procedure occurring between the first treatment-eligible PET/CT examination and end of radiotherapy that would affect the treatment target region\n* Patients with minimal FDG-avidity localized to the planned treatment target (e.g. maximum standardized uptake value [SUV] < 4.0)\n* Pregnancy",
