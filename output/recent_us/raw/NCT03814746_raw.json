A participant that meets this exclusion criterion but is otherwise deemed eligible for the study may be randomized across the specific intervention groups.\n* Has symptomatic ascites, pleural effusion, or pericardial effusion. A participant who is clinically stable following treatment for these conditions is eligible\n* Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy (in dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior the first dose of study intervention\n* Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or has required active treatment within the past 3 years\n* Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis.
