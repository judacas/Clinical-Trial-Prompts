If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required.\n8. Demonstrate adequate organ function as defined below. All screening labs should be performed within 10 days prior to apheresis.\n\nAbsolute lymphocyte count ≥ 500/mm3, Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1,000 /mcL, Platelets ≥ 100,000 / mcL, Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL (or ≥5.6 mmol/L without transfusion or EPO dependency (within 7 days of assessment), BUN ≤ 1.5 X upper limit of normal (ULN), Serum creatinine within the normal limits OR Measured or calculated creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min/1.73m2, Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X ULN OR AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) ≤ 5 X ULN, Albumin >2.5 mg/dL, International Normalized Ratio (INR) or Prothrombin Time (PT) ≤1.5 X ULN, unless subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants\n\ni. Additional inclusion criteria for sub-cohort: MGMT unmethylated according to UVA pathology testing\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Patients with a diagnosis of another malignancy within 3 years of being on-study. Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin, or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical cancer. Patients must not be on any treatment for another malignancy.\n2. Patients with evidence of leptomeningeal dissemination or subependymal spread on initial MRI.\n3. Patients with extracranial metastases.\n4. Known hypersensitivity to cetuximab or other EGFR antibody.\n5. Alpha 1,3 Galactose IgE (\"alpha gal\") test result outside of the reference range (indicating likely hypersensitivity to cetuximab)\n6. Evidence of active bleeding or bleeding diathesis.\n7. Cardiac Status: Patients will be ineligible for treatment on this protocol if (prior to protocol entry):\n\n   There is a history of a recent (within one year) myocardial infarction or stroke.\n\n   There is a current or prior history of angina/coronary symptoms requiring medications and/or evidence of depressed left ventricular function (LVEF < 45% by MUGA or ECHO).\n\n   There is clinical evidence of congestive heart failure requiring medical management (irrespective of MUGA or ECHO results).\n8. Has Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies) or known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA [qualitative] is detected).\n9. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy.\n10. Has received any treatment for GBM besides surgery.\n11. Females must not be breastfeeding.\n12. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.\n13. A patient may be excluded if, in the opinion of the treating clinician, the patient is not capable of being compliant.",
