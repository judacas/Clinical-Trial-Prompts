    "official_title": "An Exploratory Study of 89Zr-DFO-Atezolizumab ImmunoPET/CT in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Patients with suspected renal cell carcinoma with planned surgery or patients with metastatic RCC and a tissue diagnosis. (In standard clinical practice, biopsy is not routinely performed in patients who will be having surgery).\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent.\n* Patient must be able to lie still for a 30 to 60 minute PET/CT scan.\n* One of the following:\n\n  1. Patients with locally advanced RCC planned for surgery determined to be a high risk of recurrence, defined by presence of at least clinical T2 or TxN1, OR patients with metastatic RCC for whom treatment with cytoreductive nephrectomy and/or metastasectomy is planned by the treating physician.\n  2. Patients with metastatic RCC for whom immuno-oncology (IO) therapy is planned.\n* Women of child-bearing potential must agree to undergo and have documented a negative pregnancy test on the day of 89Zr-DFO-Atezolizumab administration. A female of child-bearing potential is any woman (regardless of sexual orientation, having undergone a tubal ligation, or remaining celibate by choice) who meets the following criteria:\n\n  * Has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or\n  * Has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months).\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* History of severe allergic, anaphylactic, or other hypersensitivity reactions to atezolizumab or any other chimeric or humanized antibodies.\n* Uncontrolled severe and irreversible intercurrent illness or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* Subjects must not be pregnant or nursing due to the potential for congenital abnormalities and the potential of this regimen to harm nursing infants.\n* Significant autoimmune disease requiring treatment with either prednisone (or steroid equivalent) at a dose > 10 mg/day or other immunosuppressive agents. (Replacement steroid therapy is acceptable).\n* Any patient for whom ICI therapy would be contraindicated for other reasons. Patients with adverse reactions to ICI therapy may undergo second 89Zr-DFO-Atezolizumab injection and PET/CT at the discretion of the treating physician considering that the dose of antibody represents 1% of a single therapeutic dose and therefore unlikely to cause adverse events.\n* Subjects unable to provide informed consent.\n* Subjects who are claustrophobic or have other contraindications to PET/CT.\n* Subjects must not weigh more than the maximum weight limit for the table for the PET/CT scanner where the study is being performed. (>200 kg or 440 lbs).",
