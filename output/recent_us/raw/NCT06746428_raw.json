    "official_title": "A Phase 1b Study of Gemcitabine and Leflunomide in Patients With Unresectable Pancreatic Cancer",
    "inclusion_criteria": "* Documented informed consent of the participant and/or legally authorized representative.\n\n  * Adult patients lacking capacity to consent may participate if they have a caretaker that could ensure oral medication compliance.\n* Agreement to allow the use of archival tissue from diagnostic tumor biopsies.\n\n  * If unavailable, exceptions may be granted with study principal investigator (PI) approval.\n* Age: ≥ 18 years.\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) ≤ 1.\n* Subjects must have histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced unresectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA).\n* Measurable or evaluable disease according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v) 1.1\n* Potential patients must have plans of receiving single agent gemcitabine.\n* Fully recovered from the acute toxic effects (except alopecia or neuropathy) to ≤ grade 1 to prior anti-cancer therapy.\n* Without bone marrow involvement: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,500/mm^3 NOTE: Growth factor is not permitted within 14 days of ANC assessment unless cytopenia is secondary to disease involvement.\n* Without bone marrow involvement: Platelets ≥ 100,000/mm^3 NOTE: Platelet transfusions are not permitted within 14 days of platelet assessment unless cytopenia is secondary to disease involvement.\n* Hemoglobin ≥ 9g/dL NOTE: Red blood cell transfusions are not permitted within 14 days of hemoglobin assessment unless cytopenia is secondary to disease involvement.\n* Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) OR direct bilirubin ≤ ULN for participants with total bilirubin levels > 1.5 x ULN (unless has Gilbert's disease total bilirubin ≤ 3 x ULN)\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 1.5 x ULN OR if liver metastases ≤ 3 x ULN\n* Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 1.5 x ULN OR if liver metastases ≤ 2 x ULN\n* Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN OR creatinine clearance (Cockcroft Gault) of ≥ 50 mL/min for participants with a creatinine level of > 1.5 x ULN.\n* Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP): negative urine or serum pregnancy test If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required.\n* Agreement by females and males of childbearing potential to use an effective method of birth control or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course of the study through at least 6 months after the last dose of gemcitabine therapy for women and at least 3 months after the last dose of gemcitabine therapy for men, and/or undergo drug elimination of leflunomide at end of treatment until leflunomide is undetectable in the plasma.\n\n  * Childbearing potential defined as not being surgically sterilized (men and women) or have not been free from menses for > 1 year (women only).\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Chemotherapy, radiation therapy, biological therapy, immunotherapy within 21 days prior to day 1 of protocol therapy.\n* Drugs metabolized by CYP2C8, CYP1A2, BCRP, OATP1B1/B3, and OAT3 transporters within 21 days prior to day 1 of protocol therapy.\n* Herbal medications (excluding cannabidiol [CBD]).\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to study agent.\n* Issues with tolerating oral medication (e.g. inability to swallow pills, malabsorption issues, ongoing nausea or vomiting).\n* Positive for tuberculosis or latent tuberculosis (TB).\n* Active diarrhea.\n* Clinically significant uncontrolled illness.\n* Active infection requiring antibiotics.\n* Known history of immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection. (*If seropositive for HIV, HCV or HBV, nucleic acid quantitation must be performed. Viral load must be undetectable.)\n* Diagnosis of Gilbert's disease.\n* Prior malignancy other than carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or nonmelanoma skin cancer, unless that prior malignancy was diagnosed and definitively treated 5 or more years prior to study entry with no subsequent evidence of recurrence. Patients with a history of low grade (Gleason score ≤ 6 = Gleason group 1) localized prostate cancer will be eligible even if diagnosed less than 5 years prior to study entry. Other malignancies with low probability of recurrence may be allowed with PI approval.\n* Females only: Pregnant or breastfeeding.\n* Any other condition that would, in the Investigator's judgment, contraindicate the patient's participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns with clinical study procedures.\n* Prospective participants who, in the opinion of the investigator, may not be able to comply with all study procedures (including compliance issues related to feasibility/logistics).",
