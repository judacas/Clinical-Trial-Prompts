This lesion cannot be biopsied at any time during the study. Note: if there is only one lesion available for biopsy and radiographic assessment, it may be permitted to be biopsied after discussion with sponsor.\n* Subjects with treated brain metastases are eligible provided they meet the following criteria: Definitive therapy was completed at least 2 weeks prior to enrollment. No evidence of radiographic CNS progression or CNS disease following definitive therapy and by the time of study screening. Patients manifesting progression in lesions previously treated with stereotactic radiosurgery may still be eligible if pseudoprogression can be demonstrated by appropriate means and after discussion with the medical monitor.\n* Any CNS disease is asymptomatic, any neurologic symptoms due to CNS disease have returned to baseline or are deemed irreversible, the patient is off steroids for at least 7 days (physiologic doses of steroids are permitted), and the patient is off or on stable doses of anti-epileptic drugs for malignant CNS disease.\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of less than or equal to 2.\n* Hematologic function, as follows without growth factor support within 2 weeks prior to study day 1: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 1.0 x 10E9/L; Platelet count greater than or equal to 75 x 10E9/L; Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 9 g/dL (90 g/L).\n* Adequate renal laboratory assessments, as follows: Estimated glomerular filtration rate based on MDRD (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease) calculation . 60 ml/min/1.73 m^2 for Cohorts 1, 2, and 4 Estimated glomerular filtration rate based on MDRD (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease) calculation >= 45 ml/min/1.73 m^2 for Cohorts 3, 6, 7, 8 and 9.\n* Hepatic function, as follows: Total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN or less than or equal to 3 x ULN for subjects with liver metastasis; AST less than or equal to 3 x ULN or less than or equal to' 5 x ULN for subjects with liver metastasis; ALT less than or equal to 3 x ULN or less than or equal to 5 x ULN for subjects with liver metastasis; Alkaline phosphatase less than or equal to 2.5 x ULN or less than or equal to 5 x ULN for subjects with liver metastasis (Note: elevated alkaline phosphatase is acceptable if it is due to non-hepatic associated pathology [eg, bone disease]).\n* Subjects enrolled to Cohorts 7-9 must submit tumor tissue sample. Fresh tumor biopsies may be performed if subject has a readily accessible tumor lesion and who consent to the biopsies. If fresh biopsies cannot be obtained, archival tumor samples are acceptable. Prior to enrollment it is required to determine that there is enough tumor tissue available to be sent to the central laboratory: Cohorts 7 and 9: Archival tissue collected up to 12 months prior to screening date is permitted. Biopsies collected between 12-18 months prior to screening are allowed upon discussion with the medical monitor. Subjects with EBV associated nasopharyngeal carcinoma may submit biopsy with EBV test results from within 36 months prior to screening; Cohort 8: Archival tissue with MSI-high/dMMR test results collected up to 36 months prior to screening is permitted.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years\nMust have maximum age of 100 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Disease Related. Primary brain tumor, untreated or symptomatic brain metastases and leptomeningeal disease (exception: benign asymptomatic tumors are permitted).\n* Other Medical Conditions. History of other malignancy within the past 2 years, with the following exception[s]: Malignancy treated with curative intent and with no known active disease present for greater than or equal to 2 years before enrollment and felt to be at low risk for recurrence by the treating physician. Adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer or lentigo maligna without evidence of disease. Adequately treated cervical carcinoma in situ without evidence of disease. Adequately treated breast ductal carcinoma in situ without evidence of disease. Prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia without evidence of prostate cancer. Adequately treated urothelial papillary noninvasive carcinoma or carcinoma in situ. Other malignancies which do not require systemic therapy, may be considered upon discussion with the medical monitor.\n* History of solid organ transplantation.\n* Major surgery within 28 days of study day 1.\n* Prior/Concomitant Therapy: Prior treatment with anti-programmed death 1 (PD-1), anti-PD-L1, CTLA-4 or other checkpoint inhibitor drugs\n* Anti-tumor therapy (radiotherapy, chemotherapy, antibody therapy, molecular targeted therapy, or investigational agent) within 21 days prior to study day 1.
