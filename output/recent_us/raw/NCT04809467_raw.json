History of interstitial lung disease (e.g., pneumonitis or pulmonary fibrosis)\n7. Evidence or history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy\n8. Radiotherapy ≤ 28 days of enrollment. Patients must be recovered from all acute radiotherapy-related toxicities. No radiopharmaceuticals (strontium, samarium) within 8 weeks of enrollment\n9.

Ongoing adverse effects from prior systemic treatment > CTCAE Grade 1 (with the exception of Grade 2 alopecia)\n11. Participation in another therapeutic clinical study or receiving any investigational agent within 28 days of enrollment or during this clinical study\n12. Corneal defects, corneal ulcerations, keratitis, keratoconus, history of corneal transplant, or other known abnormalities of the cornea that may pose an increased risk of developing a corneal ulcer\n13.
