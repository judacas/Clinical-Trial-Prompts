    "inclusion_criteria": "* Consent/Assent: all patients and/or their parents or legally authorized representatives must sign written informed consent; assent, when appropriate, will be obtained according to institutional guidelines\n* Weight/Age: patients must be ≥40 kg at the time of study enrollment, but may be of any age\n* Diagnosis: Patients must have histologically documented locally advanced or metastatic disease confirmed at MSK as follows:\n\n  * Main cohort: Ewing sarcoma as molecularly defined by an EWSR1 fusion with an ETS-transcription factor family member including FLI1, ERG, ETV1, ETV4, and FEV\n  * Pilot cohort: Ewing-like sarcomas including CIC-rearranged sarcoma, BCOR-rearranged sarcoma, and sarcomas with a rearrangement between EWSR1 and a non-ETS family gene or desmoplastic small round cell tumor as molecularly defined by an EWSR1-WT1 fusion\n\nNote: Any patient being enrolled into the pilot cohort that does not have a CIC, BCOR- rearranged sarcoma, or desmoplastic small round cell tumor will be reviewed with study pathologist, Dr. Cristina Antonescu, to ensure the categorization as Ewing-like sarcoma is appropriate\n\n* Patients must be able to swallow capsules\n* Therapeutic options: patient's current disease state must be one which has failed standard cytotoxic chemotherapy including cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/vincristine and ifosfamide/etoposide\n* Disease Status: patients must have measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1\n* Performance level: Karnofsky ≥70% for patients >16 years of age and Lansky ≥70 for patients ≤16 years of age\n* Prior Therapy: patients may have had any number of regimens and must meet the following minimum duration from prior anti-cancer directed therapy prior to enrollment\n\nNote: Patients who have previously received gemcitabine will be allowed unless they had hypersensitivity or unacceptable toxicity attributed to gemcitabine\n\n* ≥ 21 days must have elapsed after the last dose of cytotoxic or myelosuppressive chemotherapy and patients must have recovered from the acute toxic effects of these agents (other than alopecia)\n* ≥ 14 days must have elapsed after radiation therapy, and toxicity related to prior radiation therapy must be recovered to grade ≤ 1\n* ≥ 21 days must have elapsed after the last dose of antibody therapy, and toxicity related to prior antibody therapy must be recovered to grade ≤ 1\n\nOrgan Function Requirements:\n\n* Adequate bone marrow function defined as:\n\n  * Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1500/mm3\n  * Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3\n  * Hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dl\n* Adequate renal function defined as estimated glomerular filtration (eGFR) rate ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73m2:\n\n  * as estimated by CKD-EPI equation for patients ≥ 18 years of age OR\n  * As estimated by cystatin C for patients < 18 years of age\n* Adequate liver function defined as:\n\n  * Bilirubin (sum of conjugated + unconjugated) ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal for age\n  * AST or ALT ≤ 2.5 x upper limit of normal for patients without liver metastases\n  * AST or ALT ≤ 5 x upper limit of normal for patients with liver metastases\n  * Serum albumin ≥ 2.5 g/dl\n* Adequate cardiac function defined as:\n\n  * Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) >45% as measured on echocardiogram, cardiac MRI, or MUGA\n  * QTc < 470 ms on screening 12 lead electrocardiogram\n* Pregnancy/Contraception\n\n  * Post-menarchal females must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test at screening and ≤ 24 hours prior to study treatment\n  * Males or females of reproductive potential must be willing to use a barrier method of contraception throughout the course of the study and for 6 months after completing study treatment\nHealthy volunteers allowed",
    "exclusion_criteria": "* Patients for whom the investigator deems that gemcitabine is not appropriate\n* Patients who have an uncontrolled infection\n* Central Nervous System (CNS) Metastases\n\n  * Patients who have symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastases. Note: patients with treated and asymptomatic CNS metastases are eligible.\n  * Patients with CNS metastases requiring corticosteroids for management\n  * If the treatment of CNS disease requires anticonvulsants, the dose must have been stable for ≥ 4 weeks.\n* Patients who are pregnant or breast feeding\n* Patients who have a history of Torsades de Pointes, carry a diagnosis of congestive heart failure, or have a family history of prolonged QT syndrome\n* Patients who, in the opinion of the investigator, may not be able to comply with the safety monitoring requirements of the study\n* Patients with known hypersensitivity to gemcitabine",
