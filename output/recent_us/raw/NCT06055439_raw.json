    "official_title": "A Phase II Study of Pre-Operative Stereotactic Radiosurgery Followed by Surgical Resection for Brain Metastases",
    "inclusion_criteria": "1. Histologic proof or unequivocal cytologic proof of solid tumor malignancy. This may be obtained from either the primary site or any metastatic site\n2. Solid tumor brain metastases\n3. Age≥ 18 years\n4. Karnofsky Performance Status ≥70\n5. Patient must have agreed to undergo surgical resection to manage at least 1 brain metastasis\n6. Maximum tumor diameter of index lesions <5 cm. (Index lesion defined as the brain metastasis which will undergo surgical resection)\n7. Brain MRI within 1 month of initiation of brain SRS\n8. No prior whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) or radiation therapy directed to index brain metastases\n9. Patients of childbearing potential (male or female) must practice adequate contraception due to possible harmful effects of radiation therapy on an unborn child\n10. Patient must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document\n11. All patients must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and must be given written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines\n12. Patients receiving prior SRS for brain metastases in other locations of the brain are eligible\n13. Patients with multiple brain metastases planned for surgical intervention are eligible for this study. Each individual brain metastasis will be treated\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusion_criteria": "1. Prior WBRT or SRS to the index lesion\n2. Brain metastasis greater than or equal to (≤) 5 cm in maximum diameter\n3. Patients must not have a serious medical or psychiatric illness that would in the opinion of the treating physician prevent informed consent or completion of protocol treatment, and/or follow-up visits.\n4. Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) less than (<)70.\n5. Patients with absolute contraindication to MRI imaging are not eligible for the study\n6. Patients who are pregnant are excluded from the study.",
