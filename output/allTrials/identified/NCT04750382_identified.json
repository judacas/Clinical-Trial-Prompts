Understand this protocol and be willing and able to adhere to the study visit schedule.\n* Age 18-70 years old, male or female.\n* Diagnosed with stage IV or recurrent or metastatic TNBC who are not suitable for surgical treatment.\n* Histopathology shows that ER, PR and HER-2 are all negative. If metastasis exists, the histopathology result of metastasis is preferred. ER and PR negative are defined as ER < 1% and PR < 1%. HER-2 negative is defined as HER-2 (-) or (+) in immunohistochemical test. For HER-2 (++), additional negative result should be observed in FISH test. For HER-2 (-) or (+), FISH test is optional, but the result should be negative.\n* Have not been treated with any chemotherapy drugs for recurrent and metastatic triple negative breast cancer (adjuvant / neoadjuvant therapy is allowed, if the time between the last dose of drug and recurrence or metastasis is more than 6 months).\n* Has a performance status of 0 or 1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Score.\n* Life expectancy ≥ 3 months.\n* Has at least one measurable extracranial lesion according to RECIST1.1, which has not been treated with radiotherapy.\n* Has sufficient organ and bone marrow function to meet the following laboratory examination standards:\n\n  1.
