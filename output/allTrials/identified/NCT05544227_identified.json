Malignant pleural effusions or ascites that require immediate intervention\n9. Prior history of autoimmune disease except hypothyroidism, uncontrolled or unmanaged diabetes, cardiac arrhythmia (unstable or untreated), hypersensitivity, or other illness or disease that in the opinion of the Principal Investigator, with consultation with Syncromune's Chief Medical Officer, makes the subject a poor candidate.\n10. Any primary or acquired immunodeficiency\n11. Active COVID infection or tests positive for COVID day before or day of planned treatment\n12. Known or suspected hepatitis B if active infection (subjects with chronic hepatitis B infection must have an undetectable Hepatitis B virus (HBV) viral load on suppressive therapy, if indicated; positive surface antibody alone is not an exclusion)\n13. Known or suspected hepatitis C infection which has not been treated and cured unless currently on treatment with an undetectable viral load\n14. Any condition(s) that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would increase the risk for toxicities from study drug, interfere with subject compliance or conduct of this study.",
