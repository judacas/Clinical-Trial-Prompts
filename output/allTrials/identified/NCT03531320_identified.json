If a woman of childbearing potential, patient must use a medically acceptable form of contraception as 2 barrier methods (e.g., combination of condom, diaphragm, or intrauterine device), hormonal contraception (estrogen or progesterone agents) or 1 barrier method in combination with spermicide. Birth control is required 1 month prior to screening, for the duration of their study participation, and for 1 month after the end of the study; female partners of male patients must adhere to the same birth control methods.\n15. Patient is willing to comply with protocol-required visit schedule and visit requirements\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
        "exclusion_criteria": "1. Part 2 only: More than one prior chemotherapy regimen for unresectable metastatic or locally advanced BTC Note: prior radiation (with or without radiosensitizing doses of chemotherapy) or fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy are allowed as postsurgical adjuvant therapy.\n2. Part 2 only: Received any systemic therapy (chemotherapy, biologics, immunotherapy, or investigational agents) for metastatic disease other than gemcitabine based chemotherapy or CCRT for locally advanced BTC\n3. Diagnosis of active malignancy (other than GI cancer [Part 1] or BTC [Part 2]) within the past 2 years, except nonmelanoma skin carcinoma and carcinoma-in-situ of uterine cervix treated with curative intent\n4.

Part 2 only: Evidence of disease progression, based on the Investigator's assessment, on the screening computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan\n9. Any active disease or condition that would not permit compliance with the protocol\n10. Residual toxicity from prior chemotherapy or CCRT that is Grade ≥2 (residual Grade 2 neuropathy and alopecia are permitted)\n11. Clinically significant cardiovascular disease (e.g., uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, or New York Heart Association [NYHA] Grade 2 or greater), or uncontrolled serious cardiac arrhythmia\n12. Patient has a history of drug or alcohol abuse within last year\n13. Patient has documented cerebrovascular disease\n14. Patient has a seizure disorder not controlled on medication (based on decision of Investigator)\n15. Patient received an investigational agent within 28 days of enrollment\n16. Patients with uncontrolled active viral, bacterial, or systemic fungal infection\n17. Patient has known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection\n18. Patient has hepatitis B virus (HBV) and/or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in medical history.
