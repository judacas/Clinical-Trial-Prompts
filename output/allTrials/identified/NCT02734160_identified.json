Participants who have received prior neoadjuvant therapy and who now have metastatic disease must have received 1 of the following for their metastatic disease: FOLFIRINOX, nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel/gemcitabine, TS-1 (tegafur gimeracil oteracil potassium), irinotecan liposome injection/5-fluorouracil (5FU)/Leucovorin or single-agent gemcitabine prior to enrolment in this study.\n* Dose Escalation: Able and willing to give valid written consent to undergo a new tumour biopsy (prior to study treatment) or to provide an available archival tumour sample if taken <3 years prior to enrolment if a new tumour biopsy is not feasible with an acceptable clinical risk.\n* Cohort Expansion: Able and willing to give valid written consent to undergo a new tumour biopsy (prior to study treatment). Able and willing to undergo a second tumour biopsy on treatment. Where possible, tumour lesions used for new biopsies should not be the same lesions used as RECIST target lesions, unless there are no other lesions suitable for biopsy. Archival samples may be required if there is inadequate tissue in the biopsy specimen.\n* Have adequate organ function.\n* Have a performance status of 0 or 1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale.\n* Use approved contraceptive methods.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
