        "inclusion_criteria": "Patients who meet each of the following criteria will be considered \"eligible\":\n\n* Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.\n* Disease must be considered incurable. Incurable is defined as metastatic disease or a local or regional recurrence in a previously irradiated site that is unresectable (or patient declines resection).\n* Measurable disease defined as lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as >10 mm with CT scan, as >20 mm by chest x-ray, or >10 mm with calipers by clinical exam.\n* Patients may have received pembrolizumab, platins, cetuximab or other chemotherapies in the metastatic setting, but do not need to have received cetuximab.\n* Measurable disease per RECIST v1.1 as determined by the investigator;\n* The subject has had an assessment of all known disease sites e.g., by computerized tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), bone scan as appropriate, within 28 days before the first dose of cabozantinib.\n* A CT of the neck and a CT of the chest will be required at baseline for all patients.\n* The subject is ≥ 18 years old on the day of consent.\n* The subject has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.\n* Recovery to baseline or ≤ Grade 1 CTCAE v.5.0 from toxicities related to any prior treatments, unless AE(s) are clinically nonsignificant and/or stable on supportive therapy.\n* The subject has organ and marrow function and laboratory values as follows within 14 days before the first dose of cabozantinib.\n\n  1. The ANC ≥ 1500/mm3 without colony stimulating factor support.\n  2. White blood cell count ≥ 2500/mm3 (≥ 2.5 GI/L).\n  3. Platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3;\n  4. Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL;\n  5. Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x the ULN. For subjects with known Gilbert's disease, bilirubin ≤ 3.0 mg/dL;\n  6. Albumin ≥ 2.8 g/dl;\n  7. Creatinine ≤ 2.0 x ULN or creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥ 40 mL/min. For creatinine clearance estimation, the Cockcroft and Gault equation should be used:\n\n  i. Male: CrCl (mL/min) = (140 - age) × wt (kg) / (creatinine × 72); h. Female: Multiply above result by 0.85; Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) ≤ 3 x upper limit of normal (ULN). ALP ≤ 5 x ULN with documented bone metastases.\n\n  i. Lipase < 2.0 x the upper limit of normal and no radiologic or clinical evidence of pancreatitis.\n\n  j. UPCR ≤ 1. k. Phosphorus, calcium, magnesium and potassium ≥ LLN.\n* The subject is capable of understanding and complying with the protocol requirements and has signed the informed consent document;\n* Sexually active subjects (men and women) must agree to use medically accepted barrier methods of contraception (e.g., male or female condom) during the course of the study and for 4 months after the last dose of study drug(s), even if oral contraceptives are also used. All subjects of reproductive potential must agree to use both a barrier method and a second method of birth control during the course of the study and for 4 months after the last dose of study drug(s).\n* Female subjects of childbearing potential must not be pregnant at screening. Females of childbearing potential are defined as premenopausal females capable of becoming pregnant (i.e., females who have had any evidence of menses in the past 12 months, with the exception of those who had prior hysterectomy). However, women who have been amenorrheic for 12 or more months are still considered to be of childbearing potential if the amenorrhea is possibly due to prior chemotherapy, antiestrogens, low body weight, ovarian suppression or other reasons.\n* No Grade 3-4 hypersensitivity reaction to cetuximab.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
