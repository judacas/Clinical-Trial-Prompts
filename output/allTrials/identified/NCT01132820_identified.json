        "inclusion_criteria": "* Patients must have recurrent or persistent endometrial carcinoma, which is refractory to curative therapy or established treatments; histologic confirmation of the original primary tumor is required\n\n  * Patients with the following histologic epithelial cell types are eligible: endometrioid adenocarcinoma, serous adenocarcinoma, undifferentiated carcinoma, clear cell adenocarcinoma, mixed epithelial carcinoma, adenocarcinoma not otherwise specified (N.O.S.), mucinous adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and transitional cell carcinoma\n* All patients must have measurable disease; measurable disease is defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (version 1.1); measurable disease is defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded); each lesion must be >= 10 mm when measured by computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or caliper measurement by clinical exam; or >= 20 mm when measured by chest x-ray; lymph nodes must be >= 15 mm in short axis when measured by CT or MRI\n* Patients must have at least one \"target lesion\" to be used to assess response on this protocol as defined by RECIST version 1.1; tumors within a previously irradiated field will be designated as \"non-target\" lesions unless progression is documented or a biopsy is obtained to confirm persistence at least 90 days following completion of radiation therapy\n* Patients must not be eligible for a higher priority Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) protocol, if one exists; in general, this would refer to any active GOG Phase III protocol or Rare Tumor protocol for the same patient population\n* Patients who have received one prior regimen must have a GOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2; patients who have received two prior regimens must have a GOG performance status of 0 or 1\n* Recovery from effects of recent surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy\n\n  * Patients should be free of active infection requiring antibiotics (with the exception of uncomplicated urinary tract infection [UTI])\n  * Any hormonal therapy directed at the malignant tumor must be discontinued at least one week prior to registration\n  * Any other prior therapy directed at the malignant tumor must be discontinued at least three weeks prior to registration\n* Patients must have had one prior chemotherapeutic regimen for management of endometrial carcinoma; initial treatment may include chemotherapy, chemotherapy and radiation therapy, and/or consolidation/maintenance therapy; chemotherapy administered in conjunction with primary radiation as a radio-sensitizer WILL be counted as a systemic chemotherapy regimen\n* Patients are allowed to receive, but are not required to receive, one additional cytotoxic regimen for management of recurrent or persistent disease according to the following definition: cytotoxic regimens include any agent that targets the genetic and/or mitotic apparatus of dividing cells, resulting in dose-limiting toxicity to the bone marrow and/or gastrointestinal mucosa\n\n  * Note: Patients on this non-cytotoxic study are allowed to receive one additional cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen for management of recurrent or persistent disease, as defined above; however, due to the novel nature of biologic compounds, patients are encouraged to enroll on second-line non-cytotoxic studies prior to receiving additional cytotoxic therapy\n* Patients must have NOT received any non-cytotoxic chemotherapy for management of recurrent or persistent disease; prior hormonal therapy is allowed\n* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 1,500/mcl\n* Platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/mcl\n* Creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 x institutional upper limit normal (ULN) or creatinine (Cr) clearance >= 60 ml/min\n* Bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN)\n* Serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) (aspartate aminotransferase [AST]) less than or equal to 2.5 x ULN\n* Alkaline phosphatase less than or equal to 2.5 x ULN\n* Neuropathy (sensory and motor) less than or equal to grade 1\n* Urine protein creatinine (UPC) ratio must be < 1.0 gm\n\n  * If UPC ratio >= 1, collection of 24-hour urine measurement of urine protein is recommended\n* Prothrombin time (PT) such that international normalized ratio (INR) is =< 1.5 x ULN (or an in-range INR, usually between 2 and 3, if a patient is on a stable dose of therapeutic warfarin) and a partial thromboplastin time (PTT) =< 1.5 x ULN\n* Patients must have an amylase and lipase =< ULN\n* Patients must have a thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level and a free thyroxine (free T4) level within the institutional normal limits\n* Patients must have signed an approved informed consent and authorization permitting release of personal health information\n* Patients must meet pre-entry requirements as specified\n* Patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test prior to the study entry and be practicing an effective form of contraception\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be FEMALE\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
