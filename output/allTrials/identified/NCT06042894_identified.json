Agree to provide archived tumor tissue specimens (unstained sections (anti-slip)) from primary or metastatic sites within 2 years. 10 to 12 surgical specimens (4-5 μm thick) or fresh tissue samples if the subject is unable to provide them for 2 years tumor tissue samples from within, can be communicated with the sponsor if other inclusion criteria are met, enrollment was permitted after investigator assessment.\n7. Must have at least one measurable lesion according to RECIST v1.1 definition; So let's say that we've done this before radiotherapy-treated lesions were included only if there was definite disease progression in the lesion after radiotherapy measurable lesions were entered.\n8. Blood transfusions, the use of any cell growth factors, and/or blood transfusions were not allowed within 14 days before screening in the presence of a platelet drug, the organ function level must meet the following criteria:\n\n   1.
