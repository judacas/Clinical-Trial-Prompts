Patient may receive transfusion as needed.\n* Patient has the following blood chemistry levels at Baseline (obtained ≤14 days prior to randomization):\n\n  * AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 × upper limit of normal range (ULN).\n  * Total bilirubin ≤ ULN (Except in patients who have Gilbert's Syndrome or patients with recently placed stents for biliary obstruction when bilirubin should be < 1.5 X ULN).\n  * Serum Creatinine ≤ 1.5mg/dl OR calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 50 for those patients with creatinine greater than 1.5.\n  * CPK < ULN.\n  * Patients who have an elevated lipase or amylase and no history of autoimmune pancreatitis, nor physical exam concerning for, or CT correlates of pancreatitis can be enrolled. The elevated levels will serve as the new baseline. Changes above that will be termed toxicities as per CTCAE guidelines with relation to the new baseline.\n  * PT WNL+/- 15 % unless on active anticoagulation.\n  * PTT WNL+/- 15 % unless on active anticoagulation (suggested to be drawn peripherally to prevent port drawn elevation due to routine heparin flush of ports).\n* Age >18 years\n* Patient must be able to swallow enteral medications with no requirement for a feeding tube.

For this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. All females of childbearing potential (please refer to ECOG's definition in section 5.1) must have a blood test or urine study within two weeks prior to randomization to rule out pregnancy. Should a woman become pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. If a man impregnates a woman while participating in this study, he should inform his treating physician immediately as well.\n* Treatment with a live, attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment, or anticipation of need for such a vaccine during treatment with Avelumab or within 5 months after the last dose of Avelumab\n\n  - Attenuated live vaccines include but are not limited to:\n* Tuberculosis (BCG)\n* Oral polio vaccine\n* Measles, Mumps, Rubella, alone or as part of MMR\n* Rotavirus\n* Yellow Fever\n* Typhoid\n* Rabies vaccine should be utilized as recommended by an Infectious Disease specialist\n* Nasal flu vaccine\n* History of severe allergic anaphylactic reactions to chimeric or humanized antibodies or fusion proteins\n* Known hypersensitivity to Chinese hamster ovary cell products or recombinant human antibodies\n* Known allergy or hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs or any of their excipients\n* Treatment with systemic immunosuppressive medication (including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate, thalidomide, and anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha agents) within 2 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment, or anticipation of need for systemic immunosuppressive medication during the study, with the following exceptions:\n\n  * Patients who received acute, low-dose systemic immunosuppressant medication or a one-time pulse dose of systemic immunosuppressant medication (e.g., 48 hours of corticosteroids for a contrast allergy) are eligible for the study.\n  * Patients who received mineralocorticoids (e.g., fludrocortisone), corticosteroids for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma, or low-dose corticosteroids for orthostatic hypotension or adrenal insufficiency are eligible for the study.\n  * Intranasal, inhaled, topical steroids, or local steroid injection (e.g., intra-articular injection).\n* Patients requiring the use of enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic medication that includes but not limited to: phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, primidone or oxcarbazepine are excluded\n* Patients with previously documented macular degeneration or diabetic retinopathy are excluded\n* Baseline EKG with QTc > 470 msec (including subjects on medication). Subjects with ventricular pacemaker for whom QT interval is not measurable will be eligible on a case-by-case basis at MD discretion\n* Patients on Coumadin must be willing to switch to an alternative subcutaneous LMWH or oral agent (At PI discretion exceptions can be permitted, as determined on a case by case basis and documented)"
