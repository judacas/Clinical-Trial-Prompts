Human epidermal growth factor 2 (EGFR2, HER2) positive tumors must have failed therapy with at least 2 anti-HER2 agents\n   2. HER2 negative and either ER or PR positive tumors: must be refractory to hormonal therapy and previously treated with at least 2 hormone based targeted therapy containing regimens.\n   3. Triple-negative and inflammatory tumors must have exhausted other curative intent therapies including prior treatment with a taxane and platinum-based agent\n   4. All other MBC types must have exhausted other curative intent therapies including any genomic or germline directed targeted therapy having available approved drug(s)\n   5. Patients with new or progressive breast cancer metastatic to the brain will be eligible, provided:\n\n   i. The brain metastases must be clinically stable (without evidence of progressive disease by imaging) for at least 4 weeks, prior to first dose.\n\n   ii. There is no need for steroids and patients have not had steroids for at least 2 weeks prior to the first dose.\n2. Be 18 years of age or older.\n3. Have expected survival of at least 4 months.\n4. Have adequate performance status (up to and including ECOG 2)\n5. Patients must be stable with all known or expected toxicities from previous treatment including:\n\n   1. Prior immune related toxicity must not have exceeded Grade 2 with exception of stable endocrinopathy (endocrinopathy if well-managed, is not exclusionary).\n   2. Toxicity of prior therapy that has not recovered to â‰¤ grade 1 or baseline (with the exception of any grade of alopecia, adequately treated endocrinopathy, and anemia not requiring transfusion support).\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",

History of clinical hypersensitivity to any protocol specified therapy.\n6. BUN >30 in conjunction with a creatinine >2, or calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl) <30 mL/min (GFR can be used in place of creatinine or CrCl).\n7. Absolute granulocyte count < 1000; platelets <50,000.\n8. Bilirubin >2.0; alkaline phosphatase >4x upper limit of normal (ULN); ALT/AST >2x ULN. For patients with hepatic metastases, ALT/AST >5x ULN is exclusionary.\n9. Proteinuria >1+ on urinalysis or >1 gm/24hr.\n10. New York Heart Association stage 3 or 4 cardiac disease.\n11. A pleural or pericardial effusion of moderate severity or worse.\n12. Any woman of childbearing potential (i.e., has had a menstrual cycle within the past year and has not been surgically sterilized), unless she: agrees to take appropriate precautions to avoid becoming pregnant during the study and has a negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to starting treatment.\n13. Men who are fertile/reproductively competent, should take appropriate precautions to avoid fathering a child for the duration of the study.\n14. Women who are pregnant or nursing.\n15. Patients with concurrent second malignancy.\n16. Persons with previous malignancies requiring treatment within the past 24 months.\n17. Patients who have clinical or laboratory features indicative of AIDS and are HIV positive (by self-report).\n18. Have a diagnosis of immunodeficiency, or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy (doses exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent), or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 21 days prior to first dose of study treatment.\n19. Patients who are on treatment for an autoimmune disease, unless specifically approved by the Investigator and the Sponsor.\n20. Patients with severe psychiatric (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar, or borderline personality disorder) or other clinically progressive major medical problems, unless approved by the Investigator and Sponsor.\n21. Patients may not be on a concurrent clinical trial, unless approved by Investigator and Sponsor.",
