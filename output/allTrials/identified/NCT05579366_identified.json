Participants who had 1 to 4 prior lines of therapy are allowed if mirvetuximab soravtansine (MIRV) was the last line of therapy.\n* Participants must have platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.\n* Participants must have received prior bevacizumab.\n* Participants with known or suspected deleterious germline or somatic BRCA mutations (as determined by Food and Drug Administration [FDA]-approved test in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments [CLIA]-certified laboratory) and who achieved a complete or partial response to platinum-based chemotherapy must have been treated with a poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor as maintenance treatment.\n* Participants must have known FRα status based on an FDA approved test. Those who are FRα positive must have previously received MIRV, unless the participant has a documented medical exception.\n* Prior induction plus maintenance is considered 1 line of therapy, even if parts of the treatment regimen (induction or maintenance) are interrupted and/or resumed at a later date, in the absence of disease progression while on active treatment.\n* A switch/change in regimen due solely to toxicity or participant preference (and not disease progression) is not considered a separate line of therapy.\n\nPart D:\n\nCohort D1 (Rina-S+carboplatin):\n\n* Participants must have platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer.\n* Participants must have received 1 to 3 prior lines of therapy.\n\nCohort D2 (Rina-S+bevacizumab):\n\n* Participants must have platinum-refractory, platinum-resistant, or platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer.\n* Participants must have received 1 to 3 prior lines of therapy for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer (PROC), and up to 4 prior lines of therapy for platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer (PSOC). Prior treatments may have included bevacizumab, PARP inhibitor, and MIRV.\n\nCohort D3 (Rina-S+pembrolizumab):\n\n* Endometrial cancer (any subtype excluding sarcoma).\n* Participants must have received prior platinum-based chemotherapy for recurrent or advanced disease.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
