If urine dipstick is ≥ 2+, 24 hour urine must demonstrate ≤ 1 g of protein in 24 hours.\n    * Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) or calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 30 mL/min using the Cockcroft-Gault equation.\n11. Patients must have normal blood pressure (BP) or adequately treated and controlled BP, with a systolic BP of ≤ 140 mmHg and diastolic BP of ≤ 90 mmHg for eligibility.

The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.\n14.
