Willing and able to provide written informed consent for the trial.\n2. 18 years of age on day of signing informed consent.\n3.

Group B: Histiologically-confirmed WHO grade IV glioma (glioblastoma or gliosarcoma) with MET alteration identified through molecular testing.\n\n   1. Patients will be eligible if the original histology was low-grade glioma and a subsequent histiological diagnosis of grade IV glioma is made at some point along the disease trajectory.\n   2. Note: Patients with IDH wildtype grade III anaplastic astrocytoma (1p19q intact) are also elgibile, as these tumors are expected to behave similarly to grade IV glioma.\n   3. At first, second or third recurrence of glioblastoma, and patients must have received prior radiation and/or chemotherapy.\n7. Group C: NSCLC with documented activating mutation of the EGFR receptor including T790M status, and with acquired resistance on previous EGFR-TKI therapy, and MET alteration identified through molecular testing.\n\n   a.

If brain mets progression occurs on osimertinib, patient will be eligible if continues osimertinib.\n8. Phase 1b, Group A: Patients must have NSCLC (confirmed by either histology or cytology) with documented METexon14-skipping mutations identified in primary or brain metastasis tissue and/or in circulating tumor DNA in plasma (liquid biopsy).\n9. Phase 1a, Groups A and B participants must require surgical resection for clinical care.\n\n   1. Phase 1a, Group A: Patient must be surgical candidate for brain metastasis (solitary met, single met > ~ 2 cm (surgeon's discretion), multiple mets but one large met, symptomatic met controlled on steroid, and/or highly radioresistant met), but not require immediate surgery.\n   2.

Phase 1a, Group C and Phase 1b, Groups A and C participants must have small, minimally symptomatic/asymptomatic brain metastasis that do not require surgical resection.\n\n3. Measurable disease\n\na. Groups A and C: Presence of at least 1 independently verified measurable brain metastasis in accordance with a modified RANO-BM (see Section 6.1.6, Tumor Imaging and Assessment of Disease) that can be accurately assessed at baseline with ≥ 5 mm* in the longest diameter with MRI, which is suitable for accurate repeated measurements and that preferably was not previously irradiated or biopsied *and must be surgical candidate b. Group B: Presence of measurable glioblastoma, per RANO criteria, and that can be accurately assessed at baseline with ≥ 5 mm* in the longest diameter with MRI, which is suitable for accurate repeated measurements *and must be surgical candidate\n\n4. Willing to undergo CSF sampling via lumbar puncture. 5. No medical contraindication to lumbar puncture (to include severe coagulopathy, radiographic concern for impending herniation or obstructive hydrocephalus, or soft tissue infection at puncture site, as outlined in MD Anderson institutional policy).\n\n1. Patient may still enroll but LP may be deferred if at any time the treating physician determines that it would be unsafe to perform this procedure due to the characteristics (size, associated edema, etc) of the brain tumor 6. If taking steroids, stable or decreasing dose of steroids for at least 5 days prior to enrollment; no more than 4 mg dexamethasone (or equivalent) total per day for patients with brain metastasis, and no more than 8 mg per day for patients with glioblastoma.\n\n   7.
