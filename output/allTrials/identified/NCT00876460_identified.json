Patients with one prior chemotherapy regimen including platinum-containing drug.\n\n   In case of recurrent disease, one additional prior regimen is allowed for adjuvant and/or neoadjuvant therapy. However monotherapy of EGFR-TKI (i.e. erlotinib/Tarceva® and gefitinib/Iressa®) is not counted as 'one regimen'.\n3. Male or female patients age >=20 years and =<74 years at the enrolment.\n4.

Written informed consent that is consistent with ICH-GCP guidelines.\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\n1. Patients who have received chemotherapy (including other investigational drug), hormonal therapy and immune therapy =<4 weeks prior to registration or who have not recovered from side effects of such therapy.\n2. Patients who have received radiotherapy =<4 weeks (limited field (e.g brain or bone metastasis) radiation =<2 weeks) prior to registration.\n3. Patients who have active brain metastases. (Patients who have no symptoms and is not needed to receive therapy in the registration may participate in this trial)\n4. Patients with active double cancer. (Patients who have skin cancer that is not malignant melanoma and carcinoma in situ of uterine cervix may participate in this trial)\n5. Patients with distinct / suspected pulmonary fibrosis or interstitial lung disease by the chest radiographic findings, or patients with a previous history of.\n6. History of clinically significant haemoptysis within the past 3 months (more than one tea spoon of fresh blood per day)\n7. Therapeutic anticoagulation (except low dose heparin and/or heparin flush as needed for maintenance of an indwelling intravenous device) or antiplatelet therapy (except for chronic low-dose therapy with acetylsalicylic acid =<325 mg per day)\n8. History of major thrombotic or clinically relevant major bleeding event in the past 6 months prior to registration.\n9. Known inherited predisposition to bleeding or thrombosis.\n10.

Patients with difficulty in swallowing study medication\n19. Patients with positive HBs antigen, HCV antibody, or HIV antibody test\n20. Serious illness or concomitant non-oncological disease such as neurologic-, psychiatric-, infectious disease or active ulcers (gastro-intestinal tract, skin) or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with trial participation or investigational drug administration and in the judgment of the investigator would make the patient inappropriate for entry into the trial.\n21. Patients who are sexually active and unwilling to use a medically acceptable method of contraception (e.g. such as implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some intrauterine devices or vasectomized partner for participating females, condoms for participating males) during the trial and for at least 12 months after end of active therapy\n22.
