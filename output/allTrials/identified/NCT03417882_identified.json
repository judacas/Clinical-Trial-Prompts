Have recovered from the effects of any prior radiotherapy or surgery;\n12. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative serum human chorionic gonadotropic (hCG) test within 1 week of Day 1 (pregnancy test not required for subjects with bilateral oophorectomy and/or hysterectomy or for those subjects who are >1 year post-menopausal); and\n13.

Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical cancer.\n5.

Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases NOTE: Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging [using the identical imaging modality for each assessment, either magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computerized tomography (CT) scan] for at least four weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using steroids for at least 7 days prior to study treatment;\n7. Has carcinomatous meningitis;\n8. Has an active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment NOTE: Subjects with vitiligo or resolved childhood asthma/atopy would be an exception to this rule. Subjects that require intermittent use of bronchodilators or local steroid injections would not be excluded from the study;\n9. Has history of interstitial lung disease, or history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids, or current pneumonitis;\n10. Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy NOTE: Antibiotic therapy must have been completed a minimum of 3 days prior to start of study treatment;\n11.

Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the study;\n15. Has received a live virus vaccine within 30 days of the planned first dose of study therapy NOTE: seasonal influenza vaccines for injection which are generally inactivated flu vaccines are permitted; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live attenuated vaccines and are not permitted;\n16. Is pregnant, breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father a child within the projected duration of the study including 120 days following the last dose of study treatment; or\n17.
