Similarly, where there is concern about a patient's bone marrow reserves, for example due to multiple previous lines of myelosuppressive chemotherapy a backup stem cell harvest should also be obtained.\n* Female patients of child-bearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test prior treatment and agree to use appropriate medically approved contraceptive precautions for four weeks prior to entering the trial, during the trial, and for six months afterwards.\n* Male patients must agree to use barrier method contraception during the treatment and for six months afterwards.\n* Able to provide full written informed consent.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
