Willing to follow the treatment protocol and visit schedule, and participate in the study with the ICF signed;\n2. ≥ 18 years of age on the day of ICF signing, regardless of gender.\n3. With ALK-positive advanced inoperable NSCLC and having disease progression or intolerance after continuous treatment with second-generation ALK inhibitors;\n4.

Adequate bone marrow, liver, kidney, coagulation and pancreatic functions;\n10. Expected survival ≥ 3 months;\n11. Willing to take effective contraceptive measures (for men of reproductive potential and women of reproductive age only) from ICF signing to 6 months after administration of the investigational drug. Women of reproductive age include women before menopause and within 2 years after menopause. Those women must have a negative pregnancy test ≤ 7 days prior to the first dose of the investigational drug.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",

Known hypersensitivity to any of the active ingredients or excipients of TGRX-326 or a history of severe allergic reactions that makes himself/herself unsuitable for TGRX-326 treatment in the judgment of the investigator;\n3. Having another type of cancer except for lung cancer;\n4. Major surgery within 4 weeks prior to the first dose;\n5. Spinal cord compression caused by tumor, unless the subject achieves significant pain control and full recovery of neurological function within 4 weeks prior to the first dose.\n6.

History of active pneumonia or clinically significant interstitial pneumonia, or radiation or drug-induced lung disorder with treatment needs;\n8. Cardiac insufficiency;\n9. Abnormal and clinically significant QTc on ECG or need of concomitant use of any drug known to prolong QT interval and cause torsades de pointes;\n10. Uncontrolled hypertension after drug treatment;\n11. Uncontrolled hyperglycaemia, acute attack of cholelithiasis, and susceptibility to acute pancreatitis;\n12. Severe or uncontrolled systemic diseases causing expected intolerance to the investigational drug as judged by the investigator;\n13. Use within 14 days before the first dose or expected concomitant use during the treatment period of drugs that pose risk of QTC interval prolongation and/or ventricular tachycardia;\n14. Previous antineoplastic treatments within 28 days prior to the first dose of the investigational drug;\n15. Toxic reactions associated with prior surgery and prior antineoplastic therapies that have not recovered and may affect the subject safety as assessed by the investigator.\n16. Clinically significant active bacterial, fungal or viral infections, including a positive result for hepatitis B surface antigen and HBV DNA ≥ ULN, one or more positive results for hepatitis C antibody or HIV antibody, or the presence of any uncontrolled infection.\n17. Use of strong CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors or CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic window within two weeks prior to the first dose of the investigational drug;\n18. Pregnant and breastfeeding female;\n19. Women of childbearing age who are unwilling or unable to use acceptable methods for contraception during the entire treatment period in the trial and within 6 months after the last dose of the investigational drug (women of childbearing age include: any one with menarche, and those who have not received successful artificial sterilization [hysterectomy, bilateral fallopian tube ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy] or premenopausal women); a fertile male patient who is unwilling or unable to take effective contraceptive measures, and whose partner is a woman of childbearing age;\n20. Being involved in other clinical studies (except for the non-interventional phase of interventional clinical study, such as survival follow-up period); less than 4 weeks from the end of the dose of other investigational drug to the first dose of the investigational drug or 5 half-lives of the previous drug, whichever is shorter;\n21. Any mental or cognitive disorders which may limit subjects' understanding and implementation of the informed consent form;\n22. Other situations, such as poor compliance, which are considered by the investigator to be not suitable for participation in the study.",
