        "inclusion_criteria": "* PRE-REGISTRATION: Age ≥ 18 years\n* PRE-REGISTRATION: Diagnosis or history of epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, carcinosarcoma, or primary peritoneal cancer\n* PRE-REGISTRATION: Patients must have measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria on study entry, which must include at least 1 lesion that has a single diameter of ≥ 1 cm measured by CT or MRI or the CT portion of the PET/CT\n\n  * Skin lesions can be used if the area is ≥ 1cm in at least one diameter and measured with a ruler\n* PRE-REGISTRATION: Relapsed or refractory ovarian cancer previously treated with or intolerant to at least one prior line of therapy with platinum chemotherapy and be relapsed or have tumor evaluable for response if in first line setting resistant or ineligible to platinum. Patients with BRCA1/2 mutations must have received prior treatment with a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor to be eligible. Platinum-resistance is defined as any of the following occurring < 183 days after the last dose of platinum-based chemotherapy:\n\n  * Development of measurable disease (per RECIST 1.1)\n  * Progression of radiographic disease (per RECIST 1.1)\n  * Increase in CA-125 level to ≥ 2 x upper limit of normal (ULN) (if within normal limits [WNL] at the completion of platinum-based chemotherapy)\n  * Increase in CA-125 level to ≥ 2 x nadir (if nadir > ULN)\n  * If CA-125 is used to determine the date of progression then it must be confirmed by a second CA-125 value ≥ 7 days after the first level and concurrent with imaging changes. The date of the first qualifying CA-125 is used to compute the platinum-free interval\n* PRE-REGISTRATION: Provide written informed consent\n* PRE-REGISTRATION: Willingness to provide mandatory blood specimens and biopsy tissue for correlative research\n* REGISTRATION: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 0 or 1\n* REGISTRATION: Histologically confirmed surgical diagnosis of epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, carcinosarcoma, or primary peritoneal cancer with measurable disease.

        "exclusion_criteria": "* Clinically unresolved central nervous system (CNS) metastases. NOTE: Patients with a prior history of brain metastases are allowed if focally treated, radiographically stable for > 30 days, and not requiring steroid therapy for > 14 days\n* Prior treatment targeting MUC1\n* Subjects with known plasma cell leukemia (PCL)\n* Any of the following are excluded because this study involves an agent (CTX) that has known genotoxic, mutagenic and/or teratogenic effects:\n\n  * Pregnant persons\n  * Nursing persons\n  * Persons of childbearing potential who are unwilling to employ adequate birth control measures\n* History of myocardial infarction ≤ 6 months prior to registration, and/or congestive heart failure requiring ongoing treatment such as medications and/or an implanted defibrillator to control life-threatening arrhythmias\n* Failure to recover to grade 1 or baseline from acute, reversible effects of prior therapy regardless of interval since last treatment. EXCEPTION: Grade 2 peripheral (sensory) neuropathy that has been stable for at least 3 months since completion of prior treatment.\n* Uncontrolled concurrent illness including, but not limited to:\n\n  * Inability to clear an ongoing or active infection\n  * Symptomatic congestive heart failure\n  * Unstable angina pectoris\n  * Uncontrolled psychiatric problems\n  * Inability to have a caregiver for active oversight during treatment period\n  * Dyspnea at rest due to complications of advanced malignancy or other disease that requires continuous oxygen therapy\n  * Any other conditions that the protocol investigators deem could potentially limit compliance with study requirements\n* Evidence of clinical immunocompromise and/or HIV positivity and currently receiving antiretroviral therapy\n* Patients requiring chronic supraphysiologic daily doses of steroids (> 10 mg prednisone or prednisolone, ≥ 4 mg Decadron or ≥ 50 mg hydrocortisol daily)\n* Patients receiving any other investigational agent which could be considered a treatment for the neoplasm\n* Other active malignancy first documented ≤ 4 years prior to registration. EXCEPTIONS: Non-melanotic skin cancer or carcinoma-in-situ of the cervix. NOTE: If there is a history of other malignancy, the patient must not be receiving other treatment aimed at suppressing its recurrence\n* Diagnosis of autoimmune disease\n\n  * Known history of active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the ≤ 30 days (i.e., with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive drugs) prior to pre-registration. NOTE: Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency) is not considered a form of systemic treatment. Patients with vitiligo, Graves' disease, or psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment within the past 30 days are not excluded. Patients with Celiac disease controlled with diet modification are not excluded",
