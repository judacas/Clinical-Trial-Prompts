Complete clinical remission is defined as serum CA-125 within institutional normal limits, negative physical examination, and no definite evidence of disease by computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis. Lymph nodes and/or soft tissue abnormalities ≤ 1.0cm are often present in the pelvis and will not be considered definite evidence of disease. Eligibility is determined by anatomical imaging only (ie. MRI or CT). Positive PET image (if performed) will not exclude a patient if other criteria are met and anatomical imaging is negative.\n* Adequate organ function defined by\n* Bone marrow function: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 1,000/mm³, grade 1. Platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/mm³.\n* Renal function: Serum creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 x institutional upper limit normal (ULN), CTCAE v4.0 grade 1.\n* Hepatic function: Bilirubin, SGOT, and alkaline phosphatase less than or equal to 2.5 x ULN\n* Negative stool hemoccult (or negative endoscopic evaluation if positive). External hemorrhoids are a common source of a positive hemoccult and should not exclude patients.\n* TSH not elevated above normal range\n* KPS > or = to 80%.\n* Patients have signed the informed consent document and signed the authorization permitting release of personal health information.\n* Age > 18 years\n* Patients must have recovered from clinically significant side effects from prior chemotherapy\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust be FEMALE\nMust have minimum age of 19 Years",
        "exclusion_criteria": "* Pregnant or nursing women\n* Patients with other invasive malignancies who had (or have) any evidence of the other cancer present within the last 5 years, or whose previous cancer treatment contraindicated this protocol therapy are excluded. Non-melanoma skin cancers are an exception and will not exclude any patient.\n* Patients with a history of a seafood allergy.\n* Patients who have previously received a vaccine with any of the antigens in the current trial.\n* Patients with a history of immunodeficiency or autoimmune disease (excluding treated hypothyroidism).\n* Patients with active CNS tumor.",
