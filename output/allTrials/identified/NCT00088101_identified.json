All patients in the high-risk group (Stage III and IV) are eligible. Intermediate risk patients (Stage I and II) with one or more criteria of active disease (such as progressive lymphocytosis, lymphadenopathy, and splenomegaly, weight loss > 10% within 6 months, extreme fatigue, fever and/or night sweats without evidence of infection, etc.) are also eligible\n* ECOG Performance Status of 0-2\n* Life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks.\n* Patients must have acceptable organ and marrow function at screening and pre-dose visits as defined below unless approved medically by the clinical investigator.\n* Absolute neutrophils count greater than 1,000 cells/ul for patients with hematologic malignancies and â‰¥1,500 cells/ul for patients with solid tumors\n* Platelets greater than 100,000/ul\n* Hgb greater than 8.5 g/dL\n* Total bilirubin must be <1.5 mg/dL or < 2X upper limit of normal\n* AST (SGOT) < 2.5 times the upper limit of normal\n* ALT (SGPT) < 2.5 times the upper limit of normal\n* Adequate renal function (serum creatinine < 2.0 mg/dL or a calculated creatinine clearance greater than 50 mL/min)\n* Electrocardiogram without evidence of clinically significant conduction abnormalities or active ischemia as determined by the investigator.\n* NCI grade 0-1 left ventricular ejection fraction within 30 days of dosing.\n* The effects of STA-5312 on the developing human fetus are unknown. Therefore, women of childbearing potential (defined as women under 50 years of age or history of amenorrhea for < 12 months prior to study entry) must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a female patient become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform the treating physician immediately.\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
        "exclusion_criteria": "* Women who are pregnant or lactating.\n* Patients who have had chemotherapy, radiotherapy (except palliative radiation delivered to < 20% of bone marrow), immunotherapy, or corticosteroids ( > 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent) within 4 weeks prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.\n* The use of nitrosoureas or mitomycin C within 6 weeks prior to study entry.\n* Patients with prior peripheral blood stem cell rescue or bone marrow transplantation.\n* History of primary brain tumors or active brain metastases. (Patients with previously treated brain metastases who are not receiving corticosteroids or anticonvulsants may be considered for enrollment)\n* History of stroke or other significant neurologic limitations within 6 months prior to study enrollment\n* Use of any investigational agents within 4 weeks of study enrollment.\n* History of severe allergic reactions to excipients (e.g. Tween 80) or had hypersensitivity reactions to other chemotherapeutic agents similar in structure to STA-5312.\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements, as determined by the investigator.\n* History of active CNS-lymphoma, AIDS-related lymphoma, or any uncontrolled severe medical illness or infection.\n* Grade 2 or higher sensory or motor neuropathy at screening.\n* Major surgery (excluding that for diagnosis) within 4 weeks of enrollment.",
