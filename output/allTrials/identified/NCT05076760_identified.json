Progressed following therapy with at least one PD-1 or PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor (regardless of PD-L1 expression status), except for patients with pancreatic cancer.\n\n   a) Prior progression on a PD-1 or PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor should be unequivocal; progression that occurs within the first 8 weeks of treatment on these agents should be confirmed with a second CT at least 4 weeks apart (to exclude pseudo-progression).\n9. Patients with activating EGFR mutation or ALK rearrangement which is expected to be responsive to available tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy, must have been previously treated with an applicable tyrosine kinase inhibitor.\n10. Tumor lesion which is deemed feasible for biopsy and injection under CT or ultrasound guidance (based on size, location, and visibility) by an interventional radiologist, and patient willing and able to provide tissue from biopsy of this lesion.

Patients of childbearing age must not be pregnant and must use established contraceptive strategies:\n\n    1.
