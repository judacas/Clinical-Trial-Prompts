Subject is eligible if he stops dutasteride for a total washout of 90 days prior to the Screening Visit and agrees not to use dutasteride for the duration of the study.\n* Have previously taken finasteride for greater than two years\n* Currently taking finasteride. Subject is eligible if he stops finasteride for a total washout of 30 days prior to the Screening Visit and agrees not to use finasteride for the duration of the study.\n* Currently taking testosterone or testosterone-like supplements, such as dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). Subject is eligible if he stops these agents for a total washout of 30 days prior to the Screening Visit and agrees not to use these agents for the duration of the study.\n* Have a history of taking PC-SPES within the past two years.\n* Currently taking herbal medicine or dietary supplements for prostate health, such as Saw Palmetto (also known as Serenoa Repens).\n\nSubject is eligible if he stops these agents for a total washout of 30 days prior to taking the first dose of study drug and agrees not to use these agents for the duration of the study.\n\nLycopene, vitamin E and selenium are not prohibited and no washout is required.
