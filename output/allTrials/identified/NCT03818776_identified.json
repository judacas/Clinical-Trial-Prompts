Being deemed unresectable can be for any reason, including but not limited to: tumor location, tumor characteristics, operative risks, poor participant lung function, participant age or medical comorbidity.\n* Must be deemed by Medical Oncologist or tumor board decision to not be a candidate for or able to tolerate standard cisplatinum based doublet concurrent chemoradiation therapy or the participant refuses chemotherapy. Being deemed not a chemotherapy candidate can be for any reason, including but not limited to: age, medical comorbidity, end organ dysfunction.\n* Pulmonary function testing performed within 365 days prior to registration. .

Participants with a past or resolved hepatitis B (HBV) infection (defined as the presence of hepatitis B core antibody [anti-HBc] and absence of HBsAg) are eligible. Participants positive for hepatitis C (HCV) antibody are eligible only if polymerase chain reaction is negative for HCV RNA.\n* Receipt of live attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of IP. Note: Participants, if enrolled, should not receive live vaccine whilst receiving IP and up to 30 days after the last dose of IP.\n* Prior randomisation or treatment in a previous durvalumab and/or tremelimumab clinical study regardless of treatment arm assignment.",
