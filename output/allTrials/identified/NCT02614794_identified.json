If the adverse event leading to discontinuation of study treatment has resolved, the patient may be allowed to crossover with approval from the medical monitor.\n* History of exposure to the following cumulative doses of anthracyclines:\n\n  * Doxorubicin > 360 mg/m^2\n  * Epirubicin > 720 mg/m^2\n  * Mitoxantrone > 120 mg/m^2\n  * Idarubicin > 90 mg/m^2\n  * Liposomal doxorubicin > 550 mg/m^2\n* History of allergic reactions to trastuzumab, capecitabine, or compounds chemically or biologically similar to tucatinib\n\n  o Exceptions for Grade 1 or 2 infusion related reactions to trastuzumab that were successfully managed, or known allergy to one of the excipients in the study drugs\n* Have received treatment with any systemic anti-cancer therapy, non-CNS radiation, or experimental agent within 3 weeks prior to start of crossover therapy\n* Any toxicity related to prior cancer therapies that has not resolved to ≤ Grade 1, with the following exceptions:\n\n  * Alopecia and neuropathy (must have resolved to ≤ Grade 2)\n  * CHF (must have been ≤ Grade 1 in severity at the time of occurrence and must have resolved completely)\n  * Anemia (must have resolved to ≤ Grade 2)\n* Have clinically significant cardiopulmonary disease\n* Have known myocardial infarction or unstable angina within 6 months prior to start of crossover therapy\n* Require therapy with warfarin or other coumarin derivatives\n* Inability to swallow pills or significant gastrointestinal disease which would preclude the adequate oral absorption of medications\n* Have used a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor within 5 half-lives of the inhibitor or have used a strong CYP2C8 or CYP34A inducer within 5 days prior to start of the crossover (tucatinib) treatment.\n* Known dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency\n* Unable to undergo contract MRI of the brain\n* Have evidence within 2 years prior to start of crossover therapy of another malignancy that required systemic treatment\n* CNS Exclusion:\n* CNS Exclusion - Based on screening brain MRI, patients must not have any of the following:\n\n  * Any untreated brain lesions > 2.0 cm in size, unless approved by medical monitor\n  * Ongoing use of systemic corticosteroids for control of symptoms of brain metastases at a total daily dose of > 2 mg of dexamethasone (or equivalent)\n  * Any brain lesion thought to require immediate local therapy.
