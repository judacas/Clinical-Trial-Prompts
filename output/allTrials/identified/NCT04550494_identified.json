If avoidable, the lesion for biopsy should not be selected as a target lesion for RECIST measurements\n* The effects of talazoparib on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because PARP inhibitors are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential must agree to use a highly effective method of contraception for the duration of study participation and for at least 7 months after completing study treatment. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.

The time and treatment between the prior PARP inhibitor and protocol initiation must be documented\n* All patients with prostate cancer can continue to receive treatment with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists while on study, as long as there is evidence of disease progression on prior therapy\n* Patients with castration resistant prostate cancer must have castrate levels of testosterone (< 50 ng/dL [1.74 nmol/L])\n* Patients with metastatic hormone receptor (HR) prostate cancer and mutations in either BRCA1, BRCA2, or ATM should continue to receive anti-androgen receptor (anti-AR) therapy\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",

Patients with treated brain metastases, whose brain metastatic disease has remained stable for >= 1 month without requiring steroid and anti-seizure medication are eligible to participate\n* Eligibility of subjects receiving any medications or substances with the potential to affect the activity or pharmacokinetics of talazoparib will be determined following review by the principal investigator\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the effects of the study drugs on the developing fetus are unknown\n* Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients on effective anti-retroviral therapy with undetectable viral load within 6 months are eligible for this trial\n* Patients who require use of coumarin-derivative anticoagulants such as warfarin are excluded.
