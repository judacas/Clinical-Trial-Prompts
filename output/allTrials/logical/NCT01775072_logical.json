        "exclusion_criteria": "All Parts:\n\n* Unwilling or unable to provide informed consent.\n\nPart C:\n\n* All patients consenting to Part A are eligible to consent to 12-245, Part C. Most patients will be eligible to receive clinical germline testing with return of results to the patient/health care providers. However, several exclusion criteria apply and are outlined below\n\n  1. Solid tumor patients: Secondary germline analysis using BAM files generated for MSK-IMPACT testing is not an option for patients with solid tumors and an acute or chronic hematologic neoplasm that would preclude the use of blood or saliva as a source of germline DNA. Such patient may be eligible for primary germline testing using a non-blood source of germline DNA as per standard clinical guidelines. Solid tumor patients who have had an allogenic bone marrow/stem cell transplant will only be considered eligible for germline testing under Part C if a sample adequate for germline testing had previously been collected prior to allogenic bone marrow/stem cell transplant.\n  2. Hematologic cancer patients: For patients with a hematopoietic neoplasm, germline testing may be an option under Part C using nail clippings or another non-blood source of DNA as per standard clinical practice. For patients who have had an allogenic bone marrow/stem cell transplant, clinical germline testing will only be considered under Part C if a sample adequate for germline testing had previously been collected prior to Allogenic bone marrow/stem cell transplant.\n\nPart D\n\n* Exclusion criteria are same as those for Part C outlined above.",
