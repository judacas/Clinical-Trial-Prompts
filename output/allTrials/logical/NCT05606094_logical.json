Trastuzumab or its biosimilar use is not required.\n\n  °Progression on or within 6 months post neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy is counted as \"rapid progressor\" in a neo-adjuvant/adjuvant setting, and thus equivalent to advanced/metastatic disease failing 1 LOT.\n* Participants who have at least 6 months of follow-up data from the date of 2nd LOT initiation (Index Date 2f) unless participant died within the first 6 months from the Index Date 2, and its record is available at the study participating site.\n\n  * For rapid progressor participants in a neo-adjuvant/adjuvant setting, \"Index Date 1\" will be the date of neo-adjuvant treatment initiation or adjuvant treatment initiation.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
