Non clinically significant laboratory abnormalities are not exclusionary.\n* Participant has a known additional malignancy that progressed or required active treatment within the past 2 years. Exceptions include adequately treated superficial skin cancers, superficial bladder cancers, and other in situ cancers.\n* Participant has an active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e., with use of disease-modifying agents, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency) is not considered a form of systemic treatment.\n* Participant has a history of severe allergic and/or anaphylactic reactions to chimeric, human or humanized antibodies, fusion proteins, or has known allergies to dostarlimab or its excipients.\n* Has received or plans to receive an organ or stem cell transplant that uses donor stem cells (allogeneic stem cell transplant).",
