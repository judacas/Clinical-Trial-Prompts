Subjects must be >/= 18 years of age at time of informed consent, regardless of gender\n3. Patients who have been confirmed by pathology to have pancreatic malignant tumors and have undergone radical surgery for pancreatic malignant tumors for 1-3 months\n4. No copy number variations (CNVs) or loss of heterozygosity (Loss-of heterozygosity, LOH) were found in HLA-related genes and chromosomal regions by gene sequencing\n5. Having tumor tissue confirmed by immunohistochemistry, capable of performing WES and RNAseq sequencing, and predicted by bioinformatics analysis, it was found that there is at least one antigen in the table that has been effectively presented by self-HLA, such as KRAS or TP53 mutations and corresponding HLA subtypes\n6. According to the investigator's assessment, the patient is unable to tolerate chemotherapy, such as the score of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Scale ≥ 2 points\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",

Has had chemotherapy, hormone therapy, traditional Chinese medicine, or biological cancer(for mitomycin and nitrosoureas within 6 weeks from the first dose of the drug in this study)， prior to the first dose of study therapytherapy within 4 weeks ,Or within 5 half-lives of immunotherapy, molecular targeted therapy\n2. History of interstitial lung disease (ILD), pulmonary fibrosis\n3. Other serious and/or uncontrollable diseases, which may affect the subject's participation in this study, include but not limited to a) a history of severe drug allergy, or is known to be allergic to any tumor vaccine and pembrolizumab formulation components or has had severe allergic reactions to other monoclonal antibodies in the past, b) A history of immunodeficiency, including HIV positive or other acquired or congenital immunodeficiency diseases\n4.
