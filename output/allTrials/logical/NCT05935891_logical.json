        "inclusion_criteria": "* Age 18 years or above at the time of signing the informed consent form.\n* Histologically proven diagnosis of stage I-III invasive breast cancer.\n* Currently taking prescribed dose of an aromatase inhibitor (e.g., anastrazole, letrozole, exemestane) for at least 60 days with a plan to continue for at least 4 weeks after time of consent.\n* Initiated AI therapy must have been within 48 months at time of consent.\n* Experiencing AIMSS in hands and/or wrists for at least 4 weeks prior to time of consent.\n* Patients must have reported a score of 4 or higher on at least one of the four M-SACRAH questions regarding pain and stiffness in hands and/or wrists over the past 7 days. Patients experiencing AIMSS symptoms in other joints are eligible, but must have pain in hands and/or wrists.\n* Must be willing and able to comply with study visits and procedures.\n* Must be willing to be registered in the Minnesota Medical Cannabis Program (MMCP).\n* Must meet qualifications for the Minnesota Medical Cannabis\n\nProgram (MMCP). This includes:\n\n1. Must have a qualifying condition, as per MMCP requirements, that is certified by a Health Care Practitioner.\n2. Must be a Minnesota resident.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
        "exclusion_criteria": "* The patient is currently using or has used cannabinoids within 4 weeks of time of consent.\n* Active skin lesions on hands/wrists that the investigator feels could impair absorption of cannabinoid cream or lead to increased toxicity (e.g., psoriasis, cellulitis, cutaneous lupus erythematosus, hand-foot syndrome).\n* Plan to start or increase doses of other analgesics aimed at improving AIMSS symptoms (e.g., duloxetine, non-steroidal anti- inflammatories, acetaminophen, opioids). Of note, patients are eligible if they have remained on stable doses of AIMSS related medications for 4 weeks prior to time of consent and do not plan to escalate the dose.\n* Current or planned initiation of acupuncture to arms, wrists or hands within study period.\n* Any known or suspected hypersensitivity to topical cannabinoids.\n* Any condition that the investigator believes would interfere with the ability to provide informed consent, comply with the study protocol, or would put the subject at undue risk.",
