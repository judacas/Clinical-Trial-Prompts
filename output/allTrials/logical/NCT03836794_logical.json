This study is a small qualitative study based upon interviews conducted by a single researcher in the English language. The analysis of the data will depend upon specific words and utterances which are used by the participant. Meaning will be derived from words, phrases, and utterances and will be reliant upon the participant being able to communicate in the English language.",

Meaning will be derived from words, phrases, and utterances and will be reliant upon the participant being able to communicate in the English language.",
