Subjects who were not candidates for surgery, systemic chemotherapy, chemoembolization (TACE), intratumoral ethanol injection (PEI), radiofrequency ablation (RFA), cryoablation or other locally ablative technology may be eligible, but at least 4 weeks must have elapsed since the completion of any prior therapy and the subject must have recovered from acute side effects;\n* Understanding and ability to sign written informed consent;\n* 18 years of age or more;\n* Adequate hematologic, liver and renal functions as evidenced by the following: *WBC > 2,400/mm; *Platelet Count > 75,000/µl; *Hemoglobin > 9.4 gm/dL; *PT and PTT < 1.5 Control; *AST, ALT < 5 x ULN; *Bilirubin < 1.5 X ULN; *Alk Phos < 3X ULN; *Creatinine < 2.5 mg/dL (SI: 221 mmol/L)\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",
