Occasional use of NSAIDs and antiplatelet agents such as aspirin, clopidogrel, aggrenox and dipyridamole are not considered exclusionary if taken <7 days per 28 days. However, if the patient requires chronic use (>/=7 days out of 28 days) of full doses of aspirin or NSAIDs then the patient is excluded. Concomitant antiplatelet agents and NSAIDs should be used with caution Requirement for chronic use of full dose aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Poorly controlled hypertension (defined as requiring changes in any hypertensive regimen within 1 week three months of study entry) or patients diagnosed with hypertension based on repeat blood pressure measurements of >160/90 mmHg at Screening >1+ proteinuria on urine dipstick testing or 30 mg/dL A history of gastrointestinal malabsorption or having undergone surgery requiring gastrointestinal anastomoses within four weeks of starting therapy or who have not recovered from major surgery within three weeks of starting therapy History of alcoholism, drug addiction, or any psychiatric or psychological condition which, in the opinion of the Investigator, would impair study compliance Any treatment with investigational drugs within 30 days before the start of the study Previous treatment with E7080 Known intolerance to temozolomide (or any of the excipients) Women who are pregnant or breast-feeding; women of childbearing potential with a positive pregnancy test at Screening or no pregnancy test. Women of childbearing potential unless (1) surgically sterile or (2) using adequate measures of contraception (including two forms of contraception, one of which must be a barrier method) in the opinion of the Investigator (revised per Amendment 04). Perimenopausal women must be amenorrheic for at least 12 months to be considered of non-childbearing potential Fertile males with female partners who are not willing to use contraception or whose female partners are not using adequate contraceptive protection Legal incapacity",
