Patients with a history of CNS metastases or cord compression are eligible if they have been definitively treated with local therapy (eg, radiotherapy, stereotactic surgery) and are clinically stable off anticonvulsants and steroids for at least 4 weeks before randomization.\n* Progressive disease within 3 months after completion of curatively intended treatment for locoregionally advanced SCCHN.\n* Difficulty swallowing capsules.\n* Prior use of cetuximab in the R/M disease treatment setting (except cetuximab during curative radiotherapy)",
