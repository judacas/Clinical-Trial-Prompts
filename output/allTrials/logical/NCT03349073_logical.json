Patients with advanced malignancy who are receiving T-1101 (Tosylate) in a previous Taivex Therapeutics Corp. sponsored study that has reached its endpoint, and who are, in the opinion of the investigator and/or sponsor, expected to continue to have an overall positive benefit/risk from continuing treatment.\n2. Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation, including the 30 days period after last study drug dosing.\n3. Women of childbearing potential who have a negative pregnancy test within 7 days of the first dose of T-1101 (Tosylate) in this long term extension trial.\n4. Patients who have completed the End of Study assessments in their originating study. Every effort should be made to conduct the End of Study visit such that the patient does not have any interruption in T-1101 (Tosylate) dosing.\n5. Signed and dated informed consent document indicating that the patient has been informed of all the pertinent aspects of the trial prior to enrollment.\n6. Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plans, laboratory tests, and other study procedures.\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 20 Years",
        "exclusion_criteria": "1. Any medical condition that, in the opinion of the investigator and/or sponsor, could jeopardize the safety of the patient.\n2. Hypertension that cannot be controlled by medications (>150/100 mmHg despite optimal medical therapy).\n3. Progressive or untreated metastatic brain or meningeal tumors.\n4. Pregnancy or breastfeeding. Male patients must be surgically sterile or must agree to use effective contraception during the period of therapy. Female patients must be surgically sterile or be postmenopausal, or must agree to the use of highly effective contraception during the period of therapy. Highly effective method of birth control is defined as one that results in a low failure rate (i.e. less than 1 percent per year) when used consistently and correctly, such as implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, intra-uterine devices (IUDs), sexual abstinence, or a vasectomized partner.\n5. Substance abuse, psychological or social conditions that may interfere with the patient's participation in the study or evaluation of the study results.",
