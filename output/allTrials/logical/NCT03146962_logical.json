The effect of Vitamin C on HIV medications is unknown. Note: HIV testing is not required for eligibility, but if performed previously and was positive, the patient is ineligible for the study.\n* Patient who are receiving drugs which are known to interact with Vitamin C, potential risk and eligibility will be evaluated individually by the investigator. a. Most of the known interactions with vitamin C are from oral use and acidification of the stomach lining. There are few known interactions with high dose intravenous vitamin C. We recommend not using deferoxamine as there may be an association with ventricular dysfunction (unknown mechanism).\n* Patients who have uncontrolled or severe hyponatremia, hypernatremia, SIADH, hypokalemia, hyperkalemia, hypomagnesemia, or hypermagnesemia\n* Patients who have uncontrolled or severe coagulopathies or a history of clinically significant bleeding within the past 6 months, such as hemoptysis, epistaxis, hematochezia, hematuria, or gastrointestinal bleeding.\n* Patients who require therapeutic doses of warfarin\n* Patients who have uncontrolled seizure disorder, ascites, iron overload, edema, or dehydration.\n* Patients who have glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, hereditary spherocytosis, or other conditions predisposing patient to hemolysis.\n* Patients who have a known history of recurrent oxalate renal calculi or multiple oxalate.",
        "miscellaneous_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria\n\n* Male or female ≥ 18 years of age.\n* Patients with histologically proven early stage or locally advanced colorectal adenocarcinoma, lung cancer or pancreatic cancer, who are eligible for resection (cohort A).\n* Patients with inoperable, metastatic extended RAS (e.g. KRAS or NRAS) or BRAF mutant colorectal adenocarcinoma, lung cancer and pancreatic cancer, or other solid tumor, who have received at least 1 line of treatment for metastatic disease (cohort B).\n* Patients with metastatic cancer with an extended RAS (e.g. KRAS or NRAS) or BRAF mutation with liver metastases amenable to Y90 radioembolization (cohort C).\n* ECOG performance status 0-1.\n* Life expectancy of at least 6 months.\n* All women of child-bearing potential and all sexually active male patients must agree to use effective contraception."
