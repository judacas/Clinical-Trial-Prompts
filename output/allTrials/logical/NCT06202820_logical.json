        "exclusion_criteria": "* History of major adverse cardiac event, including myocardial infarction, new congestive heart failure (CHF) or CHF exacerbation, or stroke, within the past 24 weeks due to complicated comorbidities that necessitate close collaboration between the participant and their cardiologist.\n* Participants who have already been on ADT therapy for more than 12 weeks are ineligible due to their treatment cycle being incompatible with the quality improvement initiative's trial design. ADT therapy is defined as either a GnRH agonist or antagonist.\n* Participants receiving combination treatment with ADT and chemotherapy (docetaxel, cabazitaxel, carboplatin), radioligand therapy (radium-223, 177PSMA-lutetium-617), or treatment on a clinical trial are not eligible due to potential for more intensive symptom management that may be required for optimal support of their cancer-directed treatment.\n* Participants actively included in therapeutic clinical trials are not eligible due to their greater time constraints.",
