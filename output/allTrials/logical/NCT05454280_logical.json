Restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to carry out work of a light or sedentary nature, e.g., light house work, office work\n2. Ambulatory and capable of all self-care but unable to carry out any work activities. Up and about more than 50% of waking hours\n\n   * Patients must have probable (i.e., clinically suspicious) or histologically/cytologically confirmed, primary or recurrent, malignant neoplasm, malignant neuroendocrine tumor, or carcinoma in situ (any stage).\n\nPatients undergoing major operations to resect or treat known or suspected malignancies of the head and neck, chest, abdomen, genitourinary tract, or extremities are eligible. Patients undergoing biopsies, outpatient procedures, superficial resections of cutaneous malignancies, or purely palliative operations are not eligible.\n\nThese procedures are commonly performed in patients with malignant neoplasms, malignant neuroendocrine tumors, or carcinomas in situ, and are commonly \"tracked\" by hospitals and cancer centers participating in the ACS NSQIP Procedure Targeted option because they are often associated with higher rates of postoperative morbidity and mortality (compared to other, less complex cancer procedures).\n\n* Patient must be scheduled for elective major cancer surgery (as listed in 4.1.4) at FCCC < 30 days after First Registration.\n\nElective surgery is defined as:\n\n* Patient is scheduled to be brought from their home (or normal living environment) to FCCC on the day of the index surgery (or day prior as scheduled admission) AND\n* Surgery is not scheduled as urgent or emergent\n\n  * Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent and HIPAA consent document\n  * Geographical accessibility and willingness to return to FCCC for all preoperative and postoperative study assessments.\n\nFirst Registration\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",

No exceptions or waivers will be granted for patients who do not meet the eligibility criteria.\n\n* Post\n\n  * Elective (curative or palliative) major cancer surgery (as listed in 4.1.4 above) at the time of the index surgery (patient may have undergone more than one of these procedures) OR\n  * Elective surgical procedure(s) listed as an option (i.e., CPT code) in the Surgical Risk Calculator webpage (patient may have undergone more than one of these procedures)\n\nFor the purposes of this study, the procedure that was performed with the highest estimated risk of DSC (as predicted by the Surgical Risk Calculator) will be denoted at the time of Second Registration as the \"index procedure\" performed during the \"index surgery\".\n\n* Elective surgery < 30 days after First Registration.\n\nSecond Registration Exclusion Criteria:\n\n* Status post elective surgical procedure(s) not listed as options in the Surgical Risk Calculator webpage. This includes patients whose scheduled procedure was suspended due to unexpected findings, such as carcinomatosis.",
