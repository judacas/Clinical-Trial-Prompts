Investigators shall advise on the use of highly effective methods of contraception which have a failure rate of </= 1% when used consistently and correctly. Azoospermic males are exempt from contraceptive requirements.\n* WOCBP must agree to follow instructions for method(s) of contraception for the duration of treatment with study drug(s) plus 5 half-lives of study drug (half-life up to 25 days) plus 30 days (duration of ovulatory cycle) for a total of 5 months post-treatment completion.\n* WOCBP who are continuously not heterosexually active are exempt from contraception requirements. However, they must still undergo pregnancy testing as described in this section.\n* Males who are sexually active with WOCBP must agree to follow instructions for method(s) of contraception for the duration of treatment with study drug (s) plus 5 half-lives of the study drug (half-life up to 25 days) plus 90 days (duration of sperm turnover) for a total of 7 months post-treatment completion\nHealthy volunteers allowed\nMust have minimum age of 18 Years",

Patients with an autoimmune paraneoplastic syndrome requiring concurrent immunosuppressive treatment are excluded. Patients with type I diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism only requiring hormone replacement, skin disorders (such as vitiligo, psoriasis, or alopecia) not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger are permitted to enroll\n* A condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (> 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study initiation. Corticosteroids with minimal systemic absorption (inhaled or topical steroids) and adrenal replacement steroid doses > 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease\n* Prior therapy with anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CD137, or anti-CTLA-4 antibody\n* Interstitial lung disease that is symptomatic or may interfere with the detection or management of suspected drug-related pulmonary toxicity.\n* Any patient requiring supplemental oxygen therapy.\n* Previous malignancies (except non-melanoma skin cancers, and some in situ cancers) unless a complete remission was achieved at least 2 years prior to study entry AND no additional therapy is required during the study period.\n* Known medical condition that, in the investigator's opinion, would increase the risk associated with study participation or study drug(s) administration or interfere with the interpretation of safety results\n* Major surgery or significant traumatic injury that is not recovered at least 14 days before the initiation of thoracic radiation therapy.\n* Positive test for hepatitis B virus (HBV) using HBV surface antigen (HBVsAg) test or positive test for hepatitis C virus (HCV) using HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) or HCV antibody test indicating acute or chronic infection.
