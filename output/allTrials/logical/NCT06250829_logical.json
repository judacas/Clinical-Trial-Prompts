Subjects with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (10 mg daily prednisone or equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study drug administration. Inhaled or topical steroids are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease.\n\n  5. Subjects with previous malignancies are excluded unless a complete remission was achieved at least 5 years prior to study entry and no additional therapy is required or anticipated to be required during the study (non-melanoma skin cancer and other indolent malignancies not requiring any treatment and that are unlikely to affect blood-based biomarkers are allowed).",
