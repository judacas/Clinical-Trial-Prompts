Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression, defined as 25% increase over baseline value with an increase in the absolute value of at least 2 ng/mL that is confirmed by another PSA level with a minimum of a 1 week interval with a minimum PSA of 2 ng/mL.\n   2. Progression of bi-dimensionally measurable soft tissue (nodal metastasis) assessed within 1 month prior to registration by computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen and pelvis.\n   3. Progression of bone disease (evaluable disease) (new bone lesion[s]) by bone scan.\n2. Has discontinued antiandrogens (bicalutamide, nilutamide) >6 weeks and enzalutamide >4 weeks prior to Day 1 of trial treatment\n3.

Received more than 3 prior systemic treatment regimens with chemotherapy, hormonal, or immunotherapy in the metastatic setting or received more than 1 prior chemotherapeutic regimen in the metastatic setting\n2. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving any systemic steroid therapy or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to Day 1 of trial treatment. The use of physiologic doses of corticosteroids may be approved after consultation with the Sponsor.\n3. Has had a prior monoclonal antibody within 4 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., Grade ≤1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.\n4. Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy within 2 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., Grade ≤1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to a previously administered agent.\n5. Has received prior therapy with an anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1), anti-programmed death-ligand-1 (PD-L1), or anti-Programmed death-ligand-2 (PD-L2) agent or if the participant has previously participated in a Merck MK-3475 clinical trial.\n6. Has a contraindication to administration of ampicillin or trimethoprim/ sulfamethoxazole.\n7. Has implanted medical device(s) that pose a high risk for colonization and/or cannot be easily removed (e.g., prosthetic joints, artificial heart valves, pacemakers, orthopedic screw(s), metal plate(s), bone graft(s), or other exogenous implant(s)). NOTE: More common devices and prosthetics which include arterial and venous stents, dental and breast implants, and venous access devices (e.g., Port-a-Cath or Mediport) are permitted.
