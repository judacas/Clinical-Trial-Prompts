Reprocess trials? (y/n): n

Hello! Before we proceed, I'd like to ensure we cover all necessary details. Could you confirm if you have a diagnosis of a malignancy that has been confirmed through a biopsy or tissue examination (histological confirmation)?

no I don't

I see. Can you tell me if your current life expectancy is at least 168 days, or 6 months, as estimated by your healthcare provider? Additionally, can you let me know if you have information on your Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status?

yes it is

Thank you for confirming your life expectancy. Regarding the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, it helps to determine how your disease is affecting your daily living abilities. An ECOG performance status of 0 means you are fully active, able to carry on all pre-disease performance without restriction. A status of 1 indicates you are restricted in physically strenuous activity but are ambulatory and able to carry out work of a light or sedentary nature, such as light house work or office work. Could you please share your ECOG performance status with me?

I can move around perfeclty and fully active

That's great to hear. So your ECOG performance status would be 0.

Moving on, could you provide information on your Body Mass Index (BMI)? BMI is calculated by dividing your weight in kilograms by the square of your height in meters. If you're not sure how to calculate this, please share your height and weight, and I can calculate it for you.

Also, have you experienced any weight loss exceeding 5% of your body weight in the last 168 days (roughly 6 months)?        

only 3%

Thank you for sharing that information. It would be helpful to know your current weight and height to calculate your BMI and ensure it's above 21 kg/m^2. Could you please provide your weight in kilograms and height in meters?

my bmi is 52

Thank you for sharing your BMI, which is well above the threshold of 21 kg/m^2.

Moving forward, do you have adequate renal function? Adequate renal function typically means your kidneys are working well and effectively filtering waste from your blood. This is usually assessed through blood tests measuring serum creatinine, estimating your glomerular filtration rate (GFR), or other kidney function tests. Have you had any recent tests or evaluations with your healthcare provider confirming this?

I have not had any tests

Alright. It's important for those tests to be performed to confirm adequate renal function, especially if you're considering any medical study or treatment that requires it.

Next, for women of childbearing potential, a negative pregnancy test within 7 days prior to registration is necessary. Does this apply to you, and if so, have you had such a test?

Also, have you provided informed consent for any treatment or study you might be participating in?

And do you have the ability to complete the patient booklet by yourself or with assistance? This could include understanding the material and filling out forms or questionnaires.

yes I consent to everything I am not pregnant and I can fill everything out myself      
getting AI response

Great, thank you for confirming that you provide informed consent, are not pregnant, and have the capability to complete the patient booklet on your own.

Can you tell me if you have the ability and willingness to undergo a fast for at least 24 hours prior to chemotherapy?

Additionally, are you willing to be treated at Mayo Clinic Rochester and be available for follow-up?

Also, would you be willing to provide blood samples for correlative research purposes?  

Lastly, just for clarification, is your age 18 years or older?

I am 15
