Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as ipilimumab and nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Colony-stimulating factors, such as sargramostim, may increase the production of white blood cells. It is not yet known whether nivolumab and ipilimumab are more effective with or without sargramostim in treating patients with melanoma.", "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To compare the overall survival (OS) of nivolumab/ipilimumab/sargramostim (GM-CSF) versus nivolumab/ipilimumab.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate progression free survival (PFS) of patients treated with nivolumab/ipilimumab/GM-CSF versus nivolumab/ipilimumab.\n\nII. To assess for differences in tolerability, specifically the rate of grade III or higher adverse events, between nivolumab/ipilimumab/GM-CSF versus nivolumab/ipilimumab.\n\nIII. To evaluate immune-related response rate (based on immune-related response criteria) and response rate (based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors \\[RECIST\\] criteria) and to compare them.\n\nEXPLORATORY TOBACCO USE OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the effects of tobacco, operationalized as combustible tobacco (1a), other forms of tobacco (1b), and environmental tobacco exposure (ETS) (1c) on provider-reported cancer-treatment toxicity (adverse events \\[both clinical and hematologic\\] and dose modifications).\n\nII. To determine the effects of tobacco on patient-reported physical symptoms and psychological symptoms.\n\nIII. To examine quitting behaviors and behavioral counseling/support and cessation medication utilization.\n\nIV. To explore the effect of tobacco use and exposure on treatment duration, relative dose intensity, and therapeutic benefit.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\nARM A: INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1, ipilimumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1, and sargramostim subcutaneously (SC) on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nMAINTENANCE THERAPY: Patients receive nivolumab and sargramostim as in induction therapy. Patients with partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), or complete response (CR) at 24 weeks may continue maintenance therapy for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) scan, tumor biopsy and blood sample collection throughout the study.\n\nARM B: INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients receive nivolumab and ipilimumab as in Arm I. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nMAINTENANCE THERAPY: Patients receive nivolumab as in induction therapy. Patients with PR, SD, or CR at 24 weeks may continue maintenance therapy for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo MRI, CT scan, tumor biopsy and blood sample collection throughout the study.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years."}, "eligibilityModule": {"eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* All patients must be \\>= 18 years of age\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status: 0 or 1\n* Patients must have known BRAF mutational status of tumor; wild-type (WT) or mutated, prior to randomization\n* Patients must have unresectable stage III or stage IV melanoma according to American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) version (v)7; patients must have histological or cytological confirmation of melanoma that is metastatic or unresectable and clearly progressive\n* Patients must have measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 criteria; all sites of disease must be evaluated within 4 weeks prior to randomization\n* Patients may have had prior systemic therapy in the adjuvant setting (e.g. interferon, BRAF, or MEK agents).
