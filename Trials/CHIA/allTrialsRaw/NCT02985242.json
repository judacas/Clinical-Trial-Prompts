    "exclusionCriteria": "1. Type 1 diabetes\n2. uncontrolled diabetes mellitus type 2 with fasting glucose \\> 13.3 mmol/l confirmed on a second day\n3. known or suspected hypersensitivity to empagliflozin, glimepiride, or any excipients; and / or known or suspected hypersensitivity to sulfonylureas, sulfonamides or SGLT2 inhibitors in general\n4. history of multiple severe hypoglycemic episodes within the last two years\n5. use of Insulin, SGLT2-inhibitor, sulfonylurea derivate or a glinide within past 3 months\n6. clinical significant macular edema in both eyes and indication for intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment for both eyes at screening or baseline visit. Eyes with a small amount of intraretinal or subretinal fluid (seen in OCT) but no need for intravitreal treatment as judged by the investigator (according to current practice patterns) may be included. Eyes with a history of intravitreal treatment of macular edema which do not need ongoing intravitreal treatment at the time of screening may be included.\n7. eye diseases or pathologies that prevent clear ophthalmoscopy and evaluation of study parameters, thus not allowing study participation according to the investigator\u00b4s judgment, such as (but not only) vitreous hemorrhage, mature cataract, macular pathologies other than diabetic maculopathy\n8. history of ketoacidosis or metabolic acidosis\n9. use of loop diuretics\n10. history of \\> 1 urogenital infection/year\n11. any history of stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), instable angina pectoris or myocardial infarction within last 3 months prior to baseline visit\n12. congestive heart failure New York Heart Association (NYHA) III and IV\n13. severe valvular or left ventricular outflow obstruction disease needing intervention;\n14. atrial fibrillation/flutter with a mean ventricular response rate at rest \\>100 beats per minute\n15. chronic lower urinary tract infections (but not simple asymptomatic bacteriuria)\n16. eGFR \\< 60 ml/min/1,73 m2 (MDRD-formula, confirmed on a second day)\n17. chronic diarrhea, any clinical signs of volume depletion or a hematocrit \\> 48 % (women) and \\> 53 % (men)\n18. elevated risk for volume depletion, e.g. history of severe volume depletion that required medical therapy\n19. chronic liver disease (including known active hepatitis) and/or screening alanine transaminase (ALT) or aspartate transaminase (AST) \\> 3 x upper limit of normal (ULN) (confirmed on a second day)\n20. Subjects with known seropositivity to human immunodeficiency virus.\n21. acute illness at screening or randomization according to judgement by the investigator or patient\n22. drug or alcohol abuse\n23. psychosomatic or psychiatric diseases requiring hospitalization during the last 12 months\n24. clinical evidence of current malignancy with exception of basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (5 years prior to randomization)\n25. any medical or surgical intervention planned for the next 13 months after randomization not allowing study participation according to the investigator\u00b4s judgment\n26. current participation in any other clinical trial or participation in another clinical trial within 30 days before screening"
