    "officialTitle": "An Open-label, Randomized, Five-way, Cross-over Study to Compare the Efficacy of Single- and Dual-hormone Closed-loop Operations Combined With Either Conventional Carbohydrate Counting or a Simplified Qualitative Meal-size Estimation, and Sensor-augmented Pump Therapy in Regulating Glucose Levels in Adults With Type 1 Diabetes",
    "inclusionCriteria": "1. Males and females \u2265 18 years old.\n2. Clinical diagnosis of type 1 diabetes for at least one year.\n3. The subject will have been on insulin pump therapy for at least 3 months and currently using a fast actin insulin analog (Lispro, Aspart or Guilisine).\n4. Last (less than 3 months) HbA1c \u2264 10%.\n5. Currently using carbohydrate counting as the meal insulin dose strategy.\n* Must have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusionCriteria": "1. Clinically significant microvascular complications: nephropathy (estimated glomerular filtration rate below 40 ml/min), neuropathy (especially diagnosed gastroparesis) or severe proliferative retinopathy as judged by the investigator.\n2. Recent (\\< 3 months) acute macrovascular event e.g. acute coronary syndrome or cardiac surgery.\n3. Ongoing pregnancy.\n4. Severe hypoglycemic episode within 1 month of screening.\n5. Agents affecting gastric emptying (Motilium\u00ae, Prandase\u00ae, Victoza\u00ae, Byetta\u00ae and Symlin\u00ae) as well as oral anti-diabetic agents (Metformin, SGLT-2 inhibitors and DPP-4 inhibitors) if not at a stable dose for 3 months. Otherwise, these medications are acceptable and will be kept stable during the entire protocol.\n6. Oral steroids unless patients present a low stable dose (e.g. 10 mg or less of prednisone per day or physiological doses, less than 35 mg/day, of hydrocortisone Cortef\u00ae). Inhale steroids at stable dose in the last month are acceptable.\n7. Other serious medical illness likely to interfere with study participation or with the ability to complete the trial by the judgment of the investigator (e.g. unstable psychiatric condition).\n8. Failure to comply with team's recommendations (e.g. not willing to change pump parameters, follow algorithm's suggestions, etc).\n9. Living or planned travel outside Montreal (\\> 1h of driving) area during closed-loop procedures."
