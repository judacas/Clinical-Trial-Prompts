    "officialTitle": "VO2 Max: In Vivo Model for Functional Red Cell Testing. Can RECESS be Explained?",
    "inclusionCriteria": "* Habitual exerciser defined as \u2265 30 minutes of at least moderate or high intensity exercise \u2265 3 times per week. After consent, and at the subsequent screening visit, a VO2 max test will be performed, and subjects with a low value (\\< 35 mL/kg/min) will be excluded (screen failure). Based on our previous experience, we anticipate that \\<10% of the subjects will fall into this category\n* Calculated total blood volume (TBV) \u22654,500 mL using an established formula:\n\n  1. Men: (0.006012 x H3) + (14.6 x W) + 604 = TBV\n  2. Women: (0.005835 x H3) + (15 x W) + 183 = TBV \\[H=height in inches; W=weight in pounds\\]\n* Has access to transportation to visit the blood collection facility and to return to Stony Brook for all study visits.\n* Must have minimum age of 18 Years\n* Must have maximum age of 40 Years",
