    "officialTitle": "A Prospective Evaluation of Natriuretic Peptide Based Referral of CHF Patients in Primary Care",
    "inclusionCriteria": "* Willing and able to provide written informed consent and accept study procedures and time schedule.\n* Age \u2265 18 years.\n* Patients suffering from chronic heart failure (the heart failure diagnosis must have been made or confirmed by a cardiologist and/or hospital physician at any time in the patient's medical history).\n* Patients with reduced ejection fraction (\u2264 40%) as confirmed at any time point in the patient's medical history.\n* Must have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusionCriteria": "* Use of investigational drugs either within 5 half-lives of enrollment, or within 30 days, or until the expected pharmacodynamic effect has returned to baseline, whichever is longer.\n* Major surgery in the last 3 months prior to baseline or planned major surgery or cardiac intervention during the study.\n* Cancer or other significant co-morbidities implying that the patient's condition is unstable.\n* Comorbidities that can be associated with elevated natriuretic peptide (NP) levels: renal insufficiency, (eGFR \\< 25 ml/min/1.73 m\u00b2 calculated according to MDRD formula), recent (less than 3 months) cerebral trauma or recent (less than 3 months) cerebrovascular incident, novel diagnosis or acute exacerbation of COPD within the last 3 months.\n* Patients who are primarily managed and regularly followed-up by a cardiologist for their HF\n* Highly frail patients whose estimated lifespan due to comorbidities by the judgement of the investigator is less than 6 months."
