    "officialTitle": "Intense Physiotherapies to Improve Function in Young Children With Cerebral Palsy",
    "inclusionCriteria": "1. Age: 12 to 36 months of age (The diagnosis of CP is often uncertain under the age of 12 months. The cutoff at 36 months is to have a population of young children when the brain is most \"plastic\" and most susceptible to reorganization).\n2. Diagnosis: Diagnosis of spastic CP confirmed by a pediatric neurologist or pediatric rehabilitation specialist.\n3. Etiology: The insult to the central nervous system that caused the motor dysfunction must have occurred during gestation or within one year after birth independent of gestational age.\n4. Disease severity level: Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) levels I, II and III.\n* Must have minimum age of 12 Months\n* Must have maximum age of 36 Months",
    "exclusionCriteria": "1. Diagnosis: Diagnosis of CP secondary to neuronal migration.\n2. Co-morbidities: Medical conditions that may prevent the administration of rehabilitation therapies at the intensity required by the study, or that may compromise the study ability to maintain blindness, or that have a co-morbidity not typically associated with CP (i.e. cancer, cystic fibrosis).\n3. Co-interventions: Anticipated pharmacological intervention or procedure or participation in other studies that may interfere with this study."
