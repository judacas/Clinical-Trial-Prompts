    "officialTitle": "Cardiac MRI After Replacement of Long Term Implanted PACEmakers by a MRI Conditional Pulse Generator (MRI-rePace)",
    "inclusionCriteria": "* Approved clinical indication for pectoral pacemaker exchange (e.g. elective replacement indication (ERI), end of service (EOS))\n* Implantation of a CE certified / market released MRI conditional pacemaker (BSCI) consistent of\n\n  * a single or dual chamber MRI conditional pacemaker (BSCI) or\n  * Any comparable successor IPG (MRI conditional system, BSCI) compatible with\n* Implanted Fineline-II-leads (BSCI), MRI conditional\n* Leads electrically intact and with stable and normal function\n\n  * The ascertained lead impedance is between 200 and 1500 Ohm.\n  * All pacing capture thresholds (PCT) do not exceed 2.0 V @0.4 or 0.5 ms in pacemaker dependent patients\n* Adherence to the MRI conditions of use is given\n\n  * Male or female 18 years or older\n  * Understand the nature of the procedure\n  * Give written informed consent\n  * Able to complete all testing required by the clinical protocol\n  * Ability to measure atrial and/or ventricular pacing threshold(s) at 0.4 or 0.5 ms\n  * Patient body height greater or equal to 140 cm\n  * Pectoral implanted device\n  * Subjects who are able and willing to undergo elective cardiac magnetic resonance (MR) scanning without sedation (MRI-group)\n  * Subjects who are geographically stable and available for follow-up at the study center for the length of the study\n* Must have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusionCriteria": "* \u2022 Non MRI conditional leads implanted\n\n  * Pacing threshold(s) (at 0.4 or 0.5 ms) and/or sensing amplitude(s) and/or impedance(s) are not measurable\n  * Meet one or more of the contraindications for MRI including Psychiatric disorders, anxiety, claustrophobia Cardiac disorders that represent a contraindication to MRI\n  * Cardiac surgery already scheduled in the next three months\n  * Have other medical implants that may interact with MRI, e.g. abandoned implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) leads or pacemaker leads other than MRI conditional, lead extensions, other active medical devices, non-MRI compatible devices, mechanical valve\n  * Have other metallic artifacts/components in body that may interact with MRI\n  * Subjects for whom a single dose of 1.0 milligram (mg) dexamethasone acetate may be contraindicated\n  * Subjects who require a legally authorized representative to obtain consent\n  * Subjects who are immediate candidates for an ICD\n  * Subjects with medical conditions that preclude the testing required by the protocol or limit study participation\n  * Subjects who are enrolled or intend to participate in another clinical trial (of an investigational drug or device, new indication for an approved drug or device, or requirement of additional testing beyond standard clinical practice) during this clinical study\n  * Being pregnant\n  * Have a life expectancy of less than three months\n  * Subjects with exclusion criteria required by local law (e.g. age, breastfeeding)"
