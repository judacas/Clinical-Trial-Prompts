    "inclusionCriteria": "* Prior Myocardial Infarction and\n* One of the following VT events while not being treated with amiodarone, sotalol, or another class I or class III antiarrhythmic drug) within the last 6 months:\n\n  * Sustained monomorphic VT documented on 12-lead ECG or rhythm strip terminated by pharmacologic means or DC cardioversion\n  * \u22653 episodes of VT treated with antitachycardia pacing (ATP), at least one of which was symptomatic\n  * \u2265 5 episodes of VT treated with antitachycardia pacing (ATP) regardless of symptoms\n  * \u22651 appropriate ICD shocks,\n  * \u22653 VT episodes within 24 hours\n* Must have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusionCriteria": "* Unable or unwilling to provide informed consent.\n* Active ischemia (acute thrombus diagnosed by coronary angiography, or dynamic ST segment changes demonstrated on ECG) or another reversible cause of VT (e.g. drug-induced arrhythmia), had recent acute coronary syndrome within 30 days, coronary revascularization (\\<90 days bypass surgery, \\<30 days percutaneous coronary intervention), or have CCS functional class IV angina.
