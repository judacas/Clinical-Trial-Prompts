    "officialTitle": "Multicenter, Randomized Study to Evaluate the Effectiveness of the Individualization of the Immunological Risk Based on Biomarkers (Disparity of HLA and IFN-\u03b3 ELISPOT) to Optimize Immunosuppressor Treatment in Living-donor Renal Recipients",
    "inclusionCriteria": "1. Adult men and women (\u226518 years).\n2. Receptors of a first kidney transplant from an incompatible HLA living donor (at least 1 mismatch HLA at any antigenic level).\n3. AB0 compatible transplant.\n4. Patients with a calculated PRA of 0% by solid phase technique and absence of anti-HLA class I and class II antibodies by single antigen test (Luminex\u00ae).\n5. Patients who agree to participate in the Trial by signing the Specific Informed Consent of this study.\n6. Potentially fertile women should use high reliability contraceptive methods (Pearl-Index \\<1) in order to avoid pregnancy during the entire duration of the study and up to 6 weeks after the end of their treatment with Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF). Potentially Fertile Women include any woman who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation or bilateral oophorectomy) or who is not post-menopausal (defined as amenorrhea \u2265 12 consecutive months, or women who are receiving hormone replacement therapy with a documented level of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)\\> 35 mlU / ml). Potentially fertile women must have a pregnancy test with a negative result in the 72 hours prior to the start of the trial.\n7. Sexually active males (including vasectomized males) who are being treated with MMF must accept the use of barrier contraceptive methods during MMF treatment and for 90 days thereafter. Potentially fertile partners of these patients should use a reliable contraceptive method during the same period, in order to minimize the risk of pregnancy.\n8. Patients must agree not to donate blood during treatment with MMF and during the 6 subsequent weeks. Males should not make a sperm donation during MMF treatment and up to 90 days after completion.\n* Must have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusionCriteria": "1. Patients with a calculated PRA higher than 0% per solid phase and / or anti-HLA class I and / or class II antibodies detectable by single antigen test (Luminex\u00ae).\n2. Positive result of Cross Match.\n3. Patients who receive a graft from a cadaver donor.\n4. Identical HLA patients\n5. Patients who have undergone a previous solid organ transplant (including kidney transplant) or who are going to receive another solid organ transplant concomitantly.\n6. Patients with any of the following basic renal diseases:\n\n   * Glomerular primary focal and segmental sclerosis\n   * Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) / thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura syndrome.\n7. Patients with chronic infection with Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and / or active infection with Hepatitis C virus (positive PCR result) at the time of transplant.\n8. Patients with infection with the known Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).\n9. Patients with active systemic infection that requires the continued administration of antibiotics.\n10. Patients with any neoplasm except localized skin cancer and who is receiving adequate treatment.\n11. Patients with severe anemia (hemoglobin \\<6g / dl), leukopenia (WBC \\<2500 / mm3) and / or thrombocytopenia (platelets \\<80,000 / mm3).\n12. Patients who are hemodynamically unstable even if they have hemoglobin levels\\> 6g / dL.\n13. Patients with intestinal pathology or severe diarrhea that may decrease absorption according to medical criteria.\n14. Patients with known hypersensitivity to any of the drugs used in this study.\n15. Patients who have received any investigational drug in the 30 days prior to their inclusion in this study.\n16. Potentially fertile women who do not agree to use reliable contraceptive measures during the trial, who are pregnant, breastfeeding or who present a positive pregnancy test at the time of their inclusion in the study.\n17. Patients who are legally detained in an official institution."
