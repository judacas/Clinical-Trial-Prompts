    "exclusionCriteria": "* Any MS relapse in the last five years, as determined at the screen visit by the PI\n* Any new or definitely enlarging T2/FLAIR lesion or new gadolinium-enhancing lesion within the past three years (at least two scans separated by at least three years must be reviewed) on brain or spine MRI scan. Lesions must be 3mm or larger to be exclusionary.\n* Significant (as defined by the PI) intolerance of presently-used DMT\n* More than two courses of acute, systemic (IV or oral) steroids in the last 5 years or any use within the last year. Course is defined as three or more days continuously, and not to exceed 14 days. No use of chronic, systemic steroids, defined as 15 or more days, in the last 5 years. Any use of steroids to treat MS relapse, possible relapse, or pseudo-relapse in the last 5 years.\n\n  * Use of inhaled or topical steroids are not an exclusion criteria.\n  * Use of oral steroids for no greater than 14 days given for a non-MS condition is not exclusionary.\n* Prior use of the following in the past 5 years:\n\n  * alemtuzumab,\n  * mitoxantrone,\n  * cyclophosphamide,\n  * methotrexate,\n  * cyclosporine,\n  * rituximab,\n  * siponimod, or\n  * cladribine\n* Prior use of any experimental agent used as a DMT for MS in the last five years\n* Other significant medical or psychiatric illness, if uncontrolled.
