    "officialTitle": "Radiographic Peri-implant Alveolar Bone Changes in Post-menopausal Osteoporotic Women",
    "inclusionCriteria": "* Participants must present a diagnosis of osteoporosis based on DXA measurement of the bone mineral density at the femur neck and/or total hip and/or lumbar spine (T value 2.5 SD or more below the young female adult mean) within the past 24 months.\n* Not in treatment with anti-resorptive agents (like bisphosphonates and denosumab) for more than 4 consecutive years, in order to reduce the risk of medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaws (Lo et al., 2010).\n* \u2265 50 years old.\n* In self-reported menopause, defined as the permanent cessation of ovulation, for at least one year (Soules et al., 2001).\n* Edentulous area involving a maximum of two teeth (wisdom teeth and second molars are excluded) and presenting at least one neighbouring tooth (e.g. gap in the area of a second premolar and first molar, with first premolar in place).\n* Residual alveolar width \u2265 4 mm (Milinkovic and Cordaro, 2014), residual alveolar height \\>8 mm, enough inter-arch space for a crown (at least 5 mm) and a minimum distance of 7 mm from the adjacent teeth (Shah and Lum, 2008). The width and height will be confirmed after x-ray examination in Visit 2.\n* Possibility to restore a functional occlusion with a minimum of four occlusal units (i.e. pairs of occluding posterior teeth).\n* Willingness to replace the missing tooth/teeth with dental implants\n* Registration with a GDP\n* Must be FEMALE\n* Must have minimum age of 50 Years",
    "exclusionCriteria": "* On chronic treatment (i.e., two weeks or more) with any medication severely affecting oral status (e.g. participants with gingival hypertrophy caused by anti-epileptics, calcium antagonists, cyclosporine and other immunosuppressive) or bone metabolism (e.g. anticoagulant medications, long-standing steroid medications -i.e. equal or more 2.5mg of prednisolone a day taken for \\>3 months -, anticonvulsants, immunosuppressants).\n* Affected by systemic diseases recognized to severely affect bone metabolism (e.g. Cushing's syndrome, Addison's disease, diabetes mellitus type 1, leukaemia, pernicious anaemia, malabsorption syndromes, chronic liver disease, rheumatoid arthritis).\n* Knowingly affected by HIV or Hepatitis.\n* History of local radiation therapy in the last five years.\n* Affected by limited mental capacity or language skills such that study information cannot be understood, informed consent cannot be obtained, or simple instructions cannot be followed.\n* Presenting an acute endodontic/periodontal lesion in the neighboring areas to the implant site.\n* Completely edentulous\n* With evident severe atrophy of the alveolar ridge that could preclude an implant placement (e.g. sharp knife edge ridge)\n* Severe bruxism or clenching habits\n* Smokers of \\> 5 cigarettes a day.\n* A daily alcohol intake \\>2 units/day.\n* Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality which may increase the risk associated with trial participation or investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the participant inappropriate for entry into this trial.\n* Patients unable or not willing to return for follow-ups."
