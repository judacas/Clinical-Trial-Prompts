    "officialTitle": "A Randomized, Open-label, Active-controlled, Parallel-group Study to Investigate the Platelet Inhibition of Ticagrelor Versus Clopidogrel in Patients With Stable Coronary Artery Disease and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus After Recent Elective Percutaneous Coronary Intervention",
    "inclusionCriteria": "1. Provision of written informed consent (by patient or appropriate designee according to local regulations) prior to any study specific procedures.\n2. Aged 18 years or older, male or female.\n3. Documented stable coronary artery disease (CAD) fulfilling any of the following:\n\n   * History of stable angina pectoris with angiographic evidence of CAD (diameter stenosis \u2265 50%) in major, i.e., left main, left anterior descending, left circumflex, and right coronary arteries.\n   * History of previous myocardial infarction (MI)\n   * History of coronary revascularization, i.e., percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), not including the elective PCI during the index hospitalization\n4. Documented history of type 2 diabetes mellitus.\n5. At least 24 hours after but within 14 days of angiographically successful elective PCI without complications.\n\n   * Post-procedural residual diameter stenosis of the treated lesions \\< 20% in patients with stent implantation or \\< 50% in those with balloon angioplasty\n   * Post-procedural thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) grade 3 flow in treated vessels\n6. Negative cardiac troponin test before the index elective PCI.\n7. Taking Clopidogrel 75 mg daily dose for at least 7 days or taking Clopidogrel 75 mg daily dose for less than 7 days but with 300 to 600 mg Clopidogrel loading dose before PCI.\n8. Taking acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) 100 mg daily treatment for at least 7 days or taking ASA 100 mg daily dose for less than 7 days but with 300 mg ASA loading dose before PCI.\n9. Females with childbearing potential (i.e., females who are not post-menopausal or surgically sterile) must:\n\n   * have a negative urine or blood pregnancy test at enrolment and prior to randomization;\n   * currently be using a hormonal contraceptive and agree to continue its use in addition to using double-barrier local contraception (i.e., intra-uterine device plus spermicidal and condom for male partner) from screening through study completion.\n* Must have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusionCriteria": "1. Patients who had acute coronary syndrome (ACS) within 12 months of screening.\n2. Occurrence of myocardial infarction (MI) related to index elective PCI (type 4a MI) or myocardial infarction related to stent thrombosis (type 4b MI) according to the Third Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction.\n3. Use of parenteral antithrombotic agents, e.g., glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (GPIs), bivalirudin, unfractionated heparin, enoxaparin or fondaparinux within 24 hours of screening.\n4. Use of any oral antithrombotic agents, with the exception of Clopidogrel and ASA, within 30 days of screening.\n5. Any other indications (e.g., atrial fibrillation, prosthetic heart valve, venous thromboembolism, ventricular thrombosis, et al) for antithrombotic treatment other than ASA 100 mg daily, Clopidogrel and Ticagrelor during study period.\n6. Concomitant therapy with moderate or strong cytochrome P-450 (CYP) 3A inhibitors, CYP 3A substrates with narrow therapeutic index, or strong CYP 3A inducers during study period.\n7. Concomitant therapy with moderate or strong CYP 2C19 inhibitors, CYP 2C19 substrates with narrow therapeutic index, or strong CYP 2C19 inducers during study period.\n8. Increased bleeding risk including:\n\n   * recent (within 30 days of screening) gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding;\n   * any history of intracranial, intraocular, retroperitoneal, or spinal bleeding;\n   * recent (within 30 days of screening) major trauma or major surgery;\n   * sustained uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure \\[SBP\\] \\> 180 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure \\[DBP\\] \\> 100 mmHg);\n   * history of hemorrhagic disorders that can increase the risk of bleeding, e.g., haemophilia, von Willebrand's disease;\n   * inability to discontinue required concomitant therapy with non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) at screening;\n   * platelet count less than 100,000/mm3 or hemoglobin \\< 10 g/dL.\n9. Contraindication or other reason that ASA, Clopidogrel, or Ticagrelor should not be administered (e.g., hypersensitivity, active bleeding \\[including active pathological bleeding\\], any bleeding tendency \\[coagulation defects\\], moderate and severe hepatic impairment, risk of bradycardia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic or active asthma, hyperuricemia, gout, etc.).\n10. History of intolerance to ASA, Clopidogrel or Ticagrelor.\n11. Patients that are scheduled for CABG during the study period.\n12. Patient requires dialysis or has a creatinine clearance (Clcr) \\< 30 mL/min as calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault equation: Clcr = (140 - Age) \u00d7 WT / (72 \u00d7 Scr) (\u00d7 0.85 for females), where WT is weight in kg, Scr is serum creatinine in mg/dL.\n13. Any acute or chronic unstable conditions in the past 30 days or other conditions which, in the opinion of the investigator, may either put the patient at risk or influence the result of the study (e.g., active cancer, risk for non-compliance, risk for being lost to follow-up).\n14. Participation in another investigational drug or device study within 30 days of screening.\n15. Involvement in the planning and conduct of the study (applies to investigators, contract research organization staff, and study site staff).\n16. History of drug addiction or alcohol abuse in the previous 2 years.\n17. Recent (within 30 days of screening) blood donation.\n18. Known pregnancy, breast-feeding, or intend to become pregnant during the study period."
