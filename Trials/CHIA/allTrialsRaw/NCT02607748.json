    "officialTitle": "18F-fluoride (18F-NaF) Positron Emission Tomography (PET) for Identification of Ruptured and High-Risk Coronary Atherosclerotic Plaques",
    "inclusionCriteria": "Three groups of patients will be recruited for this study.\n\n1. Acute Coronary Syndrome group: 40 patients with type 1 myocardial infarction within 21 days prior to the imaging visit and invasive coronary angiography with angiographic evidence of at least a 50% stenosis in one or more coronary arteries. Only patients undergoing PCI will be included in the study.\n2. Stable Ischemic Heart Disease group: 40 patients who have undergone invasive coronary angiography within 21 days prior to the imaging visit, with history of typical angina prior to the angiogram, but no prior myocardial infarction or coronary revascularization.\n3. Asymptomatic CAD group: 40 patients who have undergone Coronary Artery Calcium scanning within 6 months prior to the imaging visit, matched to the ACS patients for age, gender, and CAC score.\n\n   * Patients in the asymptomatic CAD group must\n\n     * have no prior CAD associated event (no prior myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, coronary angiogram, or PCI),\n     * have CAC between 10 to \\<1000, and\n     * match to patients in the ACS group by gender, age by decile, and CAC category (using CAC categories of 10 to \\<100, 100 to \\<400, 400 to \\<1000).\n* Must have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusionCriteria": "* Age \\< 18 years\n* Creatinine \\> 1.5 mg/dL\n* History of severe allergy to Iodine contrast agents\n* Pregnancy\n* Active atrial fibrillation\n* Multiple premature ventricular or atrial contractions\n* Ejection fraction \\<35%\n* Class III congestive heart failure"
