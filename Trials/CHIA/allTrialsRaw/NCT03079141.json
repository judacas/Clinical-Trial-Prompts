    "exclusionCriteria": "* Any previous treatments for active CSC;\n* Previous prescription of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, for cCSC or for other diseases;\n* Current treatment with corticosteroids (topical or systemic), corticosteroid use within 3 months before possible start of trial treatment, or anticipated start of corticosteroid treatment within the first 2 years from the start of the trial period;\n* Evidence of another diagnosis that can explain serous SRF or visual loss;\n* Best-corrected visual acuity \\< 20/200 (Snellen equivalent);\n* Profound chorioretinal atrophy in central macular area on ophthalmoscopy and OCT;\n* Myopia \\> 6D;\n* Visual loss and/or serous detachment on OCT \\< 6 weeks;\n* Continuous and/or progressive visual loss \\> 18 months or serous detachment on OCT \\> 18 months;\n* No hyperfluorescence on ICGA;\n* Intraretinal edema on OCT;\n* (relative) Contraindications for FA or ICGA;\n* (relative) Contraindications for photodynamic treatment (pregnancy, porphyria, severely disturbed liver function). Pregnancy will not be routinely tested in female patients, but the possibility of pregnancy will be discussed during screening\n* (relative) Known contraindications for initiation of eplerenone treatment (hyperkalemia, abnormal renal clearance, severe hepatic insufficiency (Child-Pugh C), type 2 diabetes mellitus with microalbuminuria, concomitant use of potassium supplements, potassium-sparing diuretics, strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, or the combination of an ACE-inhibitor and an angiotensin receptor blocking agent). Pregnancy will not be routinely tested in female patients, but the possibility of pregnancy will be discussed during screening;\n* Soft drusen in treated eye or fellow eye, signs of choroidal neovascularization on ophthalmoscopy and/or FA/ICGA of the study eye."
