    "officialTitle": "A Single-arm, Interventional, Multi-center, Pilot Study to Evaluate the Efficacy of Oral Bisoprolol on Heart Rate Reduction in Chinese Chronic Heart Failure Patients With NYHA Class II - IV (Biso-CHF Study)",
    "inclusionCriteria": "* 18-80 year, male or female.\n* Chronic Heart failure subjects with medical history of cardiac disease or other related cardiovascular disease.\n* Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than or equal to (=\\<) 40 percent (%).\n* New York Heart Association (NYHA) class of II - IV\n* NYHA II \uff1a Slight limitation of physical activity. Comfortable at rest, but ordinary physical activity results in undue breathlessness, fatigue or palpitation.\n* NYHA III\uff1aMarked limitation of physical activity. Comfortable at rest, but less than ordinary activity causes undue breathlessness, fatigue or palpitation.\n* NYHA IV\uff1aUnable to carry on any physical activity without discomfort. Symptoms at rest can be present. If any physical activity is undertaken, discomfort increased.\n* Signed Informed Consent Form (ICF).\n* Must have minimum age of 18 Years\n* Must have maximum age of 80 Years",
    "exclusionCriteria": "* Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) within 3 months.\n* Under beta-blocker treatment for the last 2 weeks.\n* Under other medicine treatment which may affect heart rate, like Non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (NDHP-CCBs) or ivabradine for the last 2 weeks; Under Digoxin treatment \\[more than (\\>) 0.125 milligram (mg)\\].\n* Uncontrolled Diabetes \\[hemoglobin A1c, (HbA1c) \\>7.5%\\].\n* Severe or uncontrolled hypertension \\[resting Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) \\>180 millimeters of mercury (mmHg), or resting Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) \\>110mmHg at screening period\\].\n* Severe hypotension \\[resting SBP less than (\\<) 90mmHg, or resting DBP\\<50mmHg\\].\n* Resting heart rate \\<60 beat per minute (bpm).\n* Any contradiction to Bisoprolol according to label, including:\n* Acute heart failure or during episodes of heart failure decompensation requiring intravenous inotropic therapy.\n* Cardiogenic shock.\n* Atrioventricular block of second or third degree (without a pacemaker).\n* Sick sinus syndrome.\n* Sinoatrial block.\n* Slowed heart rate, causing symptoms (symptomatic bradycardia),\n* Decreased blood pressure, causing symptoms (symptomatic hypotension),\n* Severe bronchial asthma or severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\n* Sever forms of peripheral arterial occlusive disease and Raynaud's syndrome.\n* Untreated phaeochromocytoma.\n* Metabolic acidosis.\n* Hypersensitivity to bisoprolol or to any of the excipients.\n* Severe Arrhythmia including atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, ventricular fibrillation, ventricular flutter or ventricular tachycardia.\n* Significant valvular heart disease, congenital heart disease, pulmonary heart disease or perinatal heart disease.\n* Acute pulmonary edema.\n* Severe hepatic dysfunction, defined as:\n* Serum Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) \\> triple the upper limit of the normal range; and/or\n* Serum Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) \\> triple the upper limit of the normal value range and/or\n* Severe renal dysfunction, defined as:\n* Serum creatinine \\> twice the upper limit of the normal range\n* Chronic Kidney Disease (glomerular filtration rate \\<45 Milliliter per minute).\n* Hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism.\n* Severe infectious disease, example (eg) Human Immunodeficiency Virus positive or active tuberculosis.\n* Severe autoimmune disease, e.g. lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis.\n* Severe respiratory, digestive, hematological disease (including Anemia of Hb \\< 100 gram per litre) or tumor.\n* Known to be hypersensitivity to Bisoprolol, or any of the excipient.\n* Substance or alcohol abuse.\n* Received heart transplantation or pacemaker implantation; revascularization treatment within 3 months; or plan to receive above treatment in 6 months.\n* Currently undertaking other treatment that may affect the safety and/or efficacy evaluation, e.g. beta receptors agonists, et cetera.\n* No legal ability or legal ability is limited.\n* Subjects unlikely to cooperate in the study or with inability or unwillingness to give informed consent.\n* Child-bearing period women without effective contraceptive measures, pregnancy and lactation.\n* Participation in another clinical trial within the past 90 days.\n* Other significant condition that in the Investigator's opinion would exclude the subject from the trial."
