    "officialTitle": "A Pilot Study of Image-Guided Navigation for High Dose Rate Temporary Interstitial Brachytherapy in the Palliative Management of Previously Treated Tumors of the Spine and Pelvis",
    "inclusionCriteria": "* Patients must have histologic proof of a malignancy suitable for radiation therapy.\n* Patients must have received prior external beam radiation therapy to the region proposed for HDR brachytherapy treatment; evaluation of doses previously delivered to spinal cord/cauda equine, pelvis, and other critical structures (bowel, kidneys, rectum) will be taken into consideration.\n* If repeat irradiation would exceed any normal tissue constraint set by MSKCC Radiation Oncology Department dose constraint criteria, the patient will potentially be eligible.\n* If the total prior radiation dose to the cord or pelvis exceeds 100 Gy BED equivalent, the patient will be potentially eligible, where a total of 100 BED Gy equivalent is determined by the biological equivalent dose (BED) calculation; BED = nd(1 + d/\u03b1/\u03b2), where n = number of fractions and d = dose per fraction; \u03b1/\u03b2 is the constant for spinal cord late effect and equals 2. \\[Rades 2005, Nieder 2005, Sahgal 2012\\]\n* KPS \u2265 60\n* Age \u2265 18 years old\n* Must have minimum age of 18 Years",
    "exclusionCriteria": "* Patients who may receive therapeutically effective doses via an external beam approach to the lesion of interest as specified by MSKCC Radiation Oncology Department dose constraint criteria.\n* Patients with kyphoplasty cement or hardware that would preclude effective catheter placement.\n* Patients with paraspinal extension of disease with visceral involvement.\n* Abnormal complete blood count. Any of the following:\n* Platelet count \\< 75,000/ml\n* Hb level \\< 9gm/dl\n* WBC \\< 3.5/ml\n* Abnormal coagulation profile: INR \\> 2.5 and/or PTT \\> 80\n* Patients who are on anticoagulation medication that may not be safely held for the procedure (\u2265 5 days for antiplatelet agents and warfarin; \u2265 24 hours for low-molecular weight heparin formulations) will be excluded.\n* Contraindications to general anesthesia"
