    "inclusionCriteria": "* Present to ED primary for management of LBP, defined as pain originating between the lower border of the scapulae and the upper gluteal folds. Flank pain, that is pain originating from tissues lateral to the paraspinal muscles, will not be included.\n* Musculoskeletal etiology of low back.

The primary clinical diagnosis, at the conclusion of the ED visit, must be a diagnosis consistent with non-traumatic, non-radicular, musculoskeletal LBP.\n* Patient is to be discharged home. Patients admitted to the hospital are more likely to be treated with parenteral medication and therefore are not appropriate for this study.\n* Age 18-64 Enrollment will be limited to adults younger than 65 years because of the increased risk of adverse medication effects in the elderly.\n* Non-radicular pain. Patients will be excluded if the pain radiates below the gluteal folds in a radicular pattern.\n* Pain duration \\<2 weeks (336 hours). Patients with more than two weeks of pain are at increased risk of poor pain and functional outcomes.(9)\n* Prior to the acute attack of LBP, back pain cannot occur more frequently than once per month. Patients with more frequent back pain are at increased risk of poor pain and functional outcomes.(9)\n* Non-traumatic LBP: no substantial and direct trauma to the back within the previous month\n* Functionally impairing back pain: A baseline score of \\> 5 on the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire\n* Must have minimum age of 18 Years",
