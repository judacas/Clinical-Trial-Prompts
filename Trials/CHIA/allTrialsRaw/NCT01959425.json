    "officialTitle": "Safety of Oral Anticoagulation Therapy Withdrawal After Successful Cardiac Ablation in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation and Associated High Risk Factors for Embolic Events (OAT Pilot Study)",
    "inclusionCriteria": "1. Successful cardiac ablation for AF\n2. Documented freedom from AF recurrence (symptomatic or asymptomatic arrhythmic recurrences lasting longer than 30 seconds) 3 months after successful cardiac ablation (AF recurrence during 3-month blanking period is excluded).\n3. Patient must have been on a commercially approved anticoagulation therapy for at least two (2) months prior to randomization in the OAT Study.\n4. CHADS2 score \u2265 2 or CHA2DS2-VASc score (\u22653)\n5. Left ventricular ejection fraction \\> 25%\n6. LA size \\< 65\n7. High risk for thromboembolic events (i.e., CHADS2 score \u2265 2 or CHA2DS2-VASc score \u2265 3) and require OAT before undergoing cardiac ablation\n8. Able and willing to comply with all pre- and follow-up testing and requirements\n9. Signed informed consent form\n10. Age 18 years or older\n* Must have minimum age of 18 Years\n* Must have maximum age of 90 Years",
    "exclusionCriteria": "1. OAT required for reasons not related to AF (i.e., prosthetic valve, PV stenosis, previous pulmonary embolism, presence of spontaneous echo contrast \\[SEC\\] at standard echo performed at 3-months follow-up).\n2. Any cardiac surgery within the past 60 days (2 months) or valvular cardiac surgical procedure at any time (i.e., ventriculotomy, atriotomy, and valve repair or replacement and presence of a prosthetic valve)\n3. Previous myocardial infarction (MI) or a percutaneous coronary intervention PCI within the past 3 months\n4. Awaiting cardiac transplantation or other cardiac surgery within the next 365 days (12 months)\n5. Documented left atrial thrombus\n6. Significant pulmonary disease, (e.g., restrictive pulmonary disease, constrictive or COPD) or any other disease or malfunction of the lungs or respiratory system that produces chronic symptoms\n7. Significant medical problem that in the opinion of the investigator would preclude enrollment in this study\n8. Women who are pregnant (as evidenced by pregnancy test if pre-menopausal)\n9. Acute illness or active systemic infection or sepsis\n10. Unstable angina\n11. Contraindication to anticoagulation (i.e., heparin, warfarin or another commercially available anticoagulation medication)\n12. History of blood clotting or bleeding abnormalities\n13. Life expectancy less than 360 days (12 months)\n14. Uncontrolled Heart Failure or NYHA Class III or IV heart failure\n15. Enrollment in a clinical study evaluating another device or drug, within the past 6 months\n16. Unable or unwilling to comply with protocol requirements"
