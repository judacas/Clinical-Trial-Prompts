Male patients who normally abstain from sexual activity may be recruited, providing they remain abstinent during the study, or if they become sexually active, they must agree to use a barrier method as described above.\n7.

Patients with a history of epilepsy, subjects currently prescribed treatments for epilepsy, or subjects with a history of seizure in the last 5 years.\n10.
