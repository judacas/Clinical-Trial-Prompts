If an effusion greater than 100 ml is documented by cytology to be free from malignancy and the investigator feels the patient is capable of receiving chemo/radiotherapy for their primary disease/ NSCLC, the investigator should discuss the patient with the study physician at Amgen. Effusions smaller than 100 ml would be acceptable, unless the investigator suspects that the effusion is malignant, in which case the effusions should be evaluated by cytology. Sponsor approval must be obtained before patient is randomized.\n* Plan to remove the tumor surgically before completing the protocol chemo/radiotherapy course\n* Shielding of any part of the esophagus during radiotherapy (including posterior spinal cord shielding)\n* Prior chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or surgery for NSCLC\n* Prior invasive malignancy during the past 3 years other than non-melanomatous skin cancer. Note: Patients with prior surgically-cured malignancies \\[eg, stage I breast cancer or prostate cancer, in-situ carcinoma of the cervix, etc\\] are not excluded; however, sponsor approval must be obtained before patient is randomized.\n* Presence or history of dysphagia or conditions predisposing to dysphagia (eg, uncontrolled gastroesophageal reflux disease \\[GERD\\], dyspepsia, etc)\n* History of pancreatitis\n* Four weeks or less since completion of treatment using an investigational product/device in another clinical study or presence of any unresolved toxicity from previous treatment\n* Previous treatment on this study or with a fibroblast growth factor\n* Known to be sero-positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), or hepatitis B virus (HBV)\n* Pregnant or breastfeeding women\n* Known sensitivity to E. coli derived products\n* Compromised ability of the patient to give written informed consent and/or to comply with study procedures\n* Refusal to sign an informed consent form to participate in this study, and sign the hospital information release form, if applicable\n* Unwilling or unable to complete the patient reported outcome (PRO) questionnaires\n* Psychological, social, familial, or geographical reasons that would prevent regular follow-up\n\nsex: ALL\n\nminimumAge: 18 Years\n\nstdAges: ['ADULT', 'OLDER_ADULT']",
