Able to swallow the liquid study drug.\n6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 2\n7. In the absence of rapidly progressing disease, the interval from prior treatment to time of AC220 administration will be at least 2 weeks for cytotoxic agents or at least 5 half-lives for noncytotoxic agents. The use of chemotherapeutic or antileukemic agents other than hydroxyurea is not permitted during the study with the possible exception of intrathecal (IT) therapy at the discretion of the Investigator and with the agreement of the Sponsor.\n8. Persistent chronic clinically significant non-hematological toxicities from prior treatment must be ≤Grade 1.\n9. Prior therapy with FLT3 inhibitors is permitted, except previous treatment with AC220.\n10. Serum creatinine ≤1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) \\> 30 mL/min\n11. Serum potassium, magnesium, and calcium levels should be at least within institutional normal limits.\n12. Total serum bilirubin ≤1.5 × ULN\n13. Serum aspartate transaminase (AST) and/or alanine transaminase (ALT) ≤2.5 × ULN\n14. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test (urine β-hCG).\n15. Females of childbearing potential and sexually mature males must agree to use a medically accepted method of contraception throughout the study.\n16. Written informed consent must be provided.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Patients over the age of 85 years except at the discretion of the Investigator and with agreement of the Sponsor.\n2. Diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia\n3. Diagnosis of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in blast crisis\n4. AML in relapse or refractory after 3 or more previous lines of chemotherapy (and/or HSCT) treatment\n5. AML or antecedent MDS secondary to prior chemotherapy\n6. Persistent clinically significant non-hematological toxicity that is Grade \\>1 by NCI CTCAE v4 from prior chemotherapy\n7. Patients who have had HSCT and are within 100 days of transplant and/or are still taking immunosuppressive drugs and/or have clinically significant graft-versus-host disease requiring treatment and/or have \\>Grade 1 persistent non hematological toxicity related to the transplant\n8. Clinically active central nervous system (CNS) leukemia. Patients with CNS leukemia, which is controlled, but who are still receiving IT therapy at study entry may be considered eligible and continue receive IT therapy at the discretion of the Investigator and with agreement of the Sponsor.\n9. Patients who have previously received AC220\n10. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) (diagnosis by laboratory or clinical assessment)\n11. Major surgery within 4 weeks prior to enrollment in the study\n12. Radiation therapy within 4 weeks prior to, or concurrent with study\n13. Use of concomitant drugs that prolong the time between the start of the Q wave and the end of the T wave (QT)/corrected interval between the Q wave and T wave (QTc) interval and/or are CYP3A4 inhibitors are prohibited with the exception of antibiotics, antifungals, and other antimicrobials that are used as standard of care to prevent or treat infections and other such drugs that are considered absolutely essential for the care of the patient.\n14. Uncontrolled or significant cardiovascular disease\n15. Women who are pregnant, lactating, or unwilling to use contraception if of childbearing potential\n16. Men who are unwilling to use contraception if their partners are of childbearing potential\n17. Active, uncontrolled infection\n18. Human immunodeficiency virus positivity\n19.
