possible thought but it might be more accurate to instead of trying to do top to bottom we do bottom to top for structurizing. meaning that we first just try to completely separate every tiny little thing into criterions. then we see if any of them can combine into a main and qualifier for atomic criterion or just main for atomic criterion. then we join the atomic criterions via compound or hierarchical depending on how they interact with each other until they are all joined. kind of reminds of union find.
