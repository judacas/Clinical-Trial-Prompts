Notes:

Are your bone marrow, renal and hepatic functions within the acceptable ranges as specified in the trial eligibility criteria?

question tries to have reader read the eligibility criteria. need to make it clear that the user will not have access to this criteria and it must relist it. 


injectable lesion question did not have size specifications. I should require chat gpt to write out any specific measurements

does not mention central nervous system metastatis

no mention of not having organ allograft transplantation

mentions not having bleeding or coagulopathy diseases but not anemia

mentions not taking autoimmune suppressive therapy but does not mention not having an autoimmune disease

fails to mention not having surgery within 14 days or not having recovered from previous surgeries

mentions things from Description such as 18+ that were not in eligibility criteria



After trying to put two clinical trials in one on question 7 trial 2 it said MUST have prior ANTI CTLA4 therapy, it should have said could have. this was fixed if it was asked in a seperate thread. seperate thread still makes user look or know what the protocol is for specific measurements

should specify that I need only one list of questions with must and must not. that inclusion is must and exclusion is must not
