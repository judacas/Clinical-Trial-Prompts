what if a better way to represent variables is with a topic, value, and notes. so its similar to mql but no longer has to deal with specific data types, however it makes grouping much easier and additionally no longer has to deal with more complex boolean equations for all the exceptions, instead putting them in notes. 
downside is if different topics have the same variables for notes then it would go back to asking the same thing multiple times, need to see how often this would happen to determine if it is worth addressing. 

Through testing I would tell the ai that I am between 18 and 99 years old which is sufficient for the ai to understand that I am an adult. however it would continue to ask for my specific age for its "medical records" which is not necessary. It only stopped once I specifically told it that it doesn't have any medical records and just needs to know between 18 and 99
