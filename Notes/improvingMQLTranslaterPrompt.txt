Context:You will be given a boolean algebra representation of criteria to participate in a clinical trial. While the Boolean algebra representation uses logical operators like "$and", "$or", and "$not", which are consistent with MQL, the internal key-value pairs do not follow MQL's conventions. Your job is to ensure that both the operators and their internal content align with MQL standards.

Guidelines:

Use MQL logical operators ["$and", "$or", "$not"]. They represent the relationship between individual criteria.

For number-based criteria, use numerical equality operators ["$eq", "$ne", "$gt", "$gte", "$lt", "$lte"]

For categorical-based criteria, use categorical equality operators ["$in", "$nin"]

Ensure a single condition for each segment.

Avoid making assumptions; translate only the given text.

Be concise when possible without removing clarity.

The entire thing must be surrounded in curly brackets {}. This is critical for it to be valid MQL

If the property can be read standalone, then make it a true or false statement.

in the case of a range of numbers, use both a "$gt" and an "$lt"

Additional Requirements:

In cases where numbers are presented in roman numerals, convert them to the Arabic number system. For example:
AVOID: "cancer stage" : {"$lte": III}
PREFER: "cancer stage":{"$lte":3}

In cases where numbers are presented in word form (e.g., 'eighteen' instead of '18'), convert them to their numeric counterparts.
AVOID: "ECOG status" : {"$gt" : "four"}
PREFER: "ECOG status" : {"$gt": 4}

Always place numbers in the value, not the property. for example:
AVOID: "age greater than 18": true
PREFER: "age": {"$gt": 18}

Prefer numbers over descriptive words whenever possible. For example:
AVOID: "age" : "Adult"
PREFER: "age": {"$gt": 18, "$lt": 65}.

All timeframes, whether they are in weeks, months, years, or days, should be translated into a representation in days. 1 week = 7 days. 1 month is approximately 30 days. 1 year = 365 days. For example:
AVOID: "weeks since last chemotherapy": {"$lt": 3}
PREFER: "days since last chemotherapy": {"$lt": 21}

Do not output a mathematical expression; instead,  compute the expression. For example:
AVOID: "days since last radiation": {"$lt": 4 * 30}
PREFER:"days since last radiation":{"$lt":120}

When a criterion relates to the timeframe a patient has been off a medication or treatment, use a numerical representation to indicate the number of days since the last time they received that medication or treatment. Remember to represent timeframes in days. For example:
AVOID: "has had immunotherapy of any kind within the last 2 years": true
PREFER: "days since last immunotherapy": {"$gt": 730}

Don't use "$exists", instead, represent conditions as booleans. For example:
AVOID: "prior systematic therapy" : {"$exists" : true}
PREFER: "has prior systematic therapy": true

Prefer categories over booleans when possible.
AVOID: "has lung cancer": true
PREFER: "cancer type": "lung cancer"

Do not capitalize anything unless it is an acronym or a specific term/medicine. for example
AVOID: "Able to consent"
PREFER: "able to consent"

Make conditions specific, for example:
AVOID:"stage"
PREFER:"Cancer Stage"

Format:
Every MongoDB operator and condition must be surrounded by double quotes.
All brackets (both [] and {}) must be appropriately paired and closed.
Your response MUST adhere to JSOM and MQL formatting standards.


Refer to the provided example for a clearer understanding of the input and expected output.

given the following input:
"$and": [
    {
        "$or": [
            {
                "black race"
            },
            {
                "white race"
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "non-Hispanic ethnicity"
    },
    {
        "$and": [
            {
                "age 19-65 years"
            },
            {
                "able to travel to the UAB Bionutrition Unit daily to retrieve meals"
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "$not": {
            "$or": [
                {
                    "has gastrointestinal (GI) conditions"
                },
                {
                    "has taken antibiotics or probiotics in the past 3 months"
                },
                {
                    "smokes/uses tobacco"
                },
                {
                    "consumes heavy alcohol"
                },
                {
                    "has major medical conditions"
                }
            ]
        }
    }
]

you would provide the following MQL:
{
	"$and": [
		{
			"$or": [
				{
					"race": "black"
				},
				{
					"race": "white"
				}
			]
		},
		{
			"ethnicity": {
				"$ne": "hispanic"
			}
		},
		{
			"$and": [
				{
					"age": {
						"$gte": 19,
						"$lte": 65
					}
				},
				{
					"able to travel daily": true
				}
			]
		},
		{
			"$not": {
				"$or": [
					{
						"has gastrointestinal (GI) conditions": true
					},
					{
						"number of days since taken antibiotics or probiotics": {
							"$lt": 90
						}
					},
					{
						"smokes/uses tobacco": true
					},
					{
						"consumes heavy alcohol": true
					},
					{
						"has major medical conditions": true
					}
				]
			}
		}
	]
}
