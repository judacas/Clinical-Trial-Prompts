		"detailedDescription": "Pancreatic cancer is the twelfth most common cancer worldwide. Neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy in patients with borderline resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma has become standard of care and is associated with higher rates of complete resection ultimately with improvement of overall survival in this patient population. Radiation therapy to a soft tissue organ such as the pancreas can be difficult, as it is not readily visualized radiographically. Image guided radiation therapy (IGRT) is a commonly implemented modality for delivering high doses of radiation directed at cancer tissue, while reducing collateral damage to adjacent healthy tissue. Fiducials, which are inert radiographic markers typically made from gold or carbon, can be placed in and around the tumor to delineate tumor margins to allow for IGRT Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has been pivotal in accomplishing IGRT by allowing precise contouring and identification of target lesions in the pancreas via placement of fiducials. This has traditionally been accomplished with the use of 19-gauge or 22-gauge fine needle aspiration (FNA) needles. To prepare the needle for fiducial placement, one to two fiducials are manually back-loaded into the tip of the needle after the stylet has been removed. In order to hold the fiducials within the needle, sterile lubrication or bone wax can be applied. Once the pancreatic mass has been targeted, fiducial injection can be accomplished via stylet reinsertion or sterile water injection. Currently, back-loading the fiducials is the only option for preparing delivery of fiducials via the EUS approach. Difficulties associated with fiducial loading and deployment can increase procedure duration due to cumbersome fiducial back-loading, fiducial misplacement \\& migration, as well as inability to pass the fiducial marker through the needle due to endoscope angulation. Observational studies have sited a technical success rate of 86-100% using 19 and/or 22 gauge needles with average procedure time between 7-12 minutes using the fiducial back-loading technique.\n\nA new mode of fiducial delivery has recently been developed that hopes to circumvent some of the technical issues inherent to traditional fiducial marker loading and deployment. A prototype 22-Gauge EUS needle preloaded with four fiducials has been used in a porcine models with successful deployment 95.6% of the time all accurate on predetermined targets. They were deemed easy to pass, relatively easy to deploy, and easily visualized on EUS, with excellent fluoroscopic and CT visualization. In addition, time for deployment was on average less than 60 seconds.\n\nTo date, there is no randomized controlled trials comparing total duration of time needed for placement of fiducials using technical success of the traditional back- loading technique of fiducial markers to the new preloaded needles in regards to EUS based fiducial marker placement for IGRT in pancreatic cancer.\n\nThis will be a multicenter randomized controlled trial. Randomization be performed and patients will undergo Linear EUS and have fiducial marker placement via a traditional 22G back-loaded needle (Visicoil) or the new 22G preloaded needle (PreLoad4). Multiple endpoints will be recorded, including total length of procedure, how many markers are successfully deployed, and technical success (Ease of passage of delivery system, ease of deployment of fiducials, EUS visualization of delivery system needle, EUS visual appearance of fiducials, and time for fiducial placement defined as starting at time of removing the needle from its packaging and ending time as removal of needle after final marker deployment). Fiducial marker location will be confirmed via fluoroscopy at time of placement and on 4D treatment planning CT ordered by the radiation oncologist for simulation. Patients will be discharged home after post procedure recovery. Patients will be contacted at home by a research coordinator or endoscopy staff 24-48 hours and 7-10 days after the procedure to document any immediate and delayed complications. Patients will return for their IGRT visit, and any evidence of fiducial marker migration will be recorded by the radiation oncologist.\n\nHypotheses\n\nUse of a 22 G preloaded needle for EUS guided fiducial marker placement in patients with pancreatic cancer will:\n\n1. Be delivered in at least require 60% less of the procedure time that it takes for traditional back-loaded 22G needles\n2. Improve overall procedure efficiency\n3. Maintain comparable technical success and adverse event rates.\n\nPrimary Aims\n\n1) To compare the procedure time of 22G needle placement of three Visicoil fiducial markers and 22G needle preloaded fiducial markers.\n\nSecondary Aims\n\n1.

		"briefSummary": "The study investigators will recruit a generally healthy sample of 112 black and white adults from Birmingham, AL to participate in a 28-day randomized, controlled feeding study. Participants will be randomized to receive either the DASH diet or a standard American diet. All meals will be provided by the study. Fecal samples will be collected at multiple time points before, during, and after the dietary intervention and will be analyzed using PCR to amplify the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene and to sequence bases using the MiSeq platform. Sequenced data will then be analyzed using QIIME. The investigators hypothesize that participants receiving the DASH diet will have a greater increase in alpha diversity and greater changes in abundances of CRC-associated microbes than participants receiving the standard American diet. The investigators will also evaluate functional-level markers including bile acid and short chain fatty acid (SCFA) production and inflammatory markers. If the investigator's hypothesis is supported, they expect to see reduced production of secondary bile acids (e.g., deoxycholic acid), greater SCFA production (e.g, butyrate), and reduction in gut and systemic inflammation (e.g, calprotectin, IL-6) among participants receiving the DASH diet compared to the standard American diet. The investigator's findings will provide preliminary evidence for the DASH diet as an approach for cultivating a healthier gut microbiota across racially diverse populations. These findings can impact clinical, translational, and population-level approaches for modification of the gut microbiota to reduce risk of chronic diseases like CRC.",

patients should continue contraceptive measures for 6 months from the last dose of all study medications; patients should be informed that taking the study medication may involve unknown risks to the fetus (unborn baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the study; in order to participate in the study they must adhere to the contraception requirement (described above) for the duration of the study and during the follow-up period defined; if there is any question that a patient will not reliably comply with the requirements for contraception, that patient should not be entered into the study; pregnancy: If a patient inadvertently becomes pregnant while on treatment with MK-3475, the patient will immediately be removed from the study; the site will contact the patient at least monthly and document the patient's status until the pregnancy has been completed or terminated; the outcome of the pregnancy will be reported without delay and within 24 hours if the outcome is a serious adverse experience (e.g., death, abortion, congenital anomaly, or other disabling or life-threatening complication to the mother or newborn); the study investigator will make every effort to obtain permission to follow the outcome of the pregnancy and report the condition of the fetus or newborn; if a male patient impregnates his female partner the study personnel at the site must be informed immediately and the pregnancy reported and followed; it is unknown whether MK-3475 is excreted in human milk; since many drugs are excreted in human milk, and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the nursing infant, patients who are breast-feeding are not eligible for enrollment\n* Patients who are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive may participate IF they meet the following eligibility requirements:\n\n  * They must be stable on their anti-retroviral regimen, and they must be healthy from an HIV perspective\n  * They must have a cluster of differentiation (CD)4 count of greater than 250 cells/mcL\n  * They must not be receiving prophylactic therapy for an opportunistic infection\n* Has known active hepatitis B (e.g., hepatitis B surface antigen \\[HBsAg\\] reactive) or hepatitis C (e.g., hepatitis C virus \\[HCV\\] ribonucleic acid \\[RNA\\] \\[qualitative\\] is detected)\n* Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment\n* History within 6 months prior to treatment of myocardial infarction, severe/unstable angina pectoris, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV congestive heart failure (CHF), stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA)\n* History within 3 months prior to treatment of grade 3-4 gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding/hemorrhage, treatment resistant peptic ulcer disease, erosive esophagitis or gastritis, infectious or inflammatory bowel disease, diverticulitis, pulmonary embolus, or other uncontrolled thromboembolic event\n* Patients who are less than 4 weeks post-operative (op) after major surgery",

		"briefSummary": "This phase II trial studies the best dose and effect of tocilizumab in combination with atezolizumab and stereotactic radiation therapy in treating glioblastoma patients whose tumor has come back after initial treatment (recurrent). Tocilizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to receptors for a protein called interleukin-6 (IL-6), which is made by white blood cells and other cells in the body as well as certain types of cancer. This may help lower the body's immune response and reduce inflammation. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy uses special equipment to precisely deliver multiple, smaller doses of radiation spread over several treatment sessions to the tumor. The goal of this study is to change a tumor that is unresponsive to cancer therapy into a more responsive one. Therapy with fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy in combination with tocilizumab may suppress the inhibitory effect of immune cells surrounding the tumor and consequently allow an immunotherapy treatment by atezolizumab to activate the immune response against the tumor. Combination therapy with tocilizumab, atezolizumab and fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy may shrink or stabilize the cancer better than radiation therapy alone in patients with recurrent glioblastoma.",
