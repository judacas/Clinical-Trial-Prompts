make it actually write down the meanings of words before checking if they mean the same thing to avoid it merging words that are just always next to each other.

will have issue that sometimes it might be in the exclusion and other times it might be in the inclusion so it might be worded oppositely and mess things up. such as age can't be less than 18 vs age must be over 18.

might also have the problem where it explains things. for example when it says  coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia (INR \\>1.5, platelets \\<75). the parenthesis is just an explanation of what constitutes coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia, which can be used in the asking the user section but not the requirements section.


update seperator sometimes has ANDs inside of ANDs and ORs inside of ORs which is technicaly unneccesary but does not make it less accurate and does not impact performance so will leave it be as a known bug.

A possible proplem could be not just the different properties but also different values. This is much more dangerous. For example If there are options for both cancer: lung and cancer: lung cancer then depending on which one I pick some clinical trials could get removed even though I still fit the criteria


prompt is getting quite long so with only 4k tokens the prompt and input might not leave any remaining tokens for the output. may need to make a function which splits up clinical trials to then make parts of the mql and then put it all back together

Being specific and providing specific examples in prompt helps with consistency.
