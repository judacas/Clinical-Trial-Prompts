Patients with total occluded vessels of unknown duration or existing longer than one month and a reference over 1.50 mm should not be included, not even as a third or fourth vessel to be dilated;\n7. Significant stenosis has been defined as a stenosis of more than 50% in luminal diameter (in at least one view, on visual interpretation or preferably by QCA);\n8. Left ventricular ejection fraction should be at least 30%.\n* Must have minimum age of 18 Years\n* Must have maximum age of 80 Years",
                "exclusionCriteria": "1. Congestive heart failure;\n2. CABG or Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) procedure;\n3. Planned need for major surgery (e.g. valve surgery or resection of aortic or left ventricular aneurysm, carotid end-arterectomy, abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery etc.);\n4. Congenital heart disease;\n5. Transmural myocardial infarction within the previous seven days and CK has not returned to normal;\n6. Chest pain lasting longer than 30 minutes within 12 hours pre-procedure, if CK enzymes positive (\u2265 2x the normal upper limit).\n7. History of any cerebrovascular accident;\n8. Left main stenosis of 50% or more;\n9. Intention to treat more than 1 totally occluded major epicardial vessel;\n10. Single vessel (single territory) disease."
